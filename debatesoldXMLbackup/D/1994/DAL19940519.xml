      <P>The Government has consistently refused a further debate in this House on the revised National Plan.  We have to read the newspapers to find out what has been dropped from the plan. Can the Taoiseach confirm a story in today's newspapers that the light rail system for Dublin is being dropped or grossly modified, or does he intend to allow his chosen Fianna Fáil candidate for the European Parliament to announce the project some days before the European elections?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, on 27 April, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Justice informed the House that on the basis of her own detailed knowledge of the particular area in question &mdash; that is the County Galway region &mdash; under the powers conferred on her by section 6 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, she directed the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to switch district headquarters from Oughterard to Salthill.

The Minister for Justice sat silently in this House yesterday but admitted in the Seanad last night that she does interfere in the prison system in the same way, <Col N="1813" /> based on her personal knowledge.  How long will prisoners and the Garda Síochána have to suffer the trauma of political corruption?  What has happened to the spirit of public service?  Instead the Minister, in self interest is using the prison system and the Garda Síochána to buttress herself in her constitutency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for coming into the House to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some coroners experience difficulties in having post-mortems carried out.  They are approximately 3,500 death certificates issued by coroners each year and before issuing them many coroners would like to have a post-mortem performed on the deceased.  At weekends when the services of a pathologist are not required in the hospitals to which they are attached, coroners frequently experience difficulties in having a post-mortem carried out within a reasonable time.  In <Col N="1846" /> other words, if a person dies suddenly on a Friday evening and a coroner wants to have a post-mortem performed on the deceased he might have to wait until Monday and as a result the deceased might not be buried until the following Wednesday.  That places a major imposition on the relatives of the deceased persons especially in our culture where there is a great deal of respect for the deceased and people like to carry out burials in accordance with tradition.  I accept that is not the position in other countries where it is usual to keep a body for a number of days before burial.</P>
    <P>In a coroner's district with which I am familiar pathologists have not been available since 6 May last.  This creates major difficulties for the coroner, the local authority and the health board.  These difficulties arise not only because pathologists are not available in hospitals at weekends, but also because when the health boards were established responsibility for post-mortems remained with the coroner, who is an employee of the local authority.  When local authorities were responsible for health matters they employed pathologists, but that is no longer the case.  Since the establishment of the health boards the position has been difficult for coroners.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister review the Coroners Act in consultation with the coroners association, the local authorities and the health boards?  A coroner who is unable to have a post-mortem performed is placed in a very difficult position as he or she must take blame by the relatives. While health boards are responsible for employing pathologists, they do not have responsibility under the Coroners Act and must also take much criticism for delays in carrying out post-mortems.</P>
    <P>A great deal of inconvenience is caused by coroners insisting that the body of a deceased should be removed to a hospital within their jurisdiction for the purposes of a post-mortem.  If a person dies in Bundoran, the coroner could insist that the body be brought to Letterkenny instead of Sligo.  In the Dundalk area the coroner could insist on a body being brought to Monaghan, causing great <Col N="1847" /> inconvenience to relatives.  If an ambulance is required to remove a dead body it cannot remove it to a hospital outside the area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister review the Coroners Act in consultation with the health boards, the local authorities and the coroners association in order to address these problems?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary legislation in relation to coroners is contained in the Coroners Act, 1962 for which the Minister for Justice has responsibility. This Act contains detailed provisions in relation to the office of coroner, coroners' districts, salaries of coroners etc., as well as provisions governing the holding of inquests, holding of post-mortems etc.</P>
      <P>In addition to responsibilities set out in the Act which devolve on the Minister for Justice, local authorities have a role in relation to coroners, as also do certain hospitals in each coroner's district. Specifically, the local authorities employ and pay the salaries of coroners and they provide the coroners with such supplies of stationery and prescribed forms as they may reasonably require in the discharge of their duties.  The coroners, in the course of having post-mortems and special examinations carried out, have to rely on the mortuary facilities in hospitals.  It is evident, therefore, that each coroner is dependent on the availability of such facilities from the hospitals in that coroner's district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is empowered under the Act, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, to fix by means of a statutory order the various fees to be paid to persons performing or assisting at post-mortems, as well as the expenses payable in connection with removal or custody, in accordance with the directions of a coroner, of a body and, finally, the expenses payable to witnesses at inquests.  The current levels of these fees and expenses are set out in the regulations made in 1990.  The fees and expenses are paid on foot of a coroner's certificate by the local authority by whom <Col N="1848" /> the coroner conducting the inquest was appointed.  As there is a formal statutory mechanism governing the payment of such claims, the Deputy will appreciate that the various local authorities must apply the specific terms of the regulations. In consequence, a local authority would not have authority to deviate from the regulations in order to pay fees or expenses over and above the levels specified. However, increases have been sought, on behalf of hospital consultants, in certain of the fees in the 1990 regulations and this matter is being examined in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I am aware that difficulties can arise from time to time for coroners in having post-mortems performed and the attention of the Department of Justice has been called on occasion to inadequate mortuary and post-mortem facilities. Specific issues in relation to facilities in hospital for performance of post-mortems have been taken up, as the occasion arises, with the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>As it has become evident that the facilities available to coroners for post-mortems and special examinations are in some instances not all they should be and having regard to the claims for improvements in the levels of fees and expenses payable, the Department of Justice is engaging in discussions about these matters with the Departments of the Environment and Health.</P>
    <P>I would be most anxious to ensure that the conducting of post-mortems by a coroner should not occasion any undue distress for the relatives of the deceased person and that every possible step to reduce delays or difficulties in arranging post-mortems examinations should be taken.  The points raised by Deputy O'Hanlon will be borne in mind in the context of the forthcoming discussions between the three Departments involved in the matter of facilities for coroners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the serious traffic problems in Dublin and the inadequate administrative arrangements to deal with them.  Traffic <Col N="1849" /> problems in Dublin are acute and worsening.  The Government established the Dublin Transportation Initiative to examine this matter.  Its final report was expected last October but it has not yet been published.  Many decisions are being put on the long finger.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation Traffic Committee under my chairmanship drew up a comprehensive traffic management policy plan for a 12 month period and finally adopted it a year ago.  This plan requested the Government to make several administrative and legislative changes. Decisions on those many proposals have been delayed by the Government pending the finalisation of the report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which has also been delayed following the decrease in the allocation of Cohesion Funds from more than £8 billion to less than £7 billion.  The administrative and legislative changes which I call for do not require the allocation of Cohesion Funds.</P>
      <P>We all agree that traffic law enforcement in Dublin is wholly inadequate. Responsibility for this rests with the Garda who inevitably give traffic law enforcement a lower priority than the prevention and fighting of crime.  A measure of this position is evident in that only 23 per cent of all traffic fines imposed are collected.  Half the summonses issued are never served and fewer than half those served are brought to a successful conclusion.  As a result a great many drivers ignore traffic laws and, consequently, Dublin is choked with traffic. The inadequate provisions are possibly costing the State in income for fines and parking foregone as much as £20 million per annum which would pay several times over for the 300 traffic police corps I propose for Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time of high unemployment it would make sense to create 300 jobs, especially when the public finances would be a net beneficiary.  There are additional advantages.  It would release gardaí from traffic duties and allow them more time to fight crime and improve the economic environment for job creation in Dublin. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce stated that traffic congestion is doing <Col N="1850" /> more to withhold investment than the imposition of taxes.  The problem is that a single person or body is not in charge of Dublin traffic.  The corporation and the county councils are responsible for traffic management implementation but the Garda Commissioner is the traffic authority responsible for the enforcement of traffic regulations.  The Department of Justice is responsible for traffic wardens, unlike other local authorities who have retained that function.  The Department of the Environment is the ultimate road and road traffic management authority and the transport authority has responsibility for transport. There is no co-ordinated traffic management system in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A five point plan is urgently needed for Dublin City.  Dublin Corporation should replace the Garda Commissioner as the traffic authority to merge traffic management with traffic enforcement regulations. A special 300 man traffic police corps should be established under Dublin Corporation which would have responsibility for the traffic warden service. Responsibility for tow-away services, now the responsibility of the Garda, should be transferred back to the corporation and privatised and the inner city should be divided into three contract areas.  Provision should be made for an increase in the number of multi-storey car parks in the inner city by means of joint venture between Dublin Corporation and the commercial sector and there should be a parallel reduction in the number of on-street parking places. All the administrative and legislative changes requested by the traffic committee of Dublin Corporation should be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread feeling among Dubliners that Dublin did not get its fair share of European funds.  It would be wrong if key transport issues, such as the port access route and a light rail system interconnecting with the DART, were cancelled or deferred because of the Government's mishandling of the Cohesion Funds.  There is no excuse for further delay in acceding to the corporation's request for urgent administrative <Col N="1851" /> and legislative changes to the congested traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Road traffic legislation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment. The role of the Minister for Justice is to ensure that road traffic law is enforced to ensure that the Garda have adequate resources to fulfil their responsibilities in the enforcement area.</P>
      <P>Regarding the enforcement of road traffic legislation, I will give a broad outline of the role of the Garda Commissioner in this area.</P>
      <P>I note Deputy Mitchell refers to the need for special traffic police.  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that in the Dublin metropolitan area there is a specific Garda traffic corps which comprises a chief superintendent, one superintendent, three inspectors, seven sargeants and 75 gardaí.  This amounts to a total of 87 members of the force whose main function is to enforce the traffic laws in the city and its environs.  I do not know what precisely the Deputy proposes when he suggests setting up a special traffic police service.  Such a service is already in place and has a very good record in achieving its aims.  The Minister for Justice is committed to ensuring that this corps has the most up-to-date and sophisticated equipment, manpower and necessary transport to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has responsibility for the appointment of traffic wardens in the Dublin Metropolitan Area under section 64 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968.  At present there is a total of 57 full-time and 123 part-time wardens. They are primarily concerned with the issue of on-the-spot notices for illegally parked vehicles.  Receipts from on-the-spot parking fines in 1993 for such illegal parking amounted to £3,263,000.  Those enforcement measures represent a significant effort by the gardaí and traffic wardens to address the problem of illegal parking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> The Garda have acquired seven state of the art two trucks which enables the service to operate on a 24 hour day basis removing illegally and dangerously parked vehicles.  The Garda maintains a car pound to which these vehicles are taken.  Since January 1990, owners of towed-away vehicles are subject to the charges on retrieval from the car pound; namely a removal fee of £75 and a storage fee of £25 per day or part of a day.  Since 1990, almost 27,000 illegally and badly parked vehicles have been towed away by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with enforcement issues relating to traffic problems in Dublin and it is clear the Garda are very active in this regard.  However, the matter does not stop there.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that other Ministers and agencies play a substantial role in this area.  For example, the Dublin Transportation Initiative is examining and addressing all aspects of transport related problems in the city.  The Government is committed to improving the public transport infrastructure in the city by spending large sums of European Structural Funds on the provision of rapid transport systems. A major programme of road construction is well under way which has as one of its central objectives the relief of traffic bottle-necks.</P>
    <P>The Government is active on this front which is more than can be said for the period when the Deputy's party was in power when the resources provided for public transport, the road network, and for Garda enforcement, were totally insufficient.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue of the crisis faced by the National Theatre and its future funding and I thank the Minister for coming in to reply.  I raise the position of the Abbey Theatre and its future funding because I am concerned that this <Col N="1853" /> flagship national institution, central to the revival of our culture, which has put Irish playwrights on the world map appears, once again, to be in crisis.  All its staff are on protective notice.  There is a deteriorating financial situation, the Abbey is in a difficult position and has to adapt to a changed artistic and economic environment.  The National Theatre, which has been a centre of excellence with the highest possible standards, a driving agent for change in our society with O'Casey's plays, a platform of talent for Shaw and others aimed at getting and keeping a populace audience, not only an élite one, is facing a major challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister state his proposals for the Abbey?  There appears to be confusion, antagonism and difficult discussions between the Arts Council and the Abbey Theatre and I am concerned about the consequences.  In November 1993 I raised with the Minister the future funding of the Abbey Theatre, it appeared at that time he was planning to change the funding arrangements.  I asked him also where the responsibility for funding and management would lie, the implications for the Arts Council and to make a statement on the matter.  Then, eight months ago, the Minister said he was considering whether it would be appropriate to move the responsibility for funding the Abbey Theatre from the Arts Council, where it has been since 1976, back to his Department.  Has the Minister made a decision on that, and has he arrived at an agreement with the Abbey and the Arts Council?  He also said that under that arrangement he would expect the Arts Council to remain involved in the ongoing appraisal of the Abbey's future funding needs.  How does the Minister see that happening?  At the moment, there seems to be a real problem. The Abbey is trying to serve two masters, the Minister, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and the Arts Council.  Uncertainty reigns.  There is a sense in which the funding is with the Arts Council but is not with the Arts <Col N="1854" /> Council.  This whole saga must be deeply unsettling to other national institutions. The Minister appears to have allowed a deeply uncertain situation to develop which is undermining the Arts Council and not helping the Abbey.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed concern about bringing the Abbey Theatre into a more direct relationship with the Department. It raises the prospect of probably one of the most profound changes in the funding of the arts for almost 20 years.  I have a number of questions and look forward to the Minister's reply to them.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's assessment of the problems facing the theatre at the moment?  What are the solutions and what is the correct method of funding the Abbey?  Does the Minister, for example, approve of the yardstick being used by the Arts Council to determine the grant to the Abbey, that is, that it should attempt to get between 70 and 75 per cent attendance?  Does the Minister believe that is a reasonable requirement? These are serious questions as the Abbey gets more money than all other theatre activities in the country.  I would immediately add, however, that, like the Minister, I share the view of the importance of a National Theatre reaching the highest standards.  That, of course, costs money.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister happy with the structures in place at the Abbey or, arising out of the suggested change in the funding, has he decided that this is the only issue to be tackled?  In tackling that, is he saying there is nothing wrong with any of the other structures within the Abbey at present?  I note that Mr. Patrick Mason, the artistic director of the National Theatre, said when he took over the post in January that the troubled times of the theatre were now fortunately lodged in the past.  This does not appear to be the case.  However, I congratulate him and others on the efforts they are clearly making to get the finances into shape and begin to move ahead in the way in which he wishes.  This would be greatly helped if the Minister would clarify his own <Col N="1855" /> intentions in the matter.  I am concerned because confusion reigns about the Minister's future plans for the funding of this theatre and it is a deeply unsettling time for the Abbey.  It is time we had precision and less aspirational talk about hypothetical possibilities.  It is important that confidence be restored on this issue, both in the Arts Council and in the Abbey Theatre.</P>

The discussions taking place in the National Theatre are a matter for the National Theatre Company, the management and the unions and this is an area in which I have no function.  I am sure the Deputy, like me, would want to behave in such a way as would only assist the resolution of those trade union and management difficulties.</P>
      <P>Let me take up the points raised by the Deputy.  She is, perhaps more than anybody, aware that the proposals which I circulated are for the future funding of the Abbey.  To suggest that any proposals of mine are responsible for present uncertainty or uncertainty based on past performance is singularly inaccurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Owen will allow me, I will be delighted to answer her colleague's questions.  As to the future funding of the Abbey Theatre, I have already indicated to the House on a number of occasions that the Abbey, as Ireland's National Theatre, is the primary cultural agency for the promotion of theatre and the work of Irish playwrights. Since 1976 the Abbey has been funded by An Comhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council.  Prior to this, the theatre was funded directly by the State through the Vote of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> However, having regard to the importance of the Abbey and the status of national cultural institutions, I indicated on 4 November 1993, in reply to a parliamentary question, that I was considering whether it would be more appropriate in current circumstances to fund the theatre directly through my Department's Vote in the same way as other national institutions such as the National Concert Hall or the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  Under such an arrangement I would expect An Chomhairle Ealaíon to remain involved in the ongoing appraisal of the Abbey's funding needs and to have new functions in the appraisal of the funding needs of the National Concert Hall and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The intention would be that An Comhairle Ealaíon would make representations to me on the funding requirements of these three cultural institutions, after which I would come to a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>Since replying to the parliamentary question on 4 November 1993 I have had consultations with the chairpersons and directors of An Comhairle Ealaíon, the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Abbey Theatre. The sole intention behind my proposals was to establish new coherent and transparent structures which would stand the test of time and facilitate the securing of additional resources for all four institutions. These proposals were explained at the meeting which the directors and chairpersons attended.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to put new structures in place which will underline the principle of autonomy with responsibility by ensuring transparency and an appropriate degree of accountability in these new structures.  My proposals were not designed to introduce structures which would be overburdening or over-bureaucratic. They represented a genuine attempt on my part to address the needs of these institutions more effectively. However, in the consultations with all four institutions I made it clear to them <Col N="1857" /> that if the structures I was proposing were not, in their opinion, the optimum structures for future progress, I would welcome and expect concrete suggestions from them on what alternative proposals they would recommend to bring about my stated objectives for these institutions.</P>
    <P>The position on the future funding of the Abbey is as I have outlined, and I am awaiting the detailed view of An Comhairle Ealaíon, the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Abbey.  I expect to obtain these views in the near future and I hope to be in a position to make a final decision on this subject soon afterwards.  There will be no undue delay.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered most of the points raised by Deputy Fitzgerald.  I always appreciate and acknowledge her concern in matters relating to the arts in general and the Abbey Theatre in particular. I suggest, however, that what is important at this stage is that the procedures over which we have no direct control, which are ones of an industrial relations kind, can come to a happy resolution but also that plans for the future will be based on consultation and meet the needs of this most important cultural institution.  I have appreciated the work that has been put in so far in response to the invitations I made for consultation in this matter.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Special Assessment of Dyslexic Students.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education, or at least a Minister from her Department, is not here as this is a matter of extreme urgency because of the nature of the complaint I have to make.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in the treatment by her Department of applications by dyslexic students for assistance during their leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, applications for assistance are made to the Department <Col N="1858" /> of Education either early in the year of the examination or late in the previous year, and an assessor is sent from the Department to decide how much assistance the student requires.  This year I have received a number of complaints about refusals by the Department to give any assistance whatsoever either by way of a special invigilator, an amanuensis or a specialist corrector of the examination papers.</P>
    <P>Students with dyslexia &mdash; sometimes they are referred to as students with specific learning difficulties &mdash; show some learning skills developed to an above average or average standard but also show organising or learning difficulties which limit the development of their curriculum skills in some or all of speech, reading, spelling, writing, numeracy and behaviour.</P>
    <P>This variety of difficulties in learning leads to a special education need for many students.  It is essential that the Department distinguishes between the slow learner child, for whom all components of learning are weak and all the routes to learning are difficult, and others for whom one or two specific routes to learning are impaired.  Children who are unable to use many of the major components of learning to the full could and must be taught to do so.</P>
    <P>In the approach to meeting the special education needs of children who learn differently and who, because of specific limitations in their learning skills, fail to acquire adequate skills in reading, writing, spelling and numeracy, we must consider the question as put by a well-known specialist in dyslexia, Harry Chasty: if this child does not learn the way we teach, can we teach him-her the way he-she learns?  Can we then go on to extend and develop their competence in learning, so giving them more effective access to language literacy and their curriculum?</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the case of one young student from a school in north Dublin who was allowed <Col N="1859" /> specialist correction facilities on her junior certificate papers but has been refused a similar facility for her leaving certificate. This girl is highly intelligent and has ambitions to go on to third level. However, the Department's refusal only three days ago has created great tension in these crucial weeks before her examination. There should be absolutely no difficulty in providing similar facilities for this young girl as were provided in her junior certificate examination.  Her dyslexic condition has not changed and there should be no need for a reassessment.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, told me of the case of a young man in a Sligo school who has been refused a special invigilator for his leaving certificate. This young man has a very high IQ in some areas but, sadly, in reading he has a much lower IQ.  He is distressed by this refusal and his parents are deeply concerned that his ability to do well in his leaving certificate is being affected by the Department's refusal.  I have details of that young man if the Minister wishes to have them.  These are not isolated cases.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Minister's announcement today that additional grant aid will be made available for special categories of education. However, there are students in our general second level schools who are being treated in a discriminatory fashion.  They are suffering during the current examinations and, if the Department does not change the manner in which it deals with applications for assistance by dyslexic students, they will suffer in being unable to fulfil their ambitions towards further education.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to ask the Minister for Education to review this practice in her Department and to consider the specific case I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given the opportunity of outlining the Department of Education's position regarding the case referred to by Deputy Owen of a girl who is sitting for her leaving certificate examination this year and on whose <Col N="1860" /> behalf Marino College, Fairview, Dublin 3, has applied for special consideration in her forthcoming examinations on the grounds that she is impaired by a specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Department has operated a scheme of special consideration for many years in the case of candidates who have disabilities.  The scheme is intended for candidates who have learnt the knowledge to be examined but who would be impaired in communicating it to an examiner because of a physical or psycholigical disability.</P>
      <P>It should be explained that special consideration does not mean more lenient marking.  The Department of Education's aim is to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and to enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment.  A range of facilities is available and these are tailored, as far as possible, to the needs of the individual candidates.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to specific learning difficulty is that all applications for special consideration based on the existence of this condition are referred to the psychological service of the Department. Special consideration is approved where the Department's psychologists are satisfied that the condition is of such a degree that the candidate would be impaired in reading the questions or in writing the answers.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, when I put down my question I did not make available for public consumption the name of the student and the college concerned as I did not have the parents' permission to do so.  I am surprised the Minister has referred to this specific case. I would appreciate, in the event of it being covered by the media, if they would be conscious of the fact that I did not mention the student's name.  Since I did not include the name in the question &mdash; I said the details were supplied &mdash; it is unusual to refer to it in the reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Special consideration is approved where the Department's psychologists are satisfied that the condition is of such a degree that the candidate would be impaired in reading the questions or in writing the answers.  It is also approved where the examiner would have difficulty in deciphering the candidate's handwriting.  A wide range of facilities is available in the case of a pupil who is impaired.  A candidate who is unable to read, or is effectively unable to read, may be allowed the service of a person who will read the questions.  A candidate who is unable to write, or is effectively unable to write, may be allowed the service of a scribe or the use of a mechanical aid such as a tape recorder, a typewriter or a word processor. Extra time may be allowed where the candidate is unable to make adequate use of the services or aids allowed.</P>
      <P>The facility which is afforded the majority of candidates who are impaired by a specific learning difficulty is, however, simply to ensure that their answerbooks are marked by examiners who are experienced in marking the work of such candidates and in deciphering their handwriting.  These examiners will ensure that full credit is given for all work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for special consideration on the grounds of a special <Col N="1862" /> learning difficulty was made to the Department late last year in the case to which Deputy Owen referred.  Samples of the student's written work and a tape of her responses to selected questions from previous English examination papers accompanied the application.  The Department's psychologist considered the psychological report which was submitted when the student sat for her intermediate certificate examination in 1991 and the samples of the written work now submitted.  She noted that the samples were very legible and that the contents were clear and well structured.  It is the opinion of the Department's psychologist that the student's written work has improved considerably since she sat for her intermediate certificate examination. She has concluded that a regular examiner would not have difficulty reading her work and has expressed the opinion that in the circumstances special consideration is not warranted.</P>
    <P>As already stated, special consideration often consists of simply passing a candidate's scripts to an examiner who is used to deciphering poor handwriting. As there was no need even for this, in the opinion of the Department's phychologist, the school was informed on 5 May that the Department was not prepared to grant special consideration in this case.</P>
    <P>I should add that the existence of a special learning difficulty does not automatically qualify a candidate for special consideration in examinations.  Even though candidates may have a specific difficulty with reading, writing or spelling they may not require the provision of any special facilities provided they can read the question papers of the required level and write legibly and intelligibly.  Each individual case is considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>I apologise for the Minister for Education who is unavoidably absent, as is the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  As Deputy Owen has <Col N="1863" /> requested, I will contact the Minister about this matter tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister the details of the other case I mentioned.

I do not know whether this script has been extensively circulated.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 May 1994.</P>

    <P>In 1993, nominations were made to two State boards under the aegis of my Department: the Irish Aid Advisory Committee and the Refugee Agency. Nominations to these boards took into account the Commissions' recommendations and the relevant Government decisions on gender balance.</P>
    <P>As regards the use of non-sexist forms, the various forms in use in the Department of Foreign Affairs were already in line with the commission's recommendation. It has been standard procedure in this Department to follow non-sexist practices in correspondence since the publication in 1985 of the Government's White Paper on the Public Service entitled &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo;.

However, I would like to assure the Deputy that, when examining proposals and making recommendations on decisions to be taken in any areas which <Col N="1817" /> would have an equality dimension, my Department has full regard to the equal opportunity policy and guidelines for the Civil Service, to relevant Government decisions in this area and to Government policy on equality as set out in the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>My Department has a controlling responsibility for the operation of voluntary early retirement/severance schemes in those areas of the public sector which are funded by the Exchequer, and a monitoring role in relation to similar schemes in other public sector areas, e.g. commercial State bodies.  I am not aware of any general impediment &mdash; statutory or otherwise &mdash; which prevents the application of such schemes to employees under 40 years of age.  In fact, the voluntary early retirement/severance schemes which applied in the Civil Service and certain other public service bodies in the period 1987-88 operated without any age restriction in the case of staff who were surplus to operational requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, certain commercial State bodies have also operated voluntary early retirement/severance schemes for their staff.  The terms of these schemes have not always been identical to those of the 1987-88 public service model &mdash; for example, they have in some cases differentiated between younger staff, who were offered immediate severance payments plus preserved superannuation benefits payable at normal retirement age, and older staff who were offered immediate superannuation benefits. In monitoring the schemes operated by State bodies, my Department's primary concern is to ensure that the overall cost of the individual schemes is not excessive.  Subject to that general proviso, the State bodies concerned have been in a position to devise compensation packages tailored to meet their particular needs and circumstances, including differentiation on the basis of age or length <Col N="1819" /> of service.  Accordingly, my Department has not imposed any central restrictions as regards the age of participation in the State body schemes, and has no plans to do so.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the European Union NOW programme will continue to operate in the period 1994-99.  On 16 February, the European Commission agreed its approach on the Community Initiatives to be supported in the period to 1999. Draft guidelines for a series of individual initiatives, including the Employment and Development of Human Resources Initiative, have been adopted by the European Commission.  One of the elements of this Initiative will be known as employment-NOW and will represent a continuation and deepening of the existing NOW Initiative.</P>

      <P>Equality proofing involves the assessment of the differential impact which a decision may have on women or on disadvantaged groups.  All decisions I take have appropriate regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>For example, on the specific issue of gender balance in the composition of board membership I refer the Deputy to the recently established city and county enterprise boards.  There are 35 city and county enterprise boards in operation throughout the State.  Membership of the boards was drawn from panels of elected members of local authorities and from representatives of the social partners, State agencies and local business and community interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the initial nomination procedure failed to secure a satisfactory gender balance <Col N="1824" /> in board membership, I took positive remedial action to counteract the scarcity of women members.  A wider canvass was undertaken to encourage women with business experience to participate in the work of the boards.  This action redressed the imbalance and will help, in my view, to tap the significant potential of local employment initiatives for women and build on the success of the community-based projects under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the European Union NOW Initiative.</P>
    <P>The boards were recently reminded by my Department that the Government stipulation regarding the achievement of gender balance in the composition of board membership must be borne in mind in considering nominations to replace members on resignation or in the exercise of co-options.</P>

      <P>The report of the Scientific Sea Trout Working Group for 1993 published in February last and the final report of the Sea Trout Task Force published in March address the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Scientific Sea Trout Working Group report for 1993 stated that preliminary analyses had revealed a statistical relationship between lice infestation parameters and distance from salmon farms.  Further analysis of available data has pointed to stronger indications of such a relationship.  Further scientific work is being carried out on this and other hypotheses about the actual role of sea lice in sea trout declines.  All the findings will be forwarded, in the first instance, for consideration by the successor monitoring group to the Sea Trout Task Force which will be convened shortly.</P>
      <P>The Sea Trout Task Force in its final report considered the findings of scientific investigations to date and noted that it is extremely rare for scientific investigation to lead to findings of 100 per cent certainty: a high degree of probability is usually the most that can be realised.  The task force report concluded that the research points to infestation by sea lice in the vicinity of sea farms as the factor most closely associated with the marked incidence of adverse pressure on sea trout stocks in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that sea lice from salmon farms may have contributed to sea trout declines in certain areas, every possible step is being taken to minimise their numbers. The Department's 1994 action programme to conserve, protect and rehabilitate sea trout stocks has been augmented to give full effect to the additional measures recommended by the task force.  Under this programme a revised and more comprehensive monitoring and control programme, as recommended by the task force, to minimise sea lice levels on salmon farms is in place.  Ongoing <Col N="1828" /> results from lice monitoring programmes to date show that lice levels are being controlled at very low levels.  In addition quantification of sea trout stocks, conservation measures and a major programme of rehabilitation are key components of the action programme.</P>
    <P>While the need for continued research on all aspects of the sea trout problem is acknowledged and the national research programme continues under the aegis of the scientific working group, the first and most immediate priority is the practical framework for action recommended by the task force, notably to ensure the effectiveness of measures to control sea lice levels.  That agreed action plan is being fully implemented by the Department.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to milk quota sold by the suppliers concerned to their milk purchaser for re-allocation to other suppliers under a milk quota restructuring scheme.  Such schemes in Ireland <Col N="1830" /> are operated at the level of the milk purchaser. Consequently any quota which is sold by outgoing suppliers attached to a particular milk purchaser is re-allocated to that purchaser's other milk suppliers. The re-allocation, however, is made in accordance with predetermined priorities with, for example, top priority being given to suppliers with quotas from zero to 30,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>The surrender quota to which the Deputy refers would, therefore, be available for re-allocation to eligible suppliers, according to priority, attached to that purchaser irrespective of their location. Apart from deciding the priority rules and enforcing their proper application, my Department or I have no role in the re-allocation of such surrendered quota.</P>

      <P>The two enterprises in question were farmed jointly as a single holding in 1992 and 1993.  Under the EU arable area payments scheme applicants claiming aid on excess of 15.13 hectares of eligible crops are obliged to set-aside 15 per cent of their area.  Under EU rules no payments can be made as the area on which both claims were made was in excess of 15.13 hectares and no land was set-aside.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under the EU regulations only one application is permitted for land which was operated as a single holding, irrespective of its tenancy status, prior to 30 June 1992.  However, where two or more applications are submitted under the arable area simplified scheme in respect of a single holding, the EU will allow payment as an exception in 1993 on these claims if the total area of all the claims is below the threshold for the simplified scheme (i.e. less than 15.13 hectares).  This was not the case with the two claims in question.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht only some 16 months ago, I have, with the full co-operation of my colleagues in Government, already put in place an integrated package of policy measures to promote the Irish film and television production industry.  As I have already indicated in a reply to parliamentary questions tabled by Deputies Peadar Clohessy and Liz O'Donnell on 14 April last, these measures include the <Col N="1838" /> re-establishment of Bord Scannán na hÉireann; the enactment of broadcasting legislation to link RTE commissionings with the independent production sector; the decision to establish a new television service, Teilifís na Gaeilge; significant additional tax incentives including a specific provision aimed at indigenous low budget film projects in the Finance Bill, 1994; continued support by An Comhairle Ealaíon for film organisations and Film and Video Awards; support for Údarás na Gaeltachta for the establishment of audiovisual production companies in the Gaeltacht; participation in the EU MEDIA Programme; and funding by the Government towards EURIMAGES, the Council of Europe's film fund.</P>
      <P>Given this integrated package of policy initiatives, I would suggest to the Deputy that the scope for further proposals for the development of our film industry has been correspondingly reduced. However, the Deputy can rest assured that I remain open to pursue further initiatives to remove any remaining obstacles to the full development of a vibrant and sustainable film and television production industry in this country. To this end, I have established a new committee, named STATCOM, comprising senior officials of the State agencies dealing with the industry and my own Department.  STATCOM have identified a number of issues requiring possible further attention by the State sector, including the unmet training requirements of the industry; the need or otherwise for a national film commission to promote Ireland as a location for film making; the need for more extensive post-production facilities in the State; banking facilities, and film distribution structures.  STATCOM has already begun to assess the unmet training requirements of the industry, and this exercise will be completed by end-September.  STATECOM is the forum which will advise me over time as to whether further initiatives are required and I will give careful consideration to any proposals which the committee may put forward on this subject.</P>

      <P>As of 31 December 1993, there were a total of 83 children on the in-patient waiting list for ophthalmology procedures in the Dublin area.  As a direct result of the Government's £20 million waiting list initiative last year, the number of children waiting over six months at June, 1993 was reduced from 334 to 42 at December 1993, a reduction of 87 per cent.

      <P>The Government is anxious to build on the success of the 1993 initiative.

      <P>I am anxious that every effort be made to inform and educate young people regarding the dangers of drugs and alcohol abuse.  Materials on drugs and alcohol are available to all schools through our health promotion unit's public office.  I am satisfied that the range of materials on the issue is comprehensive.</P>
      <P>However, educating young people about the dangers associated with drug and alcohol abuse is not just about the giving of information but also about giving young people the opportunity to develop and practise the skills necessary to resist pressures to use various substances of abuse.</P>
      <P>This is what has motivated the development of our drink awareness for youth programme which is used extensively in schools at the moment.  Another of our resources, solvent abuse resource materials, is also available to schools.</P>
      <P>In addressing the issue of substance abuse generally it is also important that a multi-sectoral approach is adopted.  A substance abuse prevention programme, developed jointly by the health promotion unit and the Department of Education, in conjunction with Mater Dei Counselling Centre, will be launched in second level schools next September.  A programme for parents, &ldquo;Alcohol, Drugs &amp; Family Communication&rdquo; being piloted in the Southern Health Board in conjunction with the health promotion unit assists parents to deal with problems which emerge in adolescence in relation to alcohol and drug use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 15-22 October, Ireland will take part in European Drug Prevention Week.  The focus of this week is prevention of drug abuse, including alcohol abuse among young people.  The health promotion unit co-ordinates preparations <Col N="1842" /> for the week and it is hoped that a greater awareness of all the issues relating to drug abuse will be created among young people.  This will be reinforced by messages on national and local media.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I consider drug and alcohol abuse prevention among young people as a priority area for attention.  The forthcoming substance abuse prevention programme will be a useful addition to school-based resources and my Department will continue to address the problem by a range of initiatives allowing the non-formal education sector, parents and the wider community to support school-based activities.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the concern of persons (details supplied) in Dublin 15, if she will clarify the position in relation to the catchment area of the new second level school for the Castleknock area, Dublin 15; and whether children in the Portersgate and Clonsilla Village areas and pupils at St. Mochta's national school will be included in the catchment area, as is their wish.</Quest>

      <P>In general, catchment areas are defined by assigning identified national schools to a particular post-primary centre.  However, in major urban and suburban areas, such as Castleknock, there are no clearly defined catchment areas &mdash; pupils in these areas are not specifically confined to any particular school catchment area.</P>
      <P>The consultants' study which led to the recent decision to provide a new post-primary school in Diswellstown, Castleknock, had regard to the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that an adequate number of pupil places will be available to meet the expected demands on the new school.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is recognised by my Department as a school serving a disadvantaged area and, as such, has an additional concessionary teaching post and receives additional capitation funding at the rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
      <P>As stated in my recent announcement on the 1994 Education budget, I propose to allocate fifteen additional co-ordinator posts to the home school community liaison service at primary level with effect from September next.</P>
      <P>These extra posts will facilitate a significant expansion of the service and the schools to be targeted will be selected from among those already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The process of selecting schools for inclusion in the expanded home school community liaison service is currently under way in my Department and the needs of the school in question will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>Plans for the establishment of a preschool programme are well advanced in my Department and a decision on the areas selected for inclusion will be taken shortly.</P>
      <P>The initial phase of the programme will involve the establishment of eight preschool projects.  It is my intention that these projects will be located in areas of particular disadvantage and that they will make use of a developmental approach to the needs of very young children, with qualified teachers, and the active co-operation of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of this initial phase of the programme will be closely monitored to ensure that it provides an effective <Col N="1845" /> basis for further development in this area in future years.</P>
