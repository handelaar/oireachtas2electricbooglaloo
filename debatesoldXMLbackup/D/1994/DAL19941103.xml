      <P>Item No. 3 refers to three Bills, two of which have not received any consideration on Committee Stage, and requires the Select Committee to report back to the Dáil by 28 November.  Committee Members on <Col N="1706" /> this side of the House feel that this timeframe may be too short for these Bills to be considered properly and fully.  May I suggest an extension of a week on the 28 November deadline, by agreement?</P>

      <P>In regard to the Casual Trading Bill and the Competition (Amendment) Bill no amendment has yet been reached on these substantial Bills to which a considerable number of amendments has been tabled.  These Bills were not taken by the Committee during the summer and I find it hard to understand the sudden urgency.  In regard to the Consumer Credit Bill, great progress has been made but we await a Government decision on some <Col N="1707" /> elements and this is holding up progress.</P>

While I did not introduce the amendment I moved here last week, because the Whips meeting has not yet taken place, regarding legitimate interventions with the consent of the speaker in possession I want the Government Whip to understand that I will be dealing with this issue again subsequent to our Whips meeting when I hope we can arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government stated that the Government would establish a national education and certification board to <Col N="1708" /> give Irish students and trainees awards that would be recognised internationally. It stated that legislation would be required but that pending the legislation an interim board would be established.  My understanding is that legislation has not been introduced and the interim board, promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government, has not been put in place either.  In view of the fact that it is important that training qualifications here should be recognised &mdash; I understand some dispute between Departments is holding it up &mdash; I ask the Taoiseach when this board will be established and the legislation promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government will be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister who are in dispute are members of the same party, so we cannot claim that this is a split in the coalition.  I ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Breathnach, to come to a decision.  Government is about making decisions.  I ask them to make a decision because there are Irish trainees whose qualifications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  First, in 1992 the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications introduced a ministerial policy directive in regard to competitive tendering for State bodies. In view of the confusion in the public mind surrounding the sale of a CIE shunt yard in Cork is it proposed to introduce any amendments to that directive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The second matter I wish to raise is the fact that the Whips agreed that the electoral Bill would be debated in the House this week.  A portion of that electoral Bill concerns the setting up, on a statutory basis, of a commission to examine constituency revisions.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House the reason the Minister for the Environment announced this commission on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis yesterday evening thus pre-empting any discussion in the House and showing gross disrespect for all the elected Members who may have strong views on this issue with a view to the possibility of changing the terms of reference or whatever?  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet are adamant that the Government will last for two years what was the reason for the rush in announcing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Heritage Council Bill is important but, unfortunately, because of commitments to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I will be unable to address some issues in great detail.</P>
      <P>When we talk about heritage it is important to bear in mind that it is not simply a question of bequeathing without question what we inherit from the past.  As reflected in the need to establish the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, much of our history is taken without question and delivered to us in an unquestioning manner.  While I acknowledge that this Bill is not directly concerned with the teaching of history, that aspect of our heritage should be the subject of much questioning and must be dealt with in our schools and other fora in a manner which ensures that children and adults are conscious of the fact that there is more than one interpretation of history and heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heritage centres tend to deliver a bland blancmange style interpretation of the past and the Office of Public Works tends to be the worst offender in delivering that type of interpretation in their interpretative centres.  We must <Col N="1715" /> ensure that alternative views are provided through those centres.  In interpreting history one must be careful that all aspects are taken into account and it is not done in such a way that gives credence to one political view.</P>
    <P>A major ongoing debate in history relates to revisionism.  Revisionists tends to be accused of many things.  It is implied that they distort history, whereas by and large they attempt to reinterpret it in a new way, apart from what might be regarded as the official interpretation.  That debate will continue and the longer it goes on the better, provided it is carried on with a degree of honesty.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is conscious of the commercialisation of heritage which inevitably will lead to a blancmange type heritage presentation.  The need to present a happy-go-lucky image of the Irish, the storytellers, men and women without any cares and so on, is important for the tourism trade, but it would be more useful if we presented ourselves warts and all, as opposed to a green, shamrock type presentation.</P>
    <P>At a time when reconciliation on this island is paramount, it is salutary to reflect that last year Sir Edward Carson's birthplace was under threat of demolition.  It was saved only be a concerted effort mounted by An Taisce and concerned individuals.  This Bill would have done nothing to protect that building, nor would it have protected the thousands of buildings which have fallen victim to neglect, commercial demolition or architectural vandalism over the past three decades.  While the Minister indicated that he intends to deal with this problem in a separate Bill, the matter should have been dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The threat to Edward Carson's birthplace made the news, but what about all the other buildings under threat in Dublin and elsewhere, for example, St. Helen's House in Booterstown, the historic church of St. Michael and St. John in Temple Bar which may be gutted to <Col N="1716" /> make way for yet another heritage centre, and the EU-funded Viking Centre project?  Our heritage is being sacrificed in the interests of erecting so called heritage centres, a misnomer in the way they are organised.</P>
    <P>In the unequal battle between the needs of our heritage and the demands of developers, heritage loses out every time and will continue to lose out following the enactment of this legislation. The Bill is a perfect example of the quangoism which has pervaded the Government since it entered office.  At first glance the powers of the council appear impressive, especially in relation to sites owned by a public authority. Section 10 (3) states that where the council has advised against a proposal, the public authority shall not commence work on the proposal,</P>
    <P>...unless</P>
    <P> (a)  the Minister agrees to the proposal, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister agrees to a modified form of the proposal, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the Government agrees to the proposal. </P>
    <P>Once again, the fate of Ireland's environment, particularly our built environment is being left in the uncertain hands of Ministers who can change from time to time and, indeed, whose views may change from time to time.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious deficiencies of the Bill is the explicit prohibition on the council holding land.  This means the council cannot purchase land or buildings under threat.  What can the council do under the terms of the Bill?  In essence, it can make recommendations, but when one considers the volume of recommendations from statutory and voluntary bodies buried in the dust on successive Ministers' shelves, that power is less than impressive.  In the final analysis the Heritage Council will be able to delay but not prevent destruction.  The built environment has <Col N="1717" /> been ill-served by successive Governments. The scant legislation in existence remains largely unimplemented.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Oireachtas passed the Derelict Sites Act which provided for stiff penalties to be levied on the owners of derelict sites.  Derelict sites can be acquired compulsorily by a local authority and owners in contravention of the provisions of the Act are subjected to fines of up to £25,000 or, in one case, £2,000 for every day during which they are in contravention of those provisions. This is precisely the kind of draconian legislation needed to preserve what remains of our towns and cities. However, a quick drive through the streets of Dublin, Cork or Limerick will confirm the non-implementation of the provisions of this Act, as derelict sites deface many areas.  Dublin's quays are, or were, lined with 17th and 18th century buildings, many of considerable architectural merit and historical interest.  Yet the only bodies committed to their preservation in the face of substantial commercial pressure are An Taisce and the Dublin Civic Forum. Unless the provisions of the Bill are considerably strengthened our national heritage will continue to be frittered away in the never-ending search for a quick buck.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in my short contribution I have addressed one aspect only of heritage, the built environment.  I am aware that the Minister gave an undertaking after the Seanad debate that he would introduce another Bill to deal with that area.  When replying perhaps he would inform the House when it is intended to introduce that Bill.  He mentioned it being a complex area, one warranting a lot of thought and consideration. While he may well be right, I am sure he will admit there is an urgency about the matter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a quotation I wanted to put on the record from President Robinson when she wrote a preface to a book entitled <i>The Great Irish Famine</i> by Stephen J. Campbell &mdash; words and images from the Famine Museum, <Col N="1718" /> Strokestown Park, County Roscommon. It relates to an exhibition on the Famine on display in Strokestown Park, County Roscommon, not an Office of Public Works event or location, rather a privately-owned and managed museum. What is interesting about it is that it achieves what the Office of Public Works unfortunately does not.  It does not present merely a sort of homogenised view of the Famine but offers some alternative views and obliges people who visit the exhibition to think about the issues being presented to them and is successful as a result.  It is worthwhile putting on the record the preface written by President Robinson to this book:</P>
    <P>Every country is quick to make a record of its triumphs.  Most cultures are rich in the lore and anecdote which celebrate heroism and strength. Reading through this book, it strikes me how important it is to make a record of a darker past as well.  There are grim statistics and painful details here.  They give an account of a terrible time; they illuminate the defenceless suffering of the Irish people at that time.  But they serve another purpose as well: they invite us to look steadily at a past we can neither share nor change.  With all its pain and disorder, the past has constructed us in the actual and literal ways of generation and inheritance. Now, if we look at it thoughtfully and clearly, and with the factual assistance of this book and the Famine Museum, that past has the power to do something more: it can construct and strengthen our understanding and our sympathy in the present.</P>
    <P>More than anything else, this Famine Museum shows us that history is not about power and triumph nearly so often as it is about suffering and vulnerability.  Those who have worked on this book and who have developed the project of this museum have done us all a true service: while these things demonstrate that the Famine is a central part of our past, that it is a motif of powerlessness <Col N="1719" /> which runs through our national consciousness, it is also a human drama upon which we, as Irish people, place an enormous value, and by which we have been radically instructed.  As we go through the Famine Museum we have to wonder again and again at the strength of a people who could survive natural disaster and historic setback.</P>
    <P>As we look at these artefacts and open our minds to these stories, we can feel again that it is an Irish strength to celebrate the people in our past, not for power, not for victory, but for the profound dignity of human survival.  We can honour that survival best, it seems to me, by taking our folk-memory of this catastrophe into the present world with us, and allowing it to strengthen and deepen our identity with those who are still suffering.</P>
    <P>It is a view of how we can use our heritage as a means of informing ourselves, of looking at our society today, how we can, as the President says, show our solidarity with those who are still suffering.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Heritage Council is on my mind this morning because, regardless of whether it is proper to draw the analogy, its objectives appear somewhat similar to those of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the conflict in Northern Ireland.  If The National Heritage Council is to achieve its objectives it needs to be borne in mind that, in this case, the Government has turned from being the vandal into the guardian of heritage.  Perhaps the Government needs to acknowledge its failings also if we are to believe that it is on the road to Damascus and that this council will become a reality, as claimed.  I worry when I hear the Government claim that it has always been a wonderful protector of our heritage and needs merely to <Col N="1720" /> continue to be that protector, particularly when I think of the Civic Offices, Agriculture House and the inherent problem of the built environment there, not to mention the interpretative centres.  The Minister will be all too aware of that sorry saga.  Bearing such matters in mind we clearly realise that The National Heritage Council will need to change a number of minds within Government if it is to be successful in protecting our heritage.</P>
    <P>I welcome any Bill that proposes to put in place a programme to safeguard the destruction of valuable and irreplaceable features of our heritage, natural or man made, since they are all equally irreplaceable when it comes to saving them for future generations.  I sound a note of caution that the provisions of this Bill should not be presented or interpreted as a panacea for all our ills.  When I observe the number of legislative measures in place and the types of protection claimed to be in place, I question the benefit of creating yet another layer of protection when we do not appear to have properly resourced or implemented commitments already given, of which there are numerous examples which would cause one to be very wary about another addition to the litany of pledges to protect our environment.  Given a choice, I would prefer to see those commitments honoured, implemented and properly resourced rather than veering off in another direction to create a new body which may cause people to be over-confident while many tasks remain to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I might instance the slow progress in putting in place arrangements to designate national heritage areas, a commitment already given.  I am aware that a number of conservation bodies are very frustrated at the slow progress being made to introduce the requisite protective legislation and arrangements to have those national heritage areas properly designated and protected.  As long as we remain in this limbo of anticipation many areas will continue to be at risk.  This council is not the cure for that <Col N="1721" /> problem because it is forbidden to own land.  It can only do so much, even though it is well intentioned.  If this legislation is to have credibility, that must be addressed.  In my own constituency there is an area which is at great risk not from private individuals but from the State sector in the form of the local authority.  I refer to Rogerstown estuary, an area that is crossed by the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  One part of the estuary is designated an internationally renowned Ramsar site for the protection of wildlife while the inner part of the estuary, because the railway goes through the middle, is not considered as worthy of protection, even though the bird life and wildlife in general is not at all aware that there is any difference between the mud flat on the inner side of the railway and that on the outer side and use both.  For reasons best understood by humans, and certain humans at that, we have decided not to protect the inner part of the estuary and instead continue to allow it to be used as a municipal landfill site.  There is a need for objective analysis of the long term effects of continuing to operate that policy in that area.  Not allowing ownership of land weakens the potential of the Heritage Council to protect heritage under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There are dangers in other areas from certain planning applications for quarries near, for example, a lake which is in itself a wildlife sanctuary.  These things are not properly taken into account when considering planning applications.  Perhaps the Heritage Council will play some role in liaising with the planning authority.  I understand the Minister would want that and I accept his good faith.</P>

      <P>Something the Minister might comment on is the Wildlife Act, 1976 which is long overdue for revision because there are a number of EU directives begging to be transposed into Irish law.  The habitat directive is particularly relevant under the terms of the Heritage Council and it is unfortunate and a criminal scandal that following the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Gregory wildlife is still legitimately terrorised with the blessing of the majority in this House.  Only yesterday I received a message from a constituent pleading that something be done to prevent marauding men, both young and old, from traipsing across land in north county Dublin in hot pursuit of live quarry for their sport on the coursing field.  This has nothing to do with using wildlife as food, as Deputy De Rossa said in mentioning the famine museum.  This is done simply for sport. That is objectionable and I would like it addressed in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the REP scheme is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Farmers have been slow to take up this European scheme.  Even though there is an increased take up, one of the major failings is that there is no monitoring of it. It is important to mention it in this debate, even though it is the Minister for Agriculture who will have most of the responsibility for implementing it. Collective responsibility in Cabinet might be relevant in that the Minister could speak to the Minister for Agriculture about it.  There is a five year budget for the REP scheme of £230 million.  With that money it should be possible to establish proper monitoring of the effects of these pre-environment measures.  It is one thing to declare that measures are being put in place to protect the environment but those of us who are familiar with PR companies and the ability of advertising to present a message know that aspirations to protect the environment do not always <Col N="1723" /> translate into reality.  Proper monitoring will ensure that such aspirations do translate into reality.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this Heritage Council seems to be in the built environment and there is much to be done in that area.  I wonder if the council will be capable of dealing with some of the situations that have come to my attention. In my own town of Balbriggan, the oldest thatched house, Braemor Cottage, was one of the major attractions for visitors.  However, last Easter the house, being up for sale but still being minded, was torched.  It is now roofless and in a serious state of disrepair but not totally destroyed.  However, it is being destroyed by neglect and there seems to be no measure in law to allow the local authority or the State to intervene, as it tries to do in other areas.  The owner is now in England.  The local authority will not become involved, even though that building is of a type that is fast disappearing.  It is letting in rain this morning and its mud walls are disintegrating.  To put plastic on top of its exposed walls would be to break the law because the owner has not given permission to do that.  With the best will in the world one could not protect that building without trespassing.  Serious thought must be given to introducing measures to deal with that kind of situation. There are many examples now since we are in the European Union where the ownership of these buildings is outside the State.  It is regrettable and tragic that something might happen which would damage a building and the owner might not be contactable.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if The Heritage Council will have a role in the planning process which would relate, for example, to the Phoenix Park Racecourse, a heritage site at least in terms of its history, as a first class racing site? Acceptance of a proposal for a casino and large hotel complex, not in line with the zoning in the area, would put an end to any question of racing there again. Will the Heritage Council take note of the wider implications of developments <Col N="1724" /> and not consider buildings and sites in a narrow context but take account of the overall national heritage value of each area of interest in the wider context of how we hand on our heritage to the next generation?  I welcome the Bill, but urge the Minister to have regard to existing legislation and the perception among non governmental organisations that the legislation is fine on paper but that it has not been properly resourced to protect the aspects of our heritage it was designed to protect.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is necessary to strengthen the existing council.  Deputy Sargent referred to people traipsing across land in chase of live quarry.  I am reminded of the debate on the Occupiers' Liability Bill introduced by the Minister's colleague.  Many significant dolmens, castles, abbeys, etc., are situated on farm land and farmers and landowners are nervous about people crossing their land.  Farmers, generally, welcome visitors to heritage sites on their land, but farmers' interests must be protected from potential public liability claims. The proposed Occupier's Liability Bill, closely related to this Bill, must be seen to be fair.  The Minister should consult with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, to ensure that in promoting and protecting our heritage, landowners must be protected against public liability claims from people of all ages.  It has been suggested that landowners will be liable in respect of injuries suffered on their property by people under 18.  If farmers' interests are not protected they will prevent people crossing their land, which will defeat the purpose of this Bill on which the issue of occupiers liability has an enormous bearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the national heritage we must reflect on the position to date. Because of the neglect and hostility of successive Government anything we do now is too little too late.  More damage has been done to the fabric of our heritage since the foundation of the State <Col N="1725" /> than during the Viking invasions.  The treatment of our national heritage since 1922 has been marked by negligence, ignorance and, in some instances, outright hostility.</P>
    <P>This Government by establishing the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is the first to put heritage at the top of political agenda.  I compliment the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, for the enthusiasm he has brought to his task. The work to be done is not only the physical work with bricks and mortar but also involves changing attitudes.  In recent years our attitude to our diverse heritage has changed for the better.  We are beginning to realise that our heritage is not one sided or simple. Thatched cottages and castles alike are intrinsic to the fabric of our past. Equally, the heritage and houses of the ascendancy, such as Dunmain House, are to be valued with the inheritance of the Gael.  It is perhaps due to the interest of the planning authorities in County Wexford to retain a living heritage that the inhabited delightful thatched cottages in Kilmore Quay are being protected.  The planning authorities refused to allow slates or tiles to replace the thatch and Wexford County Council introduced a thatching grant scheme long before the national grant scheme was introduced.  I am pleased the Government included thatching grants in that scheme to assist people to retain the beauties of our countryside. The heritage associated with houses of the ascendancy, such as Dunmain House, must be valued also.</P>
    <P>Last year in my parish of Fethard-on-Sea &mdash; a famous area from where the Ceann Comhairle's mother came&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;something happened which I believe symbolised or changed the attitude to our culture and indicated the best possible role the Heritage Council could play.  The local Church of Ireland, St. Mogues, was in desperate need of repair.  It is a small <Col N="1726" /> stone and slate building dating from the 13th century.  Originally it would have been a place of worship for the Christian community of Fethard-on-Sea.  The Church of Ireland community, though very small, is vigorous.  That church, through the fund-raising efforts of its parishioners, with the enthusiastic support of the local GAA club and the help of the National Heritage Council, has been restored.  The local GAA club and the Church of Ireland community &mdash; some people might say they are strange bedfellows &mdash; came together in a fund-raising campaign to restore the church. That is even more remarkable considering that 35 years ago Fethard-on-Sea was the scene of the infamous boycott. Things and times have changed for the better.  This legislation is part of a process of realising how much time and neglect we have to make up for.</P>
      <P>Our collective attitude to our culture has improved because a small group of people refused to accept the prevailing attitude of ignorance.  A huge debt is owed to groups such as An Taisce, the Irish Georgian Society and countless local groups.  A local group of people, without assistance and often in the face of a great deal of hostility, persisted in the ideal of preserving our heritage.  It is still remembered, I hope with a good deal of embarrassment, that those who tried to save the outstanding Georgian building in Ely Place were dismissed as the blue rinse brigade.  Equally, I hope that Deputy Molloy's attitude then does not reflect the Progressive Democrats' attitude now.</P>

      <P>This Bill aims to give teeth to the National Heritage Council. Previously, the council was not on a statutory footing and was under-staffed and under-funded.  I wish the new, rejuvenated council well in its important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas not covered in the Bill are buildings in private hands, Public authorities are increasingly, if not always, responsible in their attitude <Col N="1727" /> towards heritage.  I compliment the local authority in my area.  Wexford County Council, who in successive years made grants, albeit small, to various sites of heritage significance.  It is responsive to an increasingly responsible mood of public opinion.  No such claim can be made for the private sector and the Minister, Deputy Higgins, admitted his uneasiness with this position.  I stand four square behind him on this issue and ask him to take action.  Short-term private profit cannot be allowed to continue to destroy our heritage and heritage lost can never be recovered.  I ask the Minister to outline his plans in this area.</P>
    <P>Many of our finest buildings and works of heritage are in private hands. Ownership involves duties as well as rights and we must act now to prevent further destruction before it is too late.</P>
    <P>One of the principal private owners if not the main one, are the Churches.  I fully realise the difficulties involved in the State exercising control over the Churches in the arrangements of their buildings.  However, the interiors of our churches are one of the most important parts of our heritage.  There is a great deal of public disquiet about how the Catholic Church in particular is discharging its function, particularly since Vatican II.</P>
    <P>Recently the Victoria and Albert Museum in London staged a massively successful exhibition of the work and life of Pugin, the early 19th century architect who pioneered the neo-gothic revival.  His most famous monument is the Palace of Westminster.  He was a Catholic who devoted most of his working life to the building of Catholic churches.  Some of the finest examples of his work are to be found in Ireland, mainly in County Wexford.  As hundreds of thousands of people from around the world went to the Victoria and Albert in London to view his work, I was embarrassed at the state of the Pugin buildings in Ireland.  Of his many works in Wexford &mdash; the churches at <Col N="1728" /> Gorey and Tagoat, the chapel at St. Peter's College and the church at Ramsgrange among others &mdash; not one remains intact.  The magnificent neo-gothic high altars and sanctuaries have been torn out and thrown out in the name of liturgical renewal.  White collar crime is what I call what has happened in our churches since Vatican II.</P>
    <P>The State cannot order affairs in the churches and it would be improper to even think of doing so.  We should, however, be prepared to help preserve, by way of money and logical support, what is left of our ecclesiastical heritage. We should not hesitate to clearly call on the leaders of all Churches to act in a responsible way towards the buildings in their possession.  These buildings were built and paid for by the people. Just as Church leaders do not hesitate to speak forcefully to politicians, on this issue we should not hesitate to speak forcefully to them.</P>
    <P>However, there are clergy and religious in my county who have in some instances gone beyond their remit to protect our heritage and they too are owed a great debt of gratitude.  I refer to a curate, Fr. Richard Hayes, who protected one of the churches of penal times at Poulfur near my area.  The decision was made locally that the church should be knocked down and replaced.  However, against the wishes of the locals Fr. Hayes decided to retain it.  To this day he is thanked for doing so, and I am sure generations to come will thank him for his foresight and persistence in this regard.</P>
    <P>My immediate area of south-west Wexford is one of the richest cultural areas in the country.  It has been said that the history of Ireland can be written around the ruins of south-west Wexford because there is a monument to every era of history in that locality.  For some reason &mdash; maybe it is because we are nice people &mdash; the invader seemed to think that this was the place to land, whether it be in Baginbun, Bannow Bay, the Hook Peninsula, Duncannon or New Ross, all of which are full of monuments to our varied and rich past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> I and my constituents have no shortage of projects to which the new Heritage Council could devote itself.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the National Heritage Park at Wexford.  This park was the brainchild of Noel Dillon, now working in County Cork, a former county manager of Wexford County Council.  Land laid waste by building a new road was turned into the National Heritage Park, with 16 sites going back to 5000 BC, which boasts 100,000 visitors a year.  It has been said that school children learn more here about history in four hours than they do in all their years in school.  My own locality of south west Wexford is a natural heritage park.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Hook lighthouse, the oldest in Europe, which is now being demanned by the Commissioners for Irish Lights.  It is vital that this monument be maintained.  In that area men have used fire since the seventh century to warn shipping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to thank the people of County Mayo for supporting the people of County Wexford when required in 1798.  The Hook lighthouse was built in the 11th century and since then many lives have been saved.  From 1996 there will be no human presence in the lighthouse unless support is forthcoming to maintain it in the interests of our heritage and safety.</P>
      <P>I now wish to refer to Duncannon Fort from which King James fled to France after the Battle of the Boyne and where the young Oliver Plunkett served mass during the confederacy of Kilkenny.  A local development group has taken over the fort from the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worth of the National Heritage Council will depend on its capacity to help local initiatives to avoid bureaucracy and red tape.  I am referring here to projects such as Dunbrody Abbey; Fethard castle; Ballyhack castle which has been restored by the partnership in <Col N="1730" /> south west Wexford; Tintern Abbey which is in the hands of the Office of Public Works; Baginbun where the Normans landed in 1170 &mdash; some say they were our best tourists because they are still here; Clonmines; Loftus Hall about which a video was made recently and Slade Castle.  Local groups intend to restore each of these for tourism purposes.</P>
    <P>The single most important project in County Wexford is the John F. Kennedy Trust in New Ross.  This trust, by establishing itself as a centre of excellence in emigration studies, will commemorate our people, the finest part of our heritage. As Members will be aware, John F. Kennedy's forefathers left from the quayside in New Ross in 1849 following the Famine.  As the Minister stressed in his remarks, the trust will make an economic contribution in the locality.  It aims to give people a reason to stop and stay in New Ross.  We are conscious of the fact that 1.5 million people pass through New Ross on their way to the west each year and return via the same route.  It is our intention to try to encourage them to stay and enjoy the heritage that is County Wexford.</P>
    <P>The trust's media exhibits will attract casual tourists.  More importantly, by its possession of the most thorough data base, it will establish itself as a centre of research.  The board and management of the trust have been vigorous in establishing links with institutes abroad to ensure it has access to research data. The future of the trust will depend on its forthcoming application for funds to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Higgins, for his encouragement of this project to date.  New Ross, which has a high unemployment rate, is eagerly looking forward to getting the green light for this culturally and economically exciting project.</P>
    <P>Localities throughout the country will benefit under this Bill.  The National Heritage Council has a vital economic and cultural role to play.  The measures being provided for will better equip the council to fulfil its role.</P>

      <P>This fort is of tremendous historical significance.  A local trust was established in 1993 and for better or worse I was asked to be its chairman. This trust is comprised of representatives of Wexford County Council, the local partnership which is doing an excellent job in the protection of our heritage and a strong local heritage group.  Its aims are to develop the fort for tourism purposes by the restoration of the ancient features of the fort and developing and using building for various productive purposes.  It is hoped that this will generate income for the trust on the one hand and have a beneficial spin-off for the community in south west Wexford.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence used to own Duncannon Fort when it was used as a summer base for approximately 100 Army personnel.  This provided a tremendous economic boost to Duncannon village.  When the Army decided to pull out there was a vacuum, financially and otherwise.  It is the intention of the trust to restore Duncannon Fort as the hub of economic activity in south west Wexford, particularly for the village of Duncannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial phase involved a major <Col N="1732" /> clean up programme to restore the moat to its original condition.  This has been successfully completed with substantial works and improvements to the ramparts, ravelin, bridge and sallyports. Security fencing has been provided as well as toilet facilities.  The officers building has been improved and it is now usable for exhibitions, displays, concerts and a meeting room.  Moves are afoot to improve the recreation hall and the standard of accommodation available.  As a consequence it may become a base for the Civil Defence. Tours were provided regularly at the fort throughout the summer and in the first year we attracted some 5,000 paying visitors.  Our success will encourage us to continue providing tours throughout the year.  We have made progress in tourism and we seem to be moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme has played a major role in the development of the fort and the monetary value of work carried out under this scheme is well in excess of £100,000.  Under the Leader programme, work costing £24,000 was carried out in 1993 and Wexford County Council has given grants totalling £13,000 over the past three years.  This has enabled the trust to invest locally when sourcing labour and materials.  Two local people and six third level students from south west Wexford were able to supplement their incomes through summer employment at the fort.</P>
    <P>The grounds and recreational hall have been utilised on a small scale for fund raising events and other activities. We have made progress but we need to develop further and actively promote tourism at the fort.  We need to develop the fort as a centre of vibrant activity and not as a sterile museum that is old and finished.</P>
    <P>Our heritage can provide an economic boost.  The economic benefit of protecting our heritage has to be viewed in parallel and I ask the Minister to take this on board.</P>

      <P>This very important Bill will become increasingly relevant as time goes by.  Deputy Hugh Byrne made a first class contribution which would do justice to a public relations manager selling the attractions of County Wexford. Members from all parties are knowledgeable about their individual areas and it would be a pity if they did not contribute to this debate because when the Heritage Council trawls through the Official Report it will be able to deal with the matters of importance which have national implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People throughout the country welcome the appointment of Deputy Michael Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  He brings a different vision to art, culture and heritage and his efforts to preserve and promote an appreciation of our heritage should be assisted.  The functions given to the National Heritage Council on its establishment in 1988 were broad ranging: to identify, protect, preserve, enhance and increase awareness of Ireland's heritage in the specific areas of archaeology, architecture, flora and fauna, landscape, heritage gardens and inland waterways; to promote among the general public an interest and pride in our heritage and to facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of it; to work closely and make recommendations to Government Departments, planning authorities, public bodies and State companies on all matters within the council's general area of responsibility; to ensure the co-ordination of all activities in the heritage field; to decide on the distribution of moneys allocated for heritage work subject to the approval of the Minister and to decide on the priorities for such expenditure. These broad-ranging functions apply to every square inch of the country because the physical landscape is there for everybody to appreciate.  Deputy <Col N="1734" /> Byrne referred to the Occupiers Liability Bill which is due to be discussed after the by-elections and the Minister will appreciate that this is a matter of genuine concern to thousands of people. The land is held in trust for future generations. Given that people may have an accident or cause an accident when walking over other people's property and may for the flimsiest of excuses seek compensation, this will have to be addressed on Committee Stage and the Minister must take on board the genuine concerns of landowners when people are going to or coming from heritage buildings.</P>
    <P>This Bill establishes a body to be known as An Chomhairle Oidhreachta and in the Irish language title of the council we have a more complete description and a fundamental understanding of what is involved.  The Minister intends to introduce Bills for the National Library and the National Museum and I hope this is done in conjunction with the proposals of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to build new library facilities for the Oireachtas.  I understand that the new facilities in the Oireachtas Library will be linked to the National Library.  The wealth of information in the vaults of this House and the National Library should be made available to the population at large.</P>
    <P>We need to encourage an appreciation of the environment in our schools at primary and secondary levels.  One only has to travel through any town after a busy weekend to see the state of the streets.  The amount of rubbish thrown away by Irish people leaves a great deal to be desired.  The litter problem can be addressed only by the good example of peers and elders and there should be a programme in primary and secondary schools to make school children aware of their environment and their heritage.  It is impossible to appreciate our built heritage and natural environment if we continue with our flippant attitude to the disposal of litter and unwanted items.  That is not good <Col N="1735" /> for the country in terms of our promoting it as one of the cleanest and greenest in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reference to realism in the implementation of the Bill is important also because Bord na Gaeilge is doing an excellent job in promoting an appreciation of our language.  The other areas referred to by him in terms of culture and art are important also.</P>
    <P>Ideas abound in every part of the country for the promotion and preservation of our natural heritage. Dr. Séamus Caulfield, together with his late father, came up with the idea to develop the Céide Fields west of Ballycastle. That is the oldest known stone village civilisation in the world and while the initial projections were for approximately 10,000 visitors per year, there have been over 70,000 since its excavation. Credit should be given also to the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who had a particular interest in the preservation of our heritage.  During a visit to the area he made a personal commitment to provide funding which was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In reference to the Minister's description of economic development as a spin off from the preservation of our heritage, the only flaw I see in that proposal is that if an area such as the Céide Fields is developed, visitors are brought in on tour buses which leave on the same day.  In that event the possible economic benefit to the general locality is lost.  We must remember that one of the aspects of the Bill is the need to sustain economic development in any area.</P>
    <P>If one stands on the hill overlooking the Céide Fields one can see a pyramid shaped modern building.  One can see its concept and design and take into account that every step represents 100 years.  It is interesting to listen to the very realistic descriptions given by the guides, including Dr. Caulfield, which helps one to understand that people inhabited this country over 5,000 years ago.  That type of development is fundamental to us and the more opportunities <Col N="1736" /> we have to understand and appreciate that, the better we will be as a people.  I would like the new Heritage Council to become involved in this type of development and identify future developments, including the preservation of buildings, which can proceed within the economic process referred to by the Minister, in conjunction with the other agencies.  The development of the Céide Fields went ahead without an objection of any magnitude and was generally accepted by all organisations and people in the locality.  I hope that development will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the abolition of the Wildlife Advisory Council and the National Monuments Council whose remit will be covered by the new Heritage Council.  Section 13 (2) of the Wildlife Act, 1976 dealt with policy recommendations on flora, fauna, inland waterways and so on from the Wildlife Advisory Council.  Along the west coast, for example, there has been a serious problem for the past 15 years in particular with migrating seals.  Fishermen using half deck trawlers have an enormous task, given the limitations on their drift net fishing for salmon, in dealing with rogue seals who literally steal their livelihood.</P>
    <P>This problem was highlighted some years ago when unofficial seal culling took place.  I understand the majority of these seals migrate here from northern Scotland and the coast of England and that, under European law, the country within whose jurisdiction these animals normally breed is responsible for them. There have been demands for official culls and something must be done to put an end to this problem.  I am not sure whether the Minister or any of his staff have stood on one of these boats and patrolled a net for salmon which may be invaded by a rogue seal.  It is an interesting experience and if the fishermen are unable to deal with the fish caught in their nets within minutes, they lose them.  While the Wildlife Advisory Council is to be absorbed into the Heritage Council there remains a clear need for specific policy recommendations to <Col N="1737" /> the Minister so that action can be taken and unofficial culls will cease.</P>
    <P>In my county, the implementation of social employment or FAS schemes has been of benefit in terms of preservating and reconstructing old buildings including improving old cemeteries.  Where these schemes are properly implemented in conjunction with the local authority an excellent job can be done.  It is interesting to note that the fastest growing area of tourism is genealogy. A great number of inquiries are received from the United States and Australia from people endeavouring to trace their roots.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether that will be preserved as a heritage building but that is beside the point.  In Ambassador O'Rourke's house in Copenhagen this summer I read O'Kelly's Directory of 1904 which deals with the townlands of Ireland.  It provided an incredible amount of social history and provides detail on buildings that are now 90 years older.  So much could be preserved, but the funding made available to this council will not be sufficient for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo has been in continuous use since 1210. President Robinson opened a newly reconstructed section of the Abbey recently.  It is a magnificant edifice which has been in use longer than Westminster Abbey.  Masses have been celebrated through the period of the Reformation, the Famine and so on and such detail, properly illustrated would give young people a deeper appreciation of their culture and heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should preserve the physical landscape and our archaeology.  There is an old cemetery known as Carne Cemetery on the north coast of Mayo where due to coastal erosion the sea wall has been breached for the last number of years and the remains of people long deceased have been literally washed away by the sea.  The same applies in <Col N="1738" /> the old famine cemetery at Killadoon and the entrance to Killary Harbour. We should preserve the physical landscape which is part of our heritage. Indeed, if the records were sufficiently accurate, one could trace ancestral remains in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council should be in a position with the Department of the Marine to address the problem of coastal erosion.  Many historical areas are literally being washed away and something needs to be done in the case of Carne graveyard and the one at Killadoon. We are told there is no money available to build a sea wall which would prevent erosion.  A paltry sum of £5 million was allocated nationally for the next five years and is completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Council purchased Turlough House, outside Castlebar, which was the home of the mad Fitzgeralds in the 1600s.  It is a fine building and it is hoped it will be developed as a heritage centre with consequent economic development.  The council lodged an application with the Minister.  Many museum pieces dealing with the history of transport, radio and so on which are on State property have never been displayed to the public.  Houses such as this should be developed as centres where such museum pieces could be displayed.</P>
    <P>Famine villages could be developed such as the one at Dádreen at Killary Harbour which the British fleet sailed up during World War I and walks could be developed in conjunction with the Department of Tourism and Trade.  The careful preservation of our landscape and the country code should be fostered and developed.  The international interest in hill walking and cross country walking is incredible and we could do much in this area to develop quality tourism.  Take, for example, the prophecy of Briain Rua Carabine who, in 1500, prophised that the first and last trains into Achill would carry the remains of people killed in various tragedies.  That happened and even though the line was closed it was reopened to transport the remains of <Col N="1739" /> those who died in Kirkintilloch in Scotland and in a boating tragedy in Clew Bay.  The remains of the line are still there and it may be possible to reopen it as a walking or cycle tour.</P>
    <P>There may not be an immediate appreciation of events but future generations will be interested in what happened in their forefather's time.  This country is dotted with castles and the remains of old houses.  I recently visited Moore Hall on the shores of Lough Carra.  It is the ancestral home of the Moores and of George Moore the novelist.  It was burnt down in 1922 at the time of the so-called Troubles. Structurally it is in good condition, a local committee carried out research on it and it should be possible to restore the building.  It is in a magnificent location overlooking the lake and, if restored, could have the potential to boost economic development in the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked me to mention that the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society wrote to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and wished to have included under section 2 of the Bill, to ensure the protection of our genealogical heritage, records of births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, census returns, testamentary and property records, biographies, family histories, heraldic devices, clan, sept and local histories, gravestones and inscriptions thereon.  That is an area of intense interest to tourists.  The Minister will be aware of the letter he received from the society.  The matter was raised in the Seanad but I am not sure what has happened since.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his endeavours in implementing the Bill.  I hope the Government see to it that resources are given to the Heritage Council to deal with the issues I and other Deputies raised.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith líom buíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Kenny as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well <Col N="1740" /> in implementing it.  I am interested in the provisions which relate to wildlife. The Minister will appoint 16 ordinary members of the Heritage Council.  I am anxious that persons who have expertise, a track record in and commitment to the protection of wildlife would be considered appropriate for appointment to the council.  I raised this previously by way of parliamentary question and it was indicated that may well be the case. However, I wish to emphasise it again.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the establishment of committees, one of which would deal with wildlife.  The Minister will appoint three people who are not members of the council to each standing committee.  I hope people who are concerned and active in public welfare and rights will be included as that did not happen in the past.  I do not wish to be critical of past councils but those who were involved in the council established under the 1976 Act seemed to be heavily weighted in favour of the field sports fraternity and, consequently, had the ear of the Minister and access to power which others who are concerned about wildlife, although from a different perspective, would not have.  I hope the Bill will introduce balance in this area.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that there was no great public profile of the Wildlife Advisory Council and little published evidence of its work.  I am not an expert, and have had no time to research this point, but that is what the experts have told me and I have no reason to doubt them.  I make this point in the hope that the work of the new standing committee and council will be made available to groups, interested individuals and the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the protection of our heritage, an issue of great concern, and one which is increasingly generating widespread public disquiet, is the abuse, both legal and illegal, of so much of our living heritage, our wildlife.  During the past year several well publicised television documentaries produced, unfortunately or fortunately as the case may be, by foreign television stations exposed the highly <Col N="1741" /> organised abuse of wildlife.  I am referring to programmes on illegal activities such as badger-baiting and the blooding of greyhounds using live rabbits.  This evening there will be a programme on cock fighting which is, apparently, a widespread, highly organised and lucrative activity in Northern Ireland. Reports in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> state that this activity is being increasingly organised in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is also the legal abuse of wildlife, for example, live hare coursing. Despite the concession by the Government that greyhounds should be muzzled, the abuse of wildlife through this sport for the entertainment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded at your comments, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. This is part of the problem, there is not even a recognition that wildlife is part of our heritage.  I am glad the Bill recognises this point and provides for the setting up of standing committees on wildlife. We have a long way to go in educating even the Members of the House on the relevance of the points to which I have referred and the increasing public concern about the abuse of wildlife, which is an important part of our heritage.  This abuse has been swept under the carpet for far too long by &mdash; I do not mean this in any personal way &mdash; comments similar to those made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, &ldquo;It has nothing to do with our heritage, it is all right if it goes on in our constituency and we will turn a blind eye to it but we should not bring it into the open here&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the Bill which provides for the setting up of a wildlife committee and which recognises the importance of our wildlife.  At <Col N="1742" /> a time of so much public concern about the cruel practices used to abuse wildlife for the entertainment of a very small number of people, the Bill affords an opportunity for the appointment of people to the council and standing committee who will make recommendations which will enable the Government to eliminate many of these abuses, some of which are still legal.  Badger-baiting is now illegal but fox hunting is a parallel activity.  When a fox goes to ground the terrier owners dig it out in precisely the same way as a badger-baiting.  There is also the legal and widespread practice of cub hunting where hounds are blooded using young fox cubs.  This is a disgraceful abuse of our wildlife.  I regret to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for this latitude. The Bill presents us with a real opportunity to deal with the matters to which I have referred in a comprehensive way.  The Government must legislate to protect our wildlife and ensure that illegal practices which are really anachronisms and which belong to the past are made illegal.  All the forces available to the State and the Garda must be brought to bear to ensure that the good name of this country is not increasingly disgraced through the exposure by foreign television stations of activities which unfortunately are still all too widespread.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction and on the fine work he has carried out in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister said that the Bill fulfils yet another commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The central purpose of the Bill, which was originally <Col N="1743" /> introduced in 1982 but lapsed, is to create a semi-State body to take over the executive functions of the National Museum and the Office of Public Works in so far as heritage matters are concerned. I welcome the provision which will replace the existing council with a statutory council which will take over the functions of the Wildlife Advisory Council appointed under section 13 of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The council will also have advisory functions on certain aspects of heritage.</P>
      <P>RTE has shown some very good programmes on heritage.  I recall in particular the programme hosted by Liam Ó Murchú, &ldquo;A Rich and Rare Land&rdquo;, which has been very successful.  I compliment him and RTE on this series of programmes.  One recent programme began by showing the presenter at Aughrim near Ballinasloe where he told the story of the Battle of Aughrim, Raifteirí an File and Lady Gregory. The cameras then moved to Coole Park, Thoor Ballylee, the Céide Fields in Mayo, the Michael Davitt Museum at Straid in County Mayo and finished with the presenter giving a history of Limerick city and county.</P>
      <P>The programme gave a very good representation of events in those areas which are mainly in the west, but it did not deal with the difficult issue of access to heritage centres and the problem of public access to land.  The Occupiers' Liability Bill published by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, will deal with some of those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Aughrim, Ballinasloe, basic problems relating to parking, lay-bys and rights of way have to be sorted out.  I am disappointed that the provisions of the Occupiers' Liability Bill do not cover children.  That is interesting because mostly children visit the centres which were so well presented in the programme by Liam Ó Murchú.  Since the heritage centre was built at Aughrim &mdash; brainchild of the late Martin Joyce whose collection is in the centre &mdash; the <Col N="1744" /> number of children visiting it has increased each year.  This excellent centre was built by Galway County Council with financial assistance from the Structural Funds.  There is a problem, which will have to be addressed, if people wish to visit the scene of the battlefield.  The Occupiers' Liability Bill will deal with that issue.  The phrase &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo; and the fact that children are not included in that Bill must be addressed.  The House will agree that the majority of farmers in Ireland are reasonable and practical people.  They are not the type who would dig holes so that others will fall into them; and they would not let loose a pedigree bull at famous sites.  I hope the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, will deal with those issues.  If there is not proper access to the sites, proper parking facilities and lay-bys we will not be able to show these sites to our visitors and our students.</P>
    <P>The committees formed to help and develop heritage centres will need funding. When replying I hope the Minister will give an indication of what funding is available.  The Minister acknowledged that the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; does not appear in the title of his Department and said that perhaps this is not a bad thing.  He went on to say that heritage is, perhaps, too closely associated with tourism.  Tourism is important and we would like to see the targets for tourism in the national plan achieved.  The most recent announcement by the Minister for Tourism and Trade on increased funding is welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that heritage is not a romantic notion.  We want to tell the story of the Irish people and the way we live.  The Minister said we are interesting people living in interesting places.  This is something of which we can be proud when we welcome visitors to our towns, villages and cities. Although the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; is not in the title of the Bill it embraces all the work in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I hope that will always be the case.  I ask the Heritage <Col N="1745" /> Council to acknowledge the contribution of communities who have provided extra funding.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has increased the personnel in the heritage section of his Department.  He told the Seanad he has appointed three technical personnel: an archaeologist, an architectural historian and an ecologist whose function will be to take the advice of the Heritage Council and put it into policy statements for the Minister.  They will also have to produce initiatives and seek to have the policy implemented by the Department and the Minister.  There is some concern that the Heritage Council may be seen as a funding agency.  Since the legislation is being put on a statutory basis I hope the advisory functions of the Heritage Council will be under the umbrella of one body and that the role of the council will be strengthened in relation to the protection of architectural heritage in public ownership.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an important point in relation to buildings owned by local authorities.  He said the Heritage Council could have a veto if there was a decision to demolish, alter significantly or dispose of a heritage building. I understand this can only be done if the Minister or the Government agree with the plans of the local authority.  I hope to return to the question of the local authority later.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of who is responsible for a heritage building or any building of historic significance.  In my own village where a Church of Ireland building is in need of repair there is a doubt as to whether it is owned by the local authority or the local church body.  In most cases the county council is responsible for a cemetery but it is not always clear who is responsible for the church.  However, we must take into account that some of these buildings are in a dangerous state and sometimes one has to act quickly to ensure that the danger is reduced and that refurbishment works can be carried out on these buildings.  I compliment particularly the work done by FÁS.  The community youth training scheme for those <Col N="1746" /> under 21 years of age has been used in possibly every parish for work on all kinds of buildings from sports centres, dressing rooms to repairing halls and even providing theatres in various towns.  This has been a success story. The social employment scheme is for people over 21 years of age.  The community youth training scheme has been of enormous benefit and I have seen some of the great work they have done. Obviously the FÁS office has a problem if they have to wait for other bodies to decide who owns property.  Can the Heritage Council acquire a building in the event of a dispute between two or more bodies?</P>
    <P>I welcome section 7 which provides that the council may make recommendations to the Minister and require him to respond to such recommendations within six months.  Section 8 imposes a requirement of the council to respond to the Minister's requests for advice and information regarding the performance of its functions.  Section 9 provides that the Minister may, after consultation with the council and after consideration by the Government and with the approval of each House of the Oireachtas, confer additional functions on the council relating to national heritage. The latter is an important section in that the Minister can confer additional functions on the council relating to national heritage.  I ask the Minister to examine many of those buildings where work has been done in the past but where extra funding is needed.  I refer, in particular, to work done by the Glenamaddy Arts and Historical Society in County Galway who spent a large sum of money in refurbishing a town hall to provide a theatre. Funding for that project was provided through the county enterprise board.  I hope such groups are supported by the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that local authorities will have a role to play in terms of our heritage.  The Minister stated that the local authority will be required to <Col N="1747" /> notify the Heritage Council of its proposals relating to heritage buildings and will be prevented from carrying out a proposal contrary to the council's advice without Government agreement. I am sure local authorities will welcome the provisions of section 10, provided funding is made available.  I hope the Minister will ensure work is carried out in consultation with local authorities. Section 16 provides for the exclusion from membership of the council of members of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament. As many members of the Oireachtas are members of committees such as the national monuments committee, county council arts committees and so on, they would have great experience and could play an important role in this area.  I am pleased local authority members are not excluded, but there is no reason Members of the Oireachtas could not serve on the council.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for a declaration of interests, something which would not cause a problem for Oireachtas Members on the council because they would have made such a declaration as members of local authorities.  Members of the Oireachtas who are members of local authorities should be eligible for appointment to the council.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the tidy towns committees for their great work.  Some years ago Galway County Council decided to present county awards.  All counties are improving their marks in Bord Fáilte competitions.  The town of Mountbellew has won the Galway county award for the past number of years and is steadily increasing its marks in national competitions. Its tidy town committee would like the town to win a regional award for which it would receive £5,000.  That money could be used to develop other amenities in the town.  I hope Mountbellew achieves that objective in the next few years.  Many other towns and villages are now competing with Mountbellew.  This proves that competition in the county is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Funding is important and I hope <Col N="1748" /> towns trying to highlight a certain feature &mdash; the square or a certain building &mdash; will get the necessary funding.  Local authorities have drawn up plans for certain towns and some have engaged the services of town planners to highlight particular areas which they would like to have developed.</P>
    <P>Other Members referred to the role of the Office of Public Works.  It was suggested that two Government Departments should not be involved in national heritage matters.  The Office of Public Works has done tremendous work and it responds positively to any project brought to its notice.  The ceiling in the Seanad Chamber is one of its finest pieces of work.  The professional work done in Dublin Castle, at the Céide Fields and at Dún Chaoin are examples of the excellent work carried out by that office.  Regardless of whether The Heritage Council or the Office of Public Works has responsibility for our heritage, more publications should be circulated.  Professor George Eogan produced an excellent publication under the discovery programme which highlighted what can be done here.  I am not referring to the publication of reports in Irish and English six months after 31 December each year, but publications listing the works carried out which would be useful to students.</P>
    <P>Members referred to damage to the environment, to ringforts and historic buildings.  The rural environmental protection scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last January is significant in this regard. The scheme will provide a sum of £230 million up to 1997 and has been widely welcomed.  In his speech at the 50th anniversary of Macra na Feirme the Minister said he was disappointed in the take up of the scheme.  While some people may have reservations about it, its objectives are praiseworthy.  The first two are relevant to the environment.</P>
    <P>The first objective is to establish farming practices and pollutant control methods which reflect increasing public concern for conservation, landscape <Col N="1749" /> protection and wider environmental problems.  The second objective is to protect wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna.  I hope the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which have been taken on board by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, will achieve the objectives of this scheme.  The policy is to encourage farmers to retain wetlands, wildlife habitats, hedgerows, stone walls and stone buildings and to protect any feature of historical or archaeological interest.  These are all worthy objectives.  I note that farmers who participate in the rural environmental protection scheme will be paid a premium of £122 per hectare up to a maximum of 40 hectares.  This involves a figure of almost £5,000 for participating farmers.  Farmers with an average farm of 24 hectares will be entitled to almost £3,000 per annum for five years, in addition to other incentives available within areas designated by the Office of Public Works.  This scheme is worthy of support and is very much in keeping with this Bill.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has indicated his support of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Wildlife conservation, which forms part of the rural environmental protection scheme Bill and falls within the remit of the National Heritage Council, is causing some concern generally.  One of the most urgent problems is the preservation of the corncrake.  I hope the efforts being undertaken under the REP scheme will eliminate some of those wildlife problems.  I hope the National Heritage Council will be successful in its endeavours and will co-operate with the Northern Ireland Heritage Council.  I have seen the excellent work done on the Ballinamore/ Ballyconnell Canal.  There are many opportunities for the implementation of similar schemes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his work to date and hope he will continue to obtain the necessary funding so that the heritage left to us by our parents and grandparents will be preserved for future generations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus aontaím leis an Aire go bfhuil an focal &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; níos fearr ná an focal Béarla &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; ach, is dócha, muna bhfuil Gaeilge ag duine níl rogha idir an dá fhocal aige.  Tá fuaim agus brí deas ag an bhfocal &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; agus tá súil agam go ndeánfaidh an Bille seo agus an Comhairle maitheas chun an oidhreacht a chosaint dóibh siúd atá ag teacht inár ndiaidh.</P>
      <P>Heritage can be described as a thing of the past with a great future, the onus on us being to protect it so that we pass on to future generations that which we have inherited in as good, if not better, condition, using modern means of protecting buildings or artefacts that might otherwise crumble or fall into dereliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we appreciate and take a broad view of all aspects of this heritage, not perceiving it as something preserved merely for mad professors or organisations with one track minds.  We have not treated our heritage properly. Archaeology is an enormously interesting subject which should be taught at second level.  Most of these aspects are covered in history, geography or arts classes.  At primary level also it receives a fair crack of the whip in the course of history lessons when a class may deal specifically with, say, dolmens and other such artefacts, thus instilling a desire to study archaeology at that level.  It warrants a separate subject within the schools' curriculum.  Archaeological study at primary level may be carried out in an unofficial or light manner but nonetheless lays a foundation and arouses children's curiosity in the subject.  It is a pity such studies are not continued at second level as a separate subject so that, as pupils grow older, they will more readily appreciate what our heritage means to us.  Archaeology forms one component of that heritage, dating back many centuries, covering such artefacts as dolmens, cairns and the like, demonstrating the lifestyles of former generations.  It should be a separate subject within the schools' curriculum <Col N="1751" /> rather than an ancillary one, thereby giving pupils greater knowledge and understanding of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I once had the privilege of having a pupil of mine.  Paul O'Neill, bring a bag of stones into school.  I thought they contained several pieces of archaeological or historical interest and on bringing the stones to the National Museum it was found that amongst them there was a Stone Age axe-head, a really important item I had not identified up to that time.  That artefact is now housed in the National Museum.  The more people with knowledge of such artefacts the greater will be the hope that, when digging house foundations or whatever, they will recognise such items.  One can never over-educate young people, mol an óige being the old maxim; if one encourages them they will arrive.</P>
    <P>I note that historical monuments have been included in the provisions of this Bill but I am amazed that the National Museum has been excluded.  The Minister intends to introduce special legislation for that purpose, but nonetheless I find it difficult to understand why the National Museum, the showhouse of much of our national heritage, has been excluded.  We have already stressed the importance of local museums.  I hope the Minister will introduce that legislation very soon because my fear is that the National Museum will be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that wildlife has been included, though of course it forms part of our heritage.  Deputy Michael Kitt devoted most of his remarks to stressing its importance.  Even he should realise that many customs centred around wildlife. The people involved in fox hunting in rural areas are more interested in showing their horses, demonstrating how well they can survive long chases across stone walls and fences.  They would not even see a fox were one in the area, nor would they give a tuppeny curse whether it was hunted.  Rural life has traditions dating back many centuries. Linking cruelty and badger baiting with some of these customs is unfair. <Col N="1752" /> Nobody wants to see cruelty but I see nothing wrong with the hunt, when I was young, it was a great form of amusement to watch it, especially when riders fell &mdash; it was hilarious.  I do not think I ever saw them rising a fox, not to mention killing one.  It is not part and parcel of the hunt to dig a fox out of a burrow or a den.  One does not have to be involved in hunting to do this.  Many activities, for example, badger baiting or cock fighting are indefensible but fishing and hunting are part and parcel of rural life and people are not out to inflict cruelty.  It is a custom, and I see nothing with continuing it.  We cannot have it both ways.  The previous speaker said it was important to have people with different viewpoints on the Heritage Council.  It is true there must be a balance, but it must have members with a sensible outlook on life in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Gun clubs do much to protect endangered species and train young people to treat wildlife with respect.  Fishing clubs also do a tremendous amount of work, not alone in teaching the skills of fishing to young people but in teaching them to protect the environment and even to give their time to clean up river-banks etc., to make the countryside enjoyable for others.  Much time is spent by gun clubs and fishing clubs in training young people and giving them a sense of responsibility, this is far better than roaming the streets and getting into mischief.</P>
    <P>Much could be done in Dublin city to teach people, young people especially, to respect animals.  Now would be a good starting point because we read accounts in the papers of what happened over Hallowe'en.  Sometimes big dogs are kept in unsuitable houses.  Bigger animals need plenty of exercise and, although pampered, well fed and with a lovely gloss on their coats, one could argue that it is not fair to have them locked up in smaller houses where they cannot exercise.  On the other hand one could argue that if people like to keep animals and look after them well, it <Col N="1753" /> counteracts the drawback to the animal of being kept in a small area.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for having a broad outlook.  It is easy to say that people involved in all sorts of sport enjoy its cruelty aspect.  It is impossible to explain to people who are anti-coursing that dog owners want to win the cup and it is a question of one dog beating the other and getting the first turn; they do not have to kill the hare, and nowadays with muzzling that is out.  Nevertheless people are depicted as being intent on savagely killing hares while they cheer and shout and roar.  That is not the position but it is a waste of time telling that to people who do not want to believe it.</P>
    <P>In section 10 the Minister is preparing for a Coalition fallout.  It deals with local councils' involvement with buildings regarded as coming under the aegis of the Heritage Council from which they can get advice if they want to renovate, demolish or anything else.  Subsection (3) states that where the council has advised against a proposal referred to in subsection (2) the public authority shall not commence work on the proposal unless (a) the Minister agrees to the proposal or (b) the Minister agrees to a modified form of the proposal or (c) the Government agrees to the proposal.  Is this in anticipation of another situation such as that in Mullaghmore where one Minister may have one view while his colleague in another party has a different one?  If the council advises the Minister who in turn refuses permission to the county council to touch a building, why should the Government overrule the council and the Minister?  To put it at its simplest, does that not leave the Minister in the halfpenny place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> No? I will await the Minister's reply, but it is strange.  If the council says something should not be done by, for example, Carlow County Council, and the Minister agrees, who then will advise the Government?  Will it be the person with <Col N="1754" /> the most pull or the person who has contact with the larger party in the Coalition Government?</P>
      <P>Section 23 deals with fees which can be a problem.  If a farmer is ploughing his field or opening drains and comes across something he thinks might be of historical importance and contacts the council, it would be grossly wrong to charge a fee for its advice.  The same thing might happen in the case of a builder.  In both cases the inconvenience caused can be enormous, especially if they have to stop what they are doing. Charging a fee might deter people from contacting the council.  However, people should be encouraged to seek advice even with the risk of false alarms because if only one out of ten items turns out to be important, it will have been worth it.  The threat of having to pay £25 or the travelling expenses etc., of the person coming to inspect the item should be avoided because it would discourage people from doing their duty and being good citizens.  I hope to see clarity in regard to fees.  Section 23 says that fees may be charged, that is fine provided it is not enforced too rigidly.</P>
      <P>I am also fascinated by the fact that almost four pages deal with declaration of interest.  Leaving out the introduction, definitions and so on, there are only about nine pages left which means that the meat of the Bill is the question of declaration of interests, I am not sure whether it was printed some time ago or lately.  Objects that go back 25 years or more are covered &mdash; I hope there are no mines in anyone's back garden of which they are unaware.  Why all this fuss in regard to declaration of interests?  Certain buildings may be of value but this is overdoing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been said that the council should be able to give financial aid to people.  It will be a tootheless tiger if it can only give instructions when people look for assistance.  Many people across the country are preserving our heritage, giving of their time and money.  The Carlow Historical Society and its members do much work preserving and even taking photographs of <Col N="1755" /> buildings.  I was fascinated to see, when our own church was being redecorated, that one of the members of the historical society took photographs of the church before it was touched.  At the time I did not see it as significant.  Anyone walking into the church at the moment will see a lovely church but older people will have memories of a different church and it is nice to have a record.  Such people all over the country are doing so much to guarantee that our heritage survives, at their own expense. When making appointments the Minister should consider people with a good track record.  It is very easy to get spoofers with all the theory of this type of work who never do a tap.</P>
    <P>Many people from all walks of life are experts in this field.  This year I met an American who visited Carlow to trace records.  He paid glowing tributes to the local people for their interest, knowledge and assistance to him in tracing his roots.</P>
    <P>This year also I visited Ellis Island and saw the film about our ancestors who struggled to survive &mdash; although many did not &mdash; on their journey to the new promised land.  The descendants of those people in the United States would like to come to Ireland to trace their roots.  Deputy Kenny read a letter from the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society requesting that the Bill include a provision covering the records of births and baptisms.  If only for selfish reasons we should urgently address this matter to fulfill the demand of people in the United States who genuinely want to trace their roots in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the summer I met three ladies from the United States who were overjoyed to find a second cousin here with whom they could communicate.  What Irish Americans do not know about Ireland is unbelievable, but there is a demand to have all those records traced.  While many people throughout the country are involved in that work, An Chomhairle Oidhreachta should assist those people because some of the records will disappear.  The location of <Col N="1756" /> many tombstones have been recorded, but the records should be stored on computer to enable people with a minimum of information to trace their roots. We owe it to the descendants of people who had to leave Ireland and travel on overcrowded disease ridden ships to maintain records.  Their descendants, perhaps third generation, are genuinely concerned about finding out who they are.</P>
    <P>It would not be fitting not to refer to Carlow as the hub of Irish heritage as it has the Browneshill, sometimes known as the Kernastown Dolmen, the biggest one in Europe, sometimes erroneously described by officials from the Department and Office of Public Works as the biggest dolmen in Ireland.  Its capstone is estimated to weigh 100 tons.  It is located half a mile from the school in which I taught for many years.  I was always fascinated by the number of foreigners who either came to the school or who I met on my way to or from school who asked directions to the dolmen while many local people would hardly know where to find that dolmen. We tend to neglect all those things.</P>
    <P>That dolmen is in the centre of a large field.  The farmer who owns the land was very kind but had to put up with much hardship.  At one stage he got fed up and threatened to close off access to the dolmen.  Now a fence runs right out to the dolmen in the middle of the field and this is a nuisance to a tillage farmer in this age of modern machinery.  Children regularly visit the dolmen.  Some years ago, before the dolmen was fenced off, children from a Dublin school visited it and a young fellow, who thought he knew more than everyone else, took off, got caught on barbed wire and the farmer had to pay £10,000 compensation following a court case.  The issue of public liability is very serious.  It is indefensible that a farmer who owns land on which a dolmen is located &mdash; as it is a national monument he must let people visit it &mdash; can be sued for compensation by people who injure themselves while damaging his property.  The proposed Occupiers' Liability Bill seeks <Col N="1757" /> to differentiate between invitees, trespassers and so on.  There should not be any justification for farmers being sued by people who go on their property and cause damage.</P>
    <P>All members who spoke on this matter in the Dáil defended the interests of farmers.  However, a provision in the proposed Occupiers' Liability Bill provides that farmers will be liable in respect of injury suffered by younger people on their property.  Why should I be responsible for someone, irrespective of their age, who I did not invite or encourage to enter my property who falls into a manhole?  How can monuments be open to the public if the owner of the land on which it is located is liable in respect of injury suffered on his property?  Despite the good wishes of most Members this matter will not be dealt with properly because the Minister dealing with the Occupiers' Liability Bill intends to make unfair exceptions.</P>
    <P>There is a fine example of a Romanesque doorway in the ruins of a church in Killeshin.  It has been well preserved and signposted by local people.  I will not take the Minister on a tour of Carlow. I could mention Carlow Castle, Clonmore Castle, Leighlinbridge Castle and the picturesque St. Mullins.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the Bill which will add considerably to the legislative base for activities in the areas of the arts, culture and heritage.  The Minister and his officials must be complimented for bringing forward this Bill following the enactment of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  This legislation arises from a decision of the Fianna Fáil Party and Labour Party to establish the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and to put the National Heritage Council on a statutory basis.  The council was established in 1988 and all interested parties will welcome the regularisation of the position of the council.  I had the opportunity to speak on Second Stage on the National Monuments Bill and this Bill represents a further important administarative landmark in the identification, cultivation and preservation of our national heritage.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht gives the Government the opportunity to redress the regional imbalance that has occurred in the establishment of art and culture centres throughout the country. I believe &mdash; this view has gained momentum in recent years &mdash; that everyone should have easy access to arts activities and that areas of cultural and heritage value should be given equal priority.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the need to invest on a regional basis the substantial Structural Funds that are available to his Department to ensure that the regional imbalance in arts infrastructure is redressed, particularly taking into account the need for investment in the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discuss this Bill at a time when thankfully substantial progress has been made in the peace process.  The Minister, in nominating the members of the <Col N="1759" /> council, should consider giving substantial representation to people from Ulster.  It is important at a time like this that common links such as culture and heritage that are shared throughout this island be given recognition and that we take the opportunity to build on those strengths.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the heritage of the province of Ulster.  The first settlement of human beings in Ireland can be traced back to 8000 BC at Mount Sandel in County Derry.  The Neolithic or Stone Age saw the first farmers, and traces of that settlement were found in Counties Tyrone and Limerick.  The megalithic tombs in that era include the splendid tomb at Cohaw in County Cavan.  The late Tom Barron of Bailieboro carried out extensive and valuable research to identify that tomb.</P>
    <P>Our schools and educational institutions have a vital role to play in the preservation and nurturing of our heritage and culture.  A visit to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra, Hollywood, County Down, outside Belfast, is a most enlightening and exciting experience which should be highly recommended to all schools and indeed to all adults.  I would like to know what percentage of schools from the South have travelled to Hollywood to visit this museum.  It gives major coverage to the history of the flax industry, including a flax scutching mill.  There are also spades from the mills of the nine counties of Ulster.  There is an endless range of farm implements and cottages have been removed and reconstructed on this site.  It is a splendid collection of our material culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>The Navan Fort at Armagh is another rich endowment.  The province of Ulster has numerous and very valuable historical societies such as Breifne in Cavan, Farney in Monaghan and the Armagh and Donegal Societies.  I hope that the Heritage Council will help such groups, if necessary, with their publications and will have a co-ordinating role in the work of these societies, which carry out very important work and contribute <Col N="1760" /> enormously to the preservation of our rich heritage.</P>
    <P>The development of new county museums will add greatly to the spread of cultural facilities.  I welcome the development of the new county museum in Ballyjamesduff.  Many artefacts from County Cavan are stored in the National Museum.  Dr. Wallace, Director of the National Museum of Ireland, has indicated to me that he will co-operate fully with the establishment of the county museum and will give favourable consideration to the return of items of local and national importance to Ballyjamesduff, so that they can be preserved for the county in a permanent facility.  I was glad to receive confirmation from Dr. Wallace that the Kil-lycluggan Stone, which was found in my home parish of Templeport, will be returned to the County Cavan Museum. This stone dates from the early Celtic period and has been held in the National Museum.  The stone, on its return to the county museum, will have far more meaning and far greater historical relevance in that environment. The development of the museum will provide a much needed tourism and visitor focus for the county and the region in general.  Fortunately we have in the county the &ldquo;pig house&rdquo; collection and indeed the county is indebted to Mrs. Phyllis Faris for her assistance in making this collection available, which will no doubt form a centrepiece in the new museum.</P>
    <P>I raised previously in this House the possibility of having the great mace of Cavan restored to the county &mdash; it is at present held in the Ulster Museum, Belfast.  I understand the mace was returned to the original donor's family and was subsequently sold at auction in Dublin in 1967.  That great mace was presented to the corporation of the Borough of Cavan on 29 June 1724.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to negotiate with the relevant authorities in Belfast for the return of this precious item to another part of the province of Ulster, namely, to its home in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> In his Second Stage speech the Minister said he sees the need to proceed down the road of decentralisation in policy implementations.  I hope that due recognition will be given by the National Heritage Council to the role of local authorities and voluntary community groups in the care and management of our rich history.  The local authority in my area, Cavan County Council, is co-operating with local groups in preserving our rich history.  It has carried out extensive research on the possible development and linkage of monastic sites in counties Fermanagh and Cavan. The sites in question are St. Mogue's Island, Drumlane and Trinity Island in County Cavan and Boa Island, White Island and Devenish Island in our neighbouring county of Fermanagh. The decision to concentrate on island monastic sites will create an alternative tourist amenity based on two central factors: their location on major navigational waterways and their rich historical and archaeological content.  The development of this proposal would be an ideal cross-Border project.  I hope the Minister and his Department, Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works will give favourable consideration to this matter under the INTERREG II Programme.  There is a proposal in the National Development Plan to invest in products for specialist tourists, and the monastic island sites proposal has the potential of being marketed towards those tourists.</P>
    <P>On St. Mogue's Island on Templeport Lough stand the remains of a 6th century church ruin.  A 12th century settlement was established by St. Mogue who received his training at Clonard under St. Finian.  St. Mogue's shrine was discovered on this island.  On Trinity Island on the shore of Lough Oughter are the remains of the Abbey of the Premonstratensian Canons founded around 1250.  The Romanesque doorway in Kilmore Cathedral is thought to have originated on Trinity Island.  Located on this island are headstones of note dating from the middle ages to the modern age.  The oldest building at Drumlane <Col N="1762" /> Abbey is the round tower, with a roundheaded doorway and windows.  Beside the tower stands a medieval church which is thought to date back to the 13th century.  The western doorway has some fine stonework, with unusual features of bishops and abbots of the 15th century.  There are also carvings of a monarch on the outer side of the door and windows.</P>
    <P>Devenish Island is a very important site on Lower Lough Erne.  The earliest buildings include the Church of St. Molaise.  I understand it has one of the best examples of a round tower in Ireland.  A museum was established on this island in 1976 and it preserves many of the stone fragments found there.  Boa Island is renowned for its two highly unusual stone carvings found at Caltragh cemetery on the island.  White Island contains the only complete round-headed Romanesque doorway surviving in the Six Counties and it is also well known for its stone figures.  I understand an early Christian date has been given to these monuments.</P>
    <P>One of the central links between these locations is St. Mogue who was born on what is now known as St. Mogue's Island.  The saint is linked with Drumlane Island and when he attended St. Finian's school at Clonard he befriended St. Molaise who later moved to the Devenish Island monastery.</P>
    <P>Similarities can be found between the round towers on Drumlane and Devenish islands and artefacts discovered on Devenish Island have strong similarities with the Romanesque architectural features found at Kilmore Cathedral which may have originated on Trinity Island. Presumably, life on these islands varied little due, primarily, to their proximity. The common themes should be developed and made available, not just as a visitor attraction but as an enrichment of our understanding of history. The similarities and differences between the various monastic sites should be an interesting theme to develop and would provide a useful alternative tourism product in this part of Ulster.  Deputy Byrne referred to St. Mogue who <Col N="1763" /> brought Christianity to County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, another area that comes under the remit of the National Heritage Council is the development of our inland waterways.  Some of the islands to which I referred are accessible by the restored Ballyconnel-Ballinamore Canal.  The extension of the Erne navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra would provide access to Drumlane Island.  This proposal would afford an opportunity to increase the range of cultural and heritage tourism products, particularly with the development of the monastic sites along the Erne and Lough Oughter complex.  Tourism interests in the Border counties could only benefit from such a development, in terms of employment and improved cross-Border relations.  I commend the county manager and county engineer in Cavan and the officials who drafted this imaginative proposal.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to support the project at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister referred to the economic benefits that would accrue from a proper cultural policy.  He also emphasised the need to strike a proper balance in dealing with such riches. When in Government in 1987 Fianna Fáil targeted tourism as a potential growth area in terms of employment. This decision has been fully vindicated given the substantial increase in employment in the tourism sector and the increase in foreign earnings.  The response of 65 per cent of holidaymakers to this country that they visited historical sites underlines the importance of our heritage and the need to preserve and enhance it.</P>
    <P>The decision of that Government in the late 1980s to restore the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal was courageous and imaginative and will pay rich dividends for the economy, particularly the local economy in the counties of Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim.  I refer to that decision because the development <Col N="1764" /> of inland waterways is one of the functions assigned to the National Heritage Council.  The restoration of this historical amenity and the revitalisation of the 19th century link has created a continuous inland waterway of 875 kilometres which uniquely enriches this country's tourism potential and provides one of Europe's best leisure amenities.</P>
    <P>A commercial value can be put on the restored canal and this can be measured in terms of the numbers of tourists, weekend visitors and cabin cruisers.  We should also take into account that the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal is a fragment of Europe's past and is now a living and working link with the 19th century.  The cut stone bridges have been preserved with some modification and considerable repair.  I compliment the Office of Public Works and ESB International on their engineering skills in bringing this project to fruition.  I understand that every element of reconstruction was organised to ensure that animal, bird, fish, insect and plant life along the derelict canal were preserved in their natural habitats.  The cross-Border nature of the project proved that cooperation can be readily achieved between bodies on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to progress another proposal at present before the Departments of Finance; Tourism and Trade; Arts, Culture and the Gaelthacht and the Office of Public Works, on the need to extend the Erne navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra.  This project would complement the restored Ballyconnell-Balinamore Canal and add considerably to the economic well-being of the Killeshandra, Belturbet and Ballyconnell areas and a sizeable portion of our neighbouring county, Fermanagh.  In the context of the recent political developments on this island, I appeal to the Minister to give this project priority in view of its cross-Border nature.</P>
    <P>Our literary and musical heritage must be given due recognition.  The works of literary figures from County Cavan such as Edgar Alan Poe, Henry <Col N="1765" /> James and Cathal Bui MacGiolla Gunna, in whose honour the late Uachtaráin na hÉireann.  Cearbhaill Ó Dálaigh, unveiled a John Behan sculpture, are not as readily available or as widely known as their quality demands.</P>
    <P>The revival of Irish music and its quality is one of Ireland's marketing strengths.  I know individuals in my own county who are doing tremendous work in teaching Irish traditional music.  The teaching of traditional music should be assisted either by the National Heritage Council, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht or the Department of Education.  Teaching could be provided by suitably qualified music teachers in schools, Comhaltas branches or under vocational education programmes. I am aware that many of those engaged in this activity on a voluntary basis find it more and more demanding, in terms of the cost of insurance, heating and lighting and rent.</P>
    <P>Teaching children in ceilí bands or groups involves time and effort and additional burden of fund-raising can act as a major deterent.  Teaching music could be formalised whereby those who have completed the teacher's course at Comhaltas Ceoltoirí Éireann and classes would be more widely available. This would also result in the creation of employment.  This matter should be investigated and perhaps a pilot project could be introduced in an area such as Cavan under the local vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a local group in my own county, namely, Mullagh, in County Cavan, which is developing a St. Kilian Heritage Centre.  I understand that this centre was refused funding by the National Heritage Council and I hope that such developments in future will be eligible for substantial grant assistance.</P>
    <P>St. Kilian was born in Mullagh around 640.  He travelled with his brother monks, Colonat and Totnan, in 680 to the European mainland to spread Christianity.  The three missionaries were martyred in Wurzburg, Germany in 689 but they had planted the seeds <Col N="1766" /> of Christianity which continued to grow after their deaths.  It is noteworthy that throughout Germany today churches and chapels have been dedicated to Kilian and his companions.  Thanks to the efforts of the local community in Mullagh and their counterparts in Wurzburg substantial numbers travel from Germany each year to visit Mullagh and from Cavan to Wurzburg.  Such developments and exchanges are welcome from several points of view.</P>
    <P>During the past few years the condition of graveyards throughout the country has improved immensely due to greater awareness among the public and the sizeable contribution of FÁS.  There is a vast array of architectural heritage in our Catholic and Church of Ireland churches and gospel halls.  The same is true of hospital, jails and workhouses. As we approach the 150th anniversary of that unfortunate and desperate period of Irish history, namely, the Great Famine, I appeal to the Minister to pay special attention to the workhouses, particularly those that remain intact.  I understand that an interdepartmental committee has been established to co-ordinate commemoration programmes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for the incoming Heritage Council to identify workhouse buildings that remain intact and to have sensible restoration works carried out.  In my village, Bawnboy, a workhouse is intact and the council wishes to develop it.  The adjoining graveyard is derelict and does not offer those buried there the dignity they deserve.  The condition of such graveyards is no longer tolerable and radical improvements are called for.  I hope the Department or the Heritage Council will ensure that every Famine graveyard is properly marked and is up to the standard that we expect today.  A target date should be set, such as the commencement of the commemoration programme of the Famine, for those works to be completed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with section 16 which provides for the exclusion from membership of the Heritage Council of <Col N="1767" /> Members of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament. If a Member of the Oireachtas has expertise which would be helpful to the council I fail to see why this Bill provides for the exclusion of that person. The case of the former Senator, the eminent Professor George Eogan, comes to mind.  This exclusion of Oireachtas Members and public representatives from councils, boards and bodies is not a healthy development. Public representatives have a mandate from the public and they should be eligible for nomination to bodies such as the Heritage Council.  Will the Minister, who has served with distinction in both Houses of the Oireachtas and on local authorities, review this section?</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to decentralisation and perhaps he would consider locating the headquarters of the new council in a provincial town.  I suggest the province of Ulster and I recommend Cavan be chosen.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht ar an mBille atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  Beidh Oireachtas na Gaeilge ar siúl i mo cheantair dhúchais, Baile Dhún Gharbháin, congarach do Ghaeltacht cheantair na Rinne.  Caithfimid ár moladh a thabhairt do choiste an Oireachtais as ucht an dea-obair atá á dhéanamh acu chun leas teanga agus cultúir na hÉireann a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that this Bill is being discussed during the week that the Oireachtas festival is taking place in Dungarvan, County Waterford, and in the adjoining Gaeltacht areas of Ring and Old Parish.  A sad occurrence was the death a few weeks ago of Nioclás Tóín, one of the most famous sea nós singers of all times.  Some of the ceremonies during the Oireachtas will commemorate Nioclás Tóín, who not only had a brilliant voice but had probably the greatest repertoire of old Irish and English songs of any singer in modern times.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will achieve <Col N="1768" /> better results than achieved heretofore. I see the division of responsibilities between Departments as the main technical difficulty.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance, and a division of that Department, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Tourism and Trade and the wildlife division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry all have a role.  I do not know if it is proposed to continue with the division of responsibilities but we have the perfect opportunity to break the mould and embrace national monuments, the culture and traditions of the country and the language in one Department.  I have no doubt that the Minister would be delighted if that were the case and that the mandarins in the Department of Finance were convinced of this.</P>
    <P>It is very frustrating to deal with the Office of Public Works, whether one is involved in building a school or in a public building of any sort.  In recent years they have had some wonderfully dedicated archaeologists who have done tremendous work with very limited resources both in terms of manpower and finance.  They are facing an almost impossible task in the face of overwhelming interest in our history and traditions. It is obvious from the Deputies' travelogues that enormous developments are taking place.  I know there is provision in the Bill for additional finance to be made available but if the Minister could secure significant financing and control of the Office of Public Works he would be able to achieve what he wishes.  I know how difficult it is at Cabinet to wrestle responsibilities from other Ministers.  Neither they nor their civil servants want to give away their responsibilities but I would like to see the Minister getting more clout as additional finance is badly needed.</P>
    <P>If ever a Department was made for an individual, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is made for Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  There could not have been a more perfect choice. Previous speakers referred to the <Col N="1769" /> fact that the former Taoiseach had responsibility for culture, the arts and the language while Taoiseach.  That showed his concern for our heritage.  He did an excellent job and it is not easy for a Taoiseach to take on additional responsibilities such as these.  Mr. Haughey went to great lengths to promote the arts.  The tax incentives he provided more than 25 years ago were a tremendous boost for artists here.  His endeavours to help the Gaeltacht were considerable also.  We have had Ministers for the Gaeltacht, with no responsibility other than for the Gaeltacht, who achieved considerably less. Of course, being Taoiseach, he had great clout in the allocation of funding to various areas.  The office does have its advantages in that regard.</P>
    <P>Five or six years ago a Cabinet Minister, who has since been elevated to a higher position in Europe, told me that there were to be no more grants for reconstruction because the Taoiseach at the time, former Deputy Charles Haughey, was dead set against the grant mentality.  He could not be blamed for that.  There were to be no more reconstruction grants for housing.  Every six months I tabled a question to the Taoiseach asking that grants be reintroduced for rethatching of houses.  On the first occasion he fended off the question without any problem; on the second occasion I began to get under his skin and on the third and fourth occasions he became visibly annoyed.  Before I had an opportunity to ask the question for the fifth time, he announced that he intended to reintroduce the grants.  It was an achievement to have these thatched houses retained because they are a major part of our culture.</P>
    <P>In the intervening years before the grants were reintroduced many thatched cottages in my locality were reroofed with corrugated iron, asbestos and other such materials.  I realise many of these cottages fall into disrepair through natural circumstances but it was a mortal sin to see part of our culture being destroyed in front of our eyes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> My party welcomes the Bill, the additional funding that will be provided and the establishment of a stronger council because our culture and heritage is being destroyed daily.  I am sure every Member knows of an individual who has destroyed an historical monument before a preservation order could be placed on it.  Whether one is talking about a ring fort, a listed house or an historical structure of some kind, if a developer or a landowner believes his work will be inhibited due to the placement of a preservation order, he will rush in and destroy the site.  I am aware of such incidents taking place.</P>
    <P>How many ring forts are there here? How many were there 30 or 40 years ago?  I would say the figure is less than 10 per cent.  Most of the ring forts have been destroyed or bulldozed into the ground and that is a dreadful reflection on our society.  It is only in the past 25-30 years that there has been a recognition of our culture and heritage.  Prior to that historical monuments and items of great cultural value were regarded almost as a nuisance.  They often indicated a background of poverty, in particular the old thatched cottages.  Rather than preserve them, the inclination was to destroy them.  We are now trying to make up for lost time.  Unfortunately, much of our heritage has been destroyed in relatively recent times.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to events that took place hundreds of years ago and it is right that they should do so but I am concerned about an issue that is not often mentioned, namely, our more recent history.  There seems to be a reluctance to discuss events of the 1920s and 1930s because they are regarded as the bad old days.  But it is not just the ancient history that is neglected, recent history can be neglected also.</P>
    <P>I live very close to a Gaeltacht area in County Waterford.  Perhaps I am under an illusion but in the late 1960s and early 1970s a new impetus was given to the Irish language in that Gaeltacht area of Ring old parish.  Prior to that, there was almost a stigma attached <Col N="1771" /> to being an Irish speaker.  People deliberately went out of their way not to speak Irish.  I may be accused of scaremongering or telling mistruths but that was my understanding of the situation. Then came a resurrection of pride in things Irish and for the past 25 or 30 years I have seen young people speaking Irish and they are deeply offended if people do not speak Irish in response to them.  That is a relatively recent occurrence.  At that time fishermen, farmers and working people in those areas would speak Irish among themselves unashamedly; they were proud of their tradition but they were a little cowed in the presence of outsiders.</P>
    <P>There is now a tremendous wish to speak Irish at all times and it is wonderful that a tradition such as the Irish language, on the verge of disappearing in many areas, is now stronger than ever in certain areas.  I do not know if the same is true in the Connemara, Donegal, Kerry or Cork Gaeltacht areas as they are much larger, but I hope it is.  I have seen this happen in a small Gaeltacht area, the most easterly Gaeltacht area in the country if one exempts the small Gaeltacht in County Meath created by people who were resettled in that area by the Land Commission.  I am talking about a natural Gaeltacht in an easterly part of the country and that change in attitude is delightful.</P>
    <P>Many of us feel guilty if we do not speak Irish but some of us are not linguists. I do not speak French or German but my children do.  I feel guilty about that but some of us are good at speaking languages while others are not.</P>
    <P>Some of today's contributions were like a travelogue of the various counties. I remember the Pathe News which used to be shown in cinemas with the old films and J.P. Fitzpatrick, quite a famous fellow at the time, who gave a running commentary on every country in the world.  That is what today's debate sounded like to me.  Deputy Enda Kenny made a point which is indicative of what has happened in <Col N="1772" /> recent years.  He referred to Kelly's Directory of every business in Ireland, published in 1905.  I was in the Irish Embassy in Copenhagen on the same evening.  A few of those present were shocked to find that their forebears were not mentioned.  They thought they were people of considerable substance. That highly informative directory is not available in the Oireachtas Library.  I tried to get it through the county library in Waterford but failed to do so.  It is a magnificent publication about six inches thick.  The ambassador informed me that one of his staff bought it 20 years ago for £1 in a second-hand book shop in London.  It is sad that no library has it when there may be very few copies available.</P>
    <P>What happened to the Folklore Commission which was so active after the foundation of the State until the early 1950s?  I remember an old man telling me sometime in the 1950s that he had recorded a series of interviews with someone from the commission.  One of the top people in the commission died a year ago.  I do not remember his name. There is a wealth of information available about life in the latter part of the last century which was handed down from grandparents and parents to children. The commission would have gathered together an enormous amount of material which is locked away in an archive in Dublin.  I have never heard of it being made available.</P>

      <P>It is not much use locked away in UCD.  Provincial newspapers are the most widely read publications and if such information were channelled to the local newspapers it would be of considerable help to people who wish to find out about their background, the mud huts our ancestors lived in and which our grandparents and parents did not want to talk about.  Part of the reason we do not know much about our comparatively recent history is that our <Col N="1773" /> parents and grandparents did not to talk about it as times were so bad.</P>
      <P>When I was working in England I met people who emigrated as teenagers. Although now in their fifties they never returned to Ireland because there are too many bad memories.  Many people who emigrated to America did not even correspond with their families.  They had a reasonable standard of living and they wanted to forget the awfulness of their youth.  It was too much to think about.  The information collected by the Folklore Commission should be made available and promoted.</P>
      <P>At Question Time I regularly put down a question about the connection between Newfoundland and the Waterford Estuary but I think I am wasting my time.  It is the greatest ethnic connection between Ireland and any part of the world.  Few countries in the western world have the same kind of relationship. I continually ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will appoint a consul, not just an honorary one, to reactivate the link between Newfoundland and the Waterford area.  My information is that traditions which have been lost to this country are alive in Newfoundland. They speak with the same flat Waterford accent &mdash; my accent is not as flat as I live closer to Cork &mdash; as can be found in Dunmore East, Passage East, Ballyhack and Duncannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the need to restore graveyards.  Great work has been done in this area by those on FÁS schemes and by the county council.  An excellent <i>Radhairc</i> documentary was made about the south coast of Newfoundland about ten or 15 years ago. They showed people doing traditional Irish dances and showed tombstones bearing the names Power, McGrath, Morrisey, Foley, Flynn, Hickey and all the names associated with the south east.  The Christian names were also similar for example Ignatius.  Their culture is the same as it was here 60 years ago.  However, I am told by those in the Memorial University in St. John that the culture is fast disappearing with the advent of television.  We have made no <Col N="1774" /> attempt to have a link with them and that is disgraceful.  I plead with the Minister to try to do something about it.  The obvious way is to have an Irish Newfoundland Society or Waterford Newfoundland Society backed up by a consul based in Newfoundland.</P>
    <P>It was virtually a province of Ireland and the closest we ever came to having a colony, not that we ever wanted one. In 1785, 90 per cent of the population in St. John were from the Waterford Estuary area.  That takes some beating.  The Welsh maintained a link between the Welsh sheep farmers who emigrated to Patagonia several hundred years ago. They speak the Welsh language and have their own Eisteddfod or national festival each year.  They retained those customs.  The Welsh ensure through the British Foreign Office and statutory cultural bodies &mdash; perhaps the National Trust or the body responsible for national heritage &mdash; that those links are maintained.  We make no effort in this area and are letting these links die.  The Germans are well known for being assiduous in such matters and they maintain their links with colonies in Russia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania.  Last year I visited Brasov in Romania which is almost totally German and which maintains its links with Germany.  The only link we maintain is St. Patrick's Day when we send Ministers to all parts of the globe, Guinness is dyed green and everybody, regardless of whether they are Hispanic, Negro, Irish or Polish, dresses as if they are Irish.  It is nice to celebrate St. Patrick's Day but it does not address the problem. I am talking about natural traditional links which are being allowed to die.  We have been neglectful in this regard and the Minister is the only person who might bring about improvements in the areas to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The points I have raised are relevant and illustrate the need for us to give ourselves a pinch every now and again and remind ourselves that we have an obligation to pass on our culture to future generations.  We celebrate St. <Col N="1775" /> Patrick's day in a flamboyant and colourful way but this is superficial and does not deal property with the problem.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there has been a tremendous improvement in the approach to local history, the Irish language, traditional music and set dancing. There has also been a significant increase in the number of gaelscoile-anna. I welcome these positive developments. I have highlighted the areas in which we have been found wanting, without wishing to be malicious or critical &mdash; if anything, I am self-critical &mdash; but in an effort to prick people's conscience so that the things which should have been done years ago are done before it is too late.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which will put the Heritage Council on a statutory footing.  This Bill and the National Monuments (Amendment) Act are part of the integrated body of legislation which has emanated from the Minister's Department.  The Minister and other speakers have acknowledged the excellent work carried out by the Heritage Council.  We are aware of the concern expressed by the council that its role in policy formulation was limited and that in some cases it was viewed merely as a funding agency.  I join with other speakers in acknowledging the excellent work done by the Heritage Council and am confident that putting it on a statutory basis will be enormously beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of An Comhairle Oidhreachta must be all embracing, incorporating as they do the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of our national heritage including monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects, works of architecture, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks, geology, heritage gardens and parks and inland waterways.  I must confess that if I were asked to define some of these I would have a certain amount of difficulty in doing so and would find it difficult to draw a distinction between them.  It is <Col N="1776" /> obvious that the policies put forward by An Comhairle Oidhreachta will require co-operation between a number of Departments and several authorities and agencies.  It is important that the necessary framework to facilitate this co-operation is put in place as a matter of urgency and that it is binding on all parties.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte mhór roimh ráiteas an Aire go bhfuil sé ag ullmhú Billí i gcomhthéacs an polasaí a bhí taobh thiar de bhunú a Roinn féin.  Tá tábhacht ollmhór ag baint le gnó na Roinne. Tréaslaím leis an Aire as ucht an dul chun cinn atá déanta aige i leith déantús scannán.  mar shampla, gnó atá titithe i laige go mór sa Bhreatain agus atá méadaithe go mór faoina choimirce sa tír seo.  Cruthaíonn sé nár gá go mbeidh costas gan brabús ag baint le cúrsaí ealaíona i gcónaí.  Táim cinnte go mbeidh breis dea-scéala ag an Aire i gcúrsaí scannáin amach anseo.  Faoi mar a tharlaíonn, tá gaol liom féin ina cathaoirleach ar Bhord Scannán na hÉireann, agus cé nach n-aontaímid faoi gach rud, tréaslaím léi as an obair atá á dhéanamh aici féin agus ag an mBord.</P>
    <P>Mhol mé an tAire cheana go príobháideach faoina rinne sé i leith alt 31 den Acht Craolacháin.  Ba chéim bheag íar shlí amháin, agus cáineadh an tAire go mór ina leith, ach ba chéim thábhachtach í ar an mbóthar i dtreo na síochána. Molaim go poiblí anois é ar an méid a rinne sé.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go mbeidh roinnt mhaith den fhoireann sa Chomhairle Oidhreachta gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Geallann an tAire go mbeidh daoine le suim, eolas agus cleachtadh acu i gcúrsaí oidhreachta ar an bhfoireann, go mbeidh fo-choistí sonracha le bunú ag an gComhairle, agus go mbeidh foireann agus airgead dóthanach acu chun a gcuid dualgas a chomhlíonadh. Deirtear go minic gurb é sin an fhadhb is mó a bhíonn ag bord mar seo, nach mbíonn a dhóthain airgid acu chun an obair a dhéanamh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh leanúnachas amach ó obair an sean-Chomhairle, a rinne sár-obair ó thaobh na seandálaíochta, an dúlra agus <Col N="1777" /> a lán réimsí eile den oidhreacht de.  Má bhí laige ag baint leis, b'fhéidir go ndearna siad a gcuid oibre go ró-chiúin agus gan mórán bolscaireachta.</P>
    <P>In this regard I look forward to the Heritage Council embarking on a campaign which will raise awareness of our environment and bring home to individuals and groups their specific responsibilities and the fact that the setting up of a Heritage Council does not absolve everyone else of their responsibilities in the heritage and environment areas.</P>
    <P>Recently I have been doing some walking in parts of my constituency and the southern part of the Minister's constituency. When one drives along roads one sees very little apart from what is immediately visible.  I have been appalled at the amount of indiscriminate dumping inside walls and very often in beautiful spots where there are lay-bys.  The hundreds of thousands of drivers who drive along these roads never notice this dumping and are not aware of the damage being caused.  I presume that the people responsible are not aware of the enormous damage they are doing.  When one is walking along a road at a leisurely pace one sees and smells this dumping which is much more widespread than we think.</P>
    <P>A neighbour of mine who discovered an amount of material dumped on his property rummaged through it until he found an address.  Subsequently he got a car and trailer, loaded up the offending material, took it to the house of the person and dumped it in a beautifully manicured front lawn in broad daylight in the presence, presumably, of the offending individual.  I used to think that person had gone a little too far but now I realise it is an extremely widespread problem that needs to be addressed. Even if the problem is not always obvious, dumping is an appalling attack on the landscape and the beauty of the country.</P>
    <P>I recall another occasion where a person rummaged through material and found correspondence addressed to an eminent professional person.  If I thought that person was aware that the <Col N="1778" /> material was dumped in the particular beauty spot.  I would despair of any council or State authority succeeding in bringing home to people the necessity to refrain from this type of activity and to show some respect for the countryside. I am amused when I hear people say that all the problems stem from the education system and that teachers ought to be able to instil a civic spirit in young people and persuade them that this activity is undesirable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I laboured in a classroom for 20 years. Any person who has had that experience will say that you come to realise how little influence you have in a great many ways.  Other major influences on the lives of young people greatly outweigh that of the teacher.  Perhaps teachers become disheartened because their efforts are not reflected in the views of the community at large and often could be forgiven for thinking that their admonishments fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>To solve this problem there must be community awareness and response with the aid of FÁS or other schemes. There is, of course, a role for local authorities. I am not suggesting that the comhairle should have a direct role, I am merely trying to illustrate the difficulty and the enormous job of the comhairle in raising awareness in the area of landscape and environment.</P>
    <P>In section 12 there appears to be a prohibition on the council accepting a gift of land.  As the reason is not apparent I ask the Minister to explain it.  I am also interested in section 18 &mdash; not that it will ever affect me &mdash; in that it appears that the provisions concerning staff of the council who may become members of the Oireachtas are not in accordance with the current practice for other civil servants.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's undertaking to employ specialist staff: an archaeologist, an ecologist and an architectural historian.  I am sure they will contribute greatly to the work which the comhairle will be able to undertake and to the efficacy of its efforts.  In appointing <Col N="1779" /> members to the council the Minister will appoint people with knowledge and expertise.  He has been here long enough to know that no matter whom he appoints he will leave himself open to all kinds of attacks and accusations.  I am sure he will appoint people who have shown commitment and who have expertise in the heritage area.  We are fortunate to have a great many people with those qualifications.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable to criticise the Office of Public Works and to fault its every move.  It has been unfortunate to have been involved in high profile cases and wrongly criticised by environmentalists for its involvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>And by the Minister, who is one of its most vocal critics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, while all public authorities must be open to scrutiny the attacks on the Office of Public Works &mdash; not by the person mentioned by Deputy Dukes &mdash; by many other people have been unbalanced and unfair.  We need to acknowledge publicly that excellent work has been done over a long period by the Office of Public Works.  In almost every county one could point to the successes.  At the end of the day, history will judge them to have been extremely successful.  In my constituency there was a controversy in which, unfortunately, people took unnecessarily adversarial stands.  I hope that controversy will soon be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fail to acknowledge the excellent, unsung, contribution which ordinary people have made to the preservation of our heritage and landscape.  I am reminded of farming practices in my own area where the depredation, referred to by Deputy Deasy and others, has not happened to the same extent as in other parts of the country. That is because people have a genuine concern for the environment and archaeological remains and have made a conscious decision to preserve them, sometimes at considerable personal <Col N="1780" /> cost.  I do not think that people outside the area who take lofty stands on environmental issues have ever been prepared to acknowledge the enormous contribution these people made.  sometimes on a relatively small scale, within their own area of influence.  In the overall picture their contribution is worthwhile and ought to be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the effect of some of the new agriculture schemes and, indeed, previous schemes, on the rural landscape.  I am reminded of the rural environmental protection scheme and the CFP scheme which are just beginning.  I argue strongly that there needs to be basic differences, from one area to another, in the way these schemes are administered.  The comhairle should have a strong advisory role in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the question of access and the problems of public liability.  That matter will be addressed, to some extent, in a Bill which will come before the House the week after next.  It forms the framework of legislation on which the kind of law which will meet the difficulties of property owners can be based.</P>
    <P>The appearance of farmyards has changed substantially.  The visual impact of some modern farm buildings have made an enormous difference to the landscape in terms of their appearance. We also need to refer to the intellectual heritage of the country.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the Irish language and the fact that Bord na Gaeilge is charged with responsibility in this area.  I read in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that the number of students in arts, studying Irish, has increased from 169 to 510, in the Universities of Galway, Cork and UCD over a three year period from 1992 to date.  This is an enormous increase and reflects the views of Deputy Deasy that the Irish language is beginning to gain a level of acceptance it did not previously enjoy.  It is interesting to note that more <Col N="1781" /> than three times the number of people are studying the language at third level within a three year period.</P>
    <P>I recall discussions during the late 1960s about the likelihood that the Gaeilge departments of universities would have to be disbanded for lack of interest and lack of students who would be interested in pursuing the courses. Unfortunately, that is a reflection of an interest among a relatively small group and does not appear to be widely reflected in interest in the language in the community.  Perhaps a certain exclusivity has crept into the usage of Irish and how it is perceived by ordinary people.  That is a difficulty that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The national folk collection which is a tremendous body of material is not on public display but is worthy of display. It will require a large premises and much expense will be involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated his intention to introduce a museums Bill, which I presume will deal with this area.  This important area of heritage has been neglected in the sense that it has not been available for public inspection by people who have an interest in it.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by the Deputies were dealt with during the three day Dáil debate on the report of the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>The official who amended the CBF briefing note explained his reasons for amending the document to the tribunal and these are outlined at page 544 of the tribunal report.  He also explained to the tribunal that he did not intend to mislead anybody and that he was certain that he would have discussed the amendment with the author of the original document.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of the debate on the report of the beef tribunal on the 3 September it has never been the policy of my Department to alter documents for the purpose of misleading and I condemn any such practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither I nor my predecessor were aware of the amendment to the document until it was brought to the attention of the tribunal by counsel for the State in June 1992.  The official who made the amendment to the document indicated to the tribunal that he and a junior official in the division which prepared the composite Department's brief for the joint commission were the only <Col N="1783" /> officers immediately aware of the amendment.  The consequences of the amendment of the document as seen by the chairman of tribunal are outlined on pages 214 and 545 of the report of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is nevertheless, clear that the document concerned was prepared as briefing material for a Minister engaged in discussions relating to trade and was not in any way intended as background for decisions to be taken in regard to export credit insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any other document edited or altered in any way without the author's permission since the Minister took up office?  As Minister, does he accept the doctrine of ministerial accountability and, if so, would he take responsibility for any document proven to be altered without the author's permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the official who made the alteration and one other were the only people aware of the alteration.  Does the Minister recall the official's evidence at the beef tribunal in which he stated that the alteration was widely known throughout the Department, had departmental approval and was in accordance with acceptable departmental policy?  As that was the evidence given under oath by the office concerned, how can the Minister say only two people were aware of the alteration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>From the information available to me, only the official concerned, who was named at the tribunal, and one other were aware of the briefing document prepared for the Minister of State who was going on a trade mission. In his report, the chairman of the <Col N="1784" /> tribunal did not attribute any wrongdoing to the official concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

That was the effect of the editorial work carried out by his official, apparently without approval.  Is the Minister aware that it cost the State £20 million?  Is he also aware that on day 121 of the 321 days of evidence, counsel for the State, which included the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, stated that it was difficult if not impossible to establish whether intervention beef went to Iraq.

I asked whether he was accepting responsibility for half the £35 million the beef tribunal cost taxpayers because of the forgery of the CBF letter which hid from counsel for the State, the fact that most of the beef supplied to Iraq was from intervention.  Does the Minister accept that 121 days of the 321 days of evidence was spent trying to establish the source of the beef which would have been readily evident had not the CBF letter been doctored, forged or edited by his Department?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the chairman of the tribunal made it perfectly clear that had the brief prepared for the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce by CBF, and not by the Department of Agriculture, been forwarded, as was intended by CBF, to the Minister of State and the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1988 when this trade mission took place, that Minister of State, and that Department, would then have been aware that intervention beef was being very widely used in supplying Iraqi contracts, as CBF said, that the whole question of the policies and guarantees for very large sums of money might never have arisen; that the chairman of the tribunal found that to be an extremely serious point which he constantly reiterated and to which he referred in the course of his report?  In view of the fact that the Minister's Department was made aware by CBF in 1988, and were themselves aware in 1988, of the widespread use of intervention beef in Iraqi contracts, can he explain why my Department was not informed of that fact when a query on that very point was made in November 1989?</P>

      <P>I accept that as stated on page 214 of the report of the beef tribunal, that would be the case if the original document had been made available to all Departments, including Deputy O'Malley's and the Department of Agriculture.  I might also point out that in volume 120B of that report the chairman said:</P>

      <Quest>arising from Parliamentary Questions 101 and 104 of 13 October 1994, the response he has received, formal or otherwise, from the EU Commission regarding measures to alleviate the situation of our pig and poultry sectors; the help that will be available; and when help will be available.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No response has been received from the EU Commission to the notification by my Department of the provision of additional resources for CBF to intensify their pigmeat promotion programme or to the submission by my Department seeking action on Irish feed prices, although the former <Col N="1790" /> was discussed briefly at a recent meeting of the pigmeat management committee. Until the Commission's response is received, it is not possible to say what or when assistance will be available.  However, the Commission has indicated that a separate proposal to relieve pig producers temporarily of the veterinary inspection levy would not be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the promises he gave last April of considerable measures to alleviate the hardship in the pig and poultry sectors are still awaited?  Will he indicate the type of measures he would like to take to alleviate the extreme pressures on pig and poultry competitiveness since there are 10,000 people employed in the pig sector and 7,000 in the poultry sector and there has been a crisis for several years, in fact since the revised CAP cereal regime was put in place?  What will the Minister do to alleviate hardship and loss of jobs in this sector?  Is he concerned about the seriousness of the problem and the loss of jobs?  When will we hear precisely what he intends to do?  For example, will there be a cereal incorporation subsidy, a feed equalisation grant?  What does he intend to do and will he say how quickly something can be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the position of pig producers, particularly the smaller ones, and have been endeavouring to identify and assist them, but this is rendered difficult because of EU regulations on direct aid to pig producers.  I have authorised Teagasc to recruit additional staff.  I have put some pressure on the European Commission to authorise the sale of intervention barley and wheat.  I have sought Commission approval for urgent consideration to adopt appropriate measures to restore and maintain the price relationship that existed between Irish feed prices and those obtaining elsewhere in the European Union prior to CAP reform decisions being taken. Suggestions put to the Commission to <Col N="1791" /> achieve this were a transport subsidy and the release of intervention grain. We are still in negotiations with the European Union on these matters.  At each monthly meeting of the Council of Ministers.  I have raised this matter and have had bilateral discussions with Commissioner Steichen about the pigmeat difficulty and the prices being paid to pig producers is Community-wide.  I am hopeful that there will be some positive outcome of our negotiations in Europe.  In the meantime, I have had discussions with pig processors and grain merchants to ascertain whether they can be helpful, particularly to the smaller pig producers.</P>
      <P>I have also made available an extra £2 million to CBF to allow them intensify their pigmeat promotion programme. While this is and always has been a cyclical type industry the position over the past month or so has not been quite as bad as it had been over the past year.  I accept that the industry has been in quite a depressed state but the most recent prices up to last week were 103.6p per kilo and the price of feed has come down by approximately £10 per ton from July to October this year.  The margin is relatively good but does not compensate for the long duration of the recession.  I continue to exert pressure on the European Commission to endeavour to assist, in particular, the family-type pig producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister investigated the price of compound feed from our millers?  Does he consider there is any evidence of a cartel among pigmeat processors?  Would he consider the immediate removal, or even reduction by half, of the veterinary inspection levy, pending a response from Brussels on the other points he has put to them? Does the Minister understand the urgency of the position for these two sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the urgency and am sympathetic to their position.  I know that some of the <Col N="1792" /> smaller family-type producers are going out of business.  The real problem for me is that European Union regulations preclude me from giving direct aid to those pig producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should remove the veterinary inspection levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a specific case to the European Union for the removal of the levy.  The levy is about £1 per pig and would cost in the region of £3.5 million.  I would be quite prepared to do that were it within Community regulations.  However, I have been told that it would be illegal to do so.  I have done everything possible to try to help pig producers, the one sector that has gone through a difficult time.  I know sympathy is not much good to them and that they want something tangible. I met the processors and told them that in the long term interests of the industry they need to keep their producers in business.  I also told them that in the context of environmental considerations it would not be in the interests of the industry to be too concentrated. I also met with the grain merchants; put pressure on them and the price of grain has reduced by £10 per tonne.  The margin is far better now but it does not make up for the duration of the operation of depressed prices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 27 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the beef carcass classification scheme is under review in my Department.  Consequently, no decisions have been taken as to the extent of my Department's future involvement in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should point out that EU regulations permit carcass classification to be carried out by meat factories under the general supervision of the public authorities and, indeed, this is the practice in several member states.  In Ireland, carcass classification for pigmeat, in a limited scheme, for sheepmeat, is carried out by the factories under the supervision of my Department. In our review of the beef classification arrangements our aim is to ensure that we have in place the most effective and cost-efficient system possible.</P>

Will the Minister agree that under whatever system we have, justice must be done and be seen to be done? Will the Minister assure us that he will not change the system to one that is less transparent and less independent than the present one and ensure that there will always be a proper appeal system? Will he consider leaving the present system, albeit with efficiencies?  As one wise commentator put it, to ask the factories to grade the meat and hence decide the price the farmer will get is like playing a football game with the referee playing for the opposition.  The system should be transparent and fair.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>Ireland's position on the proposals made at the meeting of agricultural ministers in Brussels on 26 October 1994, regarding the protection of animals during transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is fully supportive of proposals for the improvement of animal welfare during transport and it is regrettable that the Council of Ministers could not agree on the detailed rules in the matter at recent meetings.  The main difficulty at the most recent meeting was objections by most member states to a Presidency compromise that would allow individual member states to impose separate national limits on the maximum length of journey for animals destined for slaughter.</P>
      <P>I have indicated to the Council that I am open to any reasonable compromise which would emerge to improve the rules for the welfare of animals being transported so long as we have the same opportunity as other member states to supply livestock to export outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also consider that a journey limit on <Col N="1795" /> its own should not be seen as the full solution; the entire range of controls to protect the welfare of the animals needs to be taken into account with a view to a comprehensive improvement in animal welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's words sound hollow in view of the fact that his Department refuses to release a report which was commissioned by it on the welfare of animals and live shipments. In view of his statement to the House, will the Minister agree to release that report in order that the public, who paid the bill for this report, will have an opportunity to see what is the current position and how the Minister can ensure the welfare of animals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years we have had a tradition of exporting live animals.  We have taken great care in regard to the conditions applying to the animals.  It is important not just for the welfare of animals but also for commercial considerations.  In regard to animal welfare, we have veterinary inspectorate controls and we insist on the very highest standards.  They relate to the density of the animals per vessel, ventilation, fodder, etc.  We insist on the issuing of a licence of fitness of each animal before it goes aboard a vessel.  A few months ago I had to issue an order to close the port of Greenore to ensure facilities there were maintained to the highest standard.  Even with controls incidents occasionally occur which should not.  That has happened on not more than two occasions in many years. We insist on the tightest possible controls so that there is no cruelty or stress to the animals concerned.  It would not be in the interests of Irish stock owners if animals reached their destination in a stressed condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will agree that the Minister is guilty of evasion.  I asked a simple question relating to a report which he has, in effect, suppressed publication of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> We have just heard a little dissertation on animal welfare which is all very interesting, but it has nothing to do with the question I asked the Minister.  I asked the Minister if he would release the report commissioned by his Department on this issue which was paid for out of the public purse and which he is suppressing even though there have been requests through his Department for publication of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest care is taken of animals in transit.  The Department, its inspectors and officials take every possible precaution to ensure that animals are well treated and taken care of in transit.  The subject of an Adjournment debate last night was why so much care is taken in relation to air transport of animals out of Knock.  The reason was that the Department insists on there being the best conditions available. As to the report in question, I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to have that internal document made available for public consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the real reason for not publishing this report that its findings would prove embarrassing to the Department?  Will the Minister confirm that the report states that Irish cattle and sheep routinely arrive at their destinations displaying signs of dehydration and infection?  Will he also confirm that the report alleges that week-old calves are being shipped abroad for the veal market and go unfed for 25 hours and longer?  Is he not concerned also that to date this year 227 animals died while being transported from this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast bulk of animals transported from Ireland are adult cattle.  From a commercial point of view it is in the interests of the industry and <Col N="1797" /> the transporters that animals arrive in the best condition.  From an animal welfare point of view it is the responsibility of the Department to ensure that the conditions on board are adequate. Recently, I have been criticised because the Department did not commission vessels to transport animals from Ireland.  I do not have a difficulty with ferries as long as they meet the highest possible standards.  Unfortunately, there are accidents on ferries to humans as well as animals but every effort is made by authorities in all countries to prevent them.  Ferries must continue in operation and accidents are minimised to the greatest possible extent by the authorities concerned, including the Irish authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department has co-operated fully with live animal exporters on the question of transport facilities.</P>
      <P>Any new transport facilities which operators wish to bring on stream will have to meet stringent welfare-related standards.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will continue to co-operate fully with such operators in the evaluation and approval of facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Animals continue to be exported to the Continent and progress has been made in putting in place alternative <Col N="1804" /> transport arrangements.  There is no evidence that there has been a deterioration in prices attributable to the decision of some ferry operators to withdraw their livestock shipping services.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues who facilitated me by putting down questions in their names.  I thank the Minister for his response and concur with him that exports of livestock must conform to the highest welfare standards. Will the Minister agree that he has not been overly enthusiastic in his efforts to resolve the present impasse and lack of ferry facilities for livestock exports because of his bias towards dead meat processors?  That is the view of livestock producers.  Will he confirm that an impasse and a lack of ferry facilities almost suits present Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to co-operate with ferry operators as long as the standards on those ferries conform to the international recognised standard for the transport of animals concerned. We have a considerable livestock export trade which last year, extended to approximately 375,000 head of cattle; this year it will reach approximately 400,000 head of cattle.  I am responsible for the development of the overall industry and I am mindful of our processing industry.  One of the first jobs I had to do when I took office was to seek to maintain production in plants in Bal-laghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, Camolin, County Wexford and Charleville, County Cork.  I am glad they are still in production, but we need to maintain a balance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that to ensure a fair return to our farmers for their cattle both avenues are necessary, namely, the dead meat trade at home on which I agree with the Minister is very important and an export outlet as we have surplus production to our domestic needs?  Does he agree that we need a balance to ensure that the producer, the farmer, gets a fair return? What, if anything, is the Minister's Department doing to ensure adequate ferry facilities of a proper standard are available for the export of our livestock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is vitally important to have balance in the trade between the processing industry and the live trade.  As approximately 400,000 head of cattle will be exported this year that balance obviously exists.  Prices in marts around the country show there is a strong competitive element.</P>
      <P>I had discussions with a number of commercial ferry operators who informed me that additional vessels have been made available.  Prices in marts throughout the country in recent weeks have been maintained and I will ensure that ferries meeting a standard will be licensed by the Department.  At the December meeting of the Council of Ministers I expect a Community wide uniform standard for the transportation of animals by ferry and on land will be decided to ensure safety, lack of stress and absence of cruelty in the transportation of animals throughout the European Union.  If the matter is agreed at that meeting I expect the original ferry services will be back on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider there are strategic implications for us, as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, having inadequate ferry <Col N="1806" /> facilities to export &mdash; this also applies to imports &mdash; our goods and services and to have competitive access to our markets? Are there long term strategic implications for what was a pre-emptive strike by the ferry company in question in withdrawing its service?  If that were extended to other essential goods and services what would it mean for this country on the periphery of Europe which needs to import and export essential goods and services and to have competitive access to our markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's remarks.  Obviously, the fact that we are an island member state has implications. In relation to agriculture, particularly livestock, in the region of nine out of every ten steers or bullocks in the country are destined for the export market. Obviously a difficulty or constriction on the availability of ferry services to transport agricultural goods from Ireland has serious implications.  An interdepartmental group is examining this matter, particularly since the opening of the tunnel &mdash; I am not talking about the Cork tunnel.</P>

He also said that he has no difficulty whatever with the Irish standards but that on arrival on the Continent some of the land transport services are not up to standard in that they have inadequate rest periods, layerage and feeding and ventilation.  I am very insistent on uniform animal welfare systems throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>There is a long tradition of weanling and store trade in the west and north-west, particularly in Donegal, and it is my intenion to ensure that continues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 21, 24, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 39, 40, 41, 44, 48, 52, 55, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 67, 70, 76, 77, 78, 79, 88, 89, 94, 100, 104, 105, 107, 114, and 117 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> The eligible land requirement is a key element of the CAP reform arrangements for the arable sector.  Its objective is to prevent an expansion of the area under cereals and other arable crops in the EU by bringing into production land which had not previously been used for this type of production.  Such an expansion would have defeated one of the main objectives of the CAP reform, namely the control of surplus production. It would also have presented risks for traditional producers of these crops under the regional or national base area system, which provides for substantial penalties if these base areas are exceeded.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties which the eligible land requirement creates for Irish cereal producers, and in particular for those dependent on conacre land.  I am also concerned at the difficulties which this rule presents for the development of Irish cereal production in general, in view of the need to maintain adequate supplies of native grain to meet the feed requirements of the pig and poultry sectors.</P>
    <P>While I would not favour any fundamental changes to the CAP reform arrangements at this stage, I am seeking the removal of the eligible land requirement in the context of the individual base area system.  Under this system it would not be possible to increase the total area under arable crops, and the question of base area penalties would not arise.  The EU Commission has already been notified that the removal of the eligible land rule is an essential requirement if the IBA system is to be introduced.</P>
    <P>In relation to entitlement to IBAs, it should be noted that the CAP reform regulations make provision for a system of support for producers of arable crops.  This clearly implies that entitlement to IBAs must attach to producers of these crops during the base years which establish entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, however, of the fact that this will give rise to difficulties for some farmers who, due to domestic or <Col N="1816" /> financial circumstances, were out of production during the base years 1989 and 1991.  For that reason I am seeking provision in the IBA rules, which will permit the establishment of a national reserve.  It would be my intention to have a sufficient reserve to ensure that all genuine cases and the needs of new entrants could be satisfied.  Priority categories will be established in order to ensure that this aim is achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive response to what is becoming a very contentious issue.  Am I to take it from the reply that the Minister is committed to moving from a national base area to individual base areas with the abolition of the eligible land rule concept?  Assuming that interpretation is correct, will the Minister indicate how quickly that move will be made and when individual base areas rules on a national reserve will be available for inspection?  Will the Minister state clearly, when announcing the rules for access to a national reserve for individual base areas, the categories that will have automatic access to an individual base area when they wish to get back to cereal production?  I am thinking of widows who were not in a position in 1989-91 to grow crops and had to set their land, families who, through illness or bank pressure, were forced to set their land to service a debt and guarantee an income to a bank during those years and families who, perhaps through illness of the main farming partner, had to set their land until a son or daughter finished their education and were in a position to continue cereal production.</P>
      <P>Before agreement is reached on individual base areas in terms of a national reserve I would ask the Minister to state clearly that those categories, and any others that should be entitled to produce cereal, are spelled out and written down so that those families, when they are in a position to go back to cereal production, will be allowed do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my objective to move from the national base area and <Col N="1817" /> to move the eligible land clause.  I am aware of priority cases such as those mentioned by the Deputy.  A reasonable group in Waterford made a similar case to me.  I want to facilitate that group and the priority cases it brought to my attention, and that will be done before the final package is put in place.  In rural Ireland there is an ongoing difficulty with, for example, quota for milk producers and there is a fear that an inadequate reserve will be set up.  I will ensure there is an adequate reserve and that the priority cases who were unable during the critical years to establish a base area will be facilitated.</P>
      <P>From discussions with representatives of the National Grain Association of the major farming organisation, I know they see the equity of that proposal.  We put the proposal to the European Commission and as yet the Commission has not made a proposal to the Council of Ministers for negotiation with a view to putting in place a final package.  I hope that will be done sooner rather than later.  This matter has been under consideration for almost two years and the Commission has not yet found a resolution to the matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give people a guarantee that they will be covered by the national reserve?  If not, they will live in fear of being poverty sticken.  Many people let their land in 1989-91, and have been doing so for years because they are disabled or are not capable of working their land.  If the Minister cannot cater for those people, surely there is something very wrong with the system.  Can the Minister give us a guarantee that he will look after those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that they are looked after and protected.  As the Deputy is aware, it was decided to establish suckler cow <Col N="1818" /> and sheep reserves.  In regard to the sucker cow reserve, on the first distribution of additional quota, there was a surplus.  The same will apply in this case, that is, the national reserve will comprise of deductions from initial individual base area allocations and any remaining balance under the national base area allocation.  The reserve will be maintained by the confiscation of any base area rights not being availed of.  A considerable amount of land is not being used at present.  I have met the group in question and it has a reasonable case.  I have no difficulty in stating that it is my intention to ensure that it is looked after in the context of the national reserve which will be adequate to allow us facilitate priority or hardship cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister calculated an equation to see what is required and will this be met by the national reserve?  The Minister has made a comparison with the suckler cow reserve but the land involved in this case is much greater.  If the equation is not right many people will find themselves in poor circumstances.  Can the Minister give us a guarantee that every person who is eligible will be catered for under the national reserve?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The group I met outlined its position in a comprehensive document.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take heart from the Minister's response subject to clarification of how hardship cases and cases of natural justice will be automatically facilitated under the national reserve. Before he introduces IBAs and abolishes the eligible land requirement, will the Minister be in a position to spell out clearly in writing the IBA entitlements of those who, through no fault of their <Col N="1819" /> own, did not produce cereals on their land in 1989, 1990 and 1991?  Will the Minister be able to give a guarantee to those who, with a son or daughter, will want to get involved in cereal production at some time in the future that they will have an automatic right to do so under the national reserve; in other words, an entitlement to an IBA allocation in their own right even though they were not producers in 1989, 1990 or 1991 for the reasons we have given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution of this problem lies in the establishment of IBAs without the eligible land requirement. With such a package we should be able to ensure that the people we are talking about will be catered for adequately.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister share my concern, and that of many others, about under-production in the national base area at present?  What plans does he have to ensure that we will continue to have a viable cereal sector?  When, for example, will the IBA system be introduced?  Will it be introduced before the winter sowing of cereals next year or what timescale has he in mind? Will he consider making it public that he intends to abolish the eligible land requirement?  I have dealt with three cases during the past four months where farmers paid over and above the odds for agricultural land which is being advertised by auctioneers and sold at auction as being eligible land and is, therefore, commanding an asset value over and above its agricultural value. Those farmers do not as yet have an automatic entitlement to an IBA and if the Minister decides to abolish the eligible land requirement in the next 12 months a major injustice will have been done.  I have the names of farmers who have purchased land during the past few months and paid over the odds for it as it was advertised as being eligible land. Will the Minister advertise his intention to abolish the eligible land requirement so that auctioneers and farmers will understand the position and will not inadvertently find themselves in the same position as these farmers?  The Minister should make his intention clear.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 115, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, govern the welfare of all animals, including foxes, and the Garda Síochána is responsible for the enforcement of that legislation.  Anybody with information on acts of cruelty to foxes should not hesitate to contact the Garda.</P>
      <P>The maximum fine for offences of cruelty under the Acts was recently doubled from £500 to £1,000 by regulations which were made following discussion in the House.  The increased fine will act as a greater deterrent against illtreatment or abuse of animals.</P>
      <P>I am having the issues raised in these questions examined in my Department and I hope to come to an early conclusion in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State recollect that both he and the Minister gave a commitment to this House that they would not permit any unnecessary cruelty to animals to continue? Does he stand over and support the blooding of packs of young hounds with live fox cubs and accept that this activity is, apparently, extensive and deemed to be legal?  Is he prepared to stand over the use of terriers to terrify and kill foxes who have been dug out of their refuges?  Will he comment on whether that activity, which is deemed to be legal, is covered by the Protection of Animals Act to which he has referred?  Is he concerned that Ireland's image is being increasingly tarnished by exposés in foreign television documentaries &mdash; another of which we will see tonight &mdash; of organised abuse of our <Col N="1824" /> wildlife in both legal and illegal activities? What does he intend to do to rectify this dreadful situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has evidence of the blooding of young terriers I ask him to pass it on to the Garda Síochána.  The Deputy asked whether the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, apply to these activities but that has never been established in court and I am examining the powers under these Acts.  The Wildlife Act, 1976, which does not reside in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, does not list the fox as a protected species. The relevant experts are examining this area.  I want to get an overview of what is happening.  Much of the information which is being provided to the Department is anecdotal and generalised and I want to get a clear picture of what is happening on the ground.  The points raised by Deputy Gregory and others have been noted and the views of all Deputies will be taken into consideration. Following the process of consultation and having taken advice from the experts in my Department I hope to reach a conclusion at an early stage and will then take the action I deem appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's response is heartening.  However, does he not accept that the blooding of fox-hounds with live fox cubs, the so called practice of cubbing, and the use of terriers and terrier men who dig out the fox when he goes to ground are part and parcel of fox hunting as practised in this country and that it is not up to a Member to present evidence to the Minister on what is an accepted practice?  It is referred to indirectly in the constitution and powers of the Irish Master Fox-hounds Association when it refers to the use of terriers.  This is an accepted practice but if the Minister feels it is in contravention of the Protection of Animals Act, as I do, the Garda should be instructed to ascertain what precisely goes on at the end of a fox hunt and action should be then taken on that <Col N="1825" /> basis rather than on information that I or anybody else provides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not an enforcement agency and the legal position as to where responsibility for this lies is not altogether clear, but in the context of animal welfare I am prepared to accept responsibility and deal with it.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's points and I will consider them.  One person may say that he knows of a hunt that has never killed a fox in 12 years but I must have the full picture of what is happening and it is only in that context I can reach a balanced decision that takes account of animal welfare as well as rural sports.  I hope to reach a conclusion shortly.  The points made by all Deputies have been noted.</P>

We talk about REPS in the context of the landscape but rural sports have been part of rural life for many years and have their place. They serve as pastimes for people in rural areas and in many cases they provide a source of income.  I am not <Col N="1826" /> opposed to rural sports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, some 3,745 tillage farmers undertook to set-aside 36,753 hectares of arable land under the EU arable area aid scheme.  Payments began in October 1994 and are ongoing so final figures are not available.  It is estimated the EU funded subsidies in respect of set-aside totalling some £12.4 million will be paid.  This represents an average payment to each farmer of £3,300.</P>
      <P>Under the EU arable aid scheme, under which compensatory payments are made for eligible crops grown as well as land set-aside, total payments of £67.5 million have been applied for by 15,778 tillage farmers.  To date £42.5 million has been paid out to 12,743 of the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU regulations set-aside land may be used for the growing of crops for manufacture within the EU of products not primarily intended for human consumption.  A range of annual and perennial crops is permitted under the scheme but of most interest to us is oilseeds and sugar beet for the production of biofuels and pharmaceutical materials.  Forest trees with a short harvest cycle of ten years, may also be grown for the production of biomass for burning in power stations for energy. There is major interest in the EU in this scheme and this year the estimated area of crops sown for non-food purposes was 685,000 hectares, an increase of 160 per cent and the previous year.  While <Col N="1827" /> the use of set-aside land for non-food purposes has been relatively small in Ireland, I am encouraged by the development of a pilot project in the Leinster area where over 480 hectares of oilseeds have been grown for use in the pharmaceutical industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is very hard for the general public outside the agricultural sector to appreciate the reason for set-aside and the fact that farmers are getting considerable amounts of money for leaving land idle?  While it is certainly a preferable option to over production there is an onus on him to ensure that there is greater investment in alternative uses for this land such as biomass and biofuels. What does the Minister intend to do to ensure that the experimental work already being carried out by Teagasc is translated into real alternative use for set-aside land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McManus that there is considerable concern about setting aside land as a supply control policy.  The policy is in place, however, and we must make the best use of it by encouraging companies and co-operatives in the biofuels area. It is environmentally friendly and would have considerable economic and commercial value.  The Department had discussion with both Teagasc, who set up the pilot project, and the co-operative and a feasibility study is being carried out.  I hope that the much greater use of set aside land in the European Union is paralleled here and we will see far more environmentally friendly productive use of set aside land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says he wants to encourage this type of development, is he simply talking about extending words of encouragement or does he envisage the Department assisting in alternative use?  Also, when does the Minister expect the feasibility study to be completed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The encouragement is supported in a financial and tangible way by the EU in its ALTENER programme administered by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is encouraging the co-operatives in particular to take up the financial incentives in this programme.  With the co-operatives the Department is examining the possibility of developing a biofuel industry here and the feasibility studies are being carried out.  I expect that before the end of the year those studies will be completed and a report will be provided.  Nothing concrete has emerged so far and it is generally recognised that a biofuel programme could only succeed if substantial tax concessions were available.  That is obviously a matter for the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners but it is an area which is to be encouraged.  The fertile land set aside should be used for productive purposes to keep rural communities together, provide job opportunities and enhance the environmental amenity which exists in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the view that the good land left idle growing weeds which are cut once a year, and which is totally fallow is immoral.  It is totally alien to good farming practices. Will the Minister consider, for example, why a circus coming to a local rural town was refused permission to camp on set aside land?  That was considered against the rules.  Is there any sense in that?  If the farmer cannot use the land, it should at least be made available for recreational activity for the local community. Somebody should benefit from the land.  Why should a circus be refused permission to literally set up a tent on set aside land?  Why are pony clubs refused permission to have camps for local children on set aside land?  Why can set aside land taken out of production due to a surplus of products&mdash; we understand the theory if we do not like the practice &mdash; not be used for sport <Col N="1829" /> horse production and competition? Why can it not be used for any agricultural activity that is not in surplus and that will not cost the taxpayers of Europe anything?  I urge the Minister to allow a little common sense in the use of this land if it cannot be used for mainstream agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully that to the average person there are some nonsensical regulations and conditions applying to set aside land.  I am endeavouring to have many of those removed and while it is one thing to have an economic policy on supply control &mdash; and people might agree or disagree with it &mdash; the uses for that land should be examined and sensible proposals, such as those put forward by Deputy Doyle that will not increase the amount of surplus products, as the EU finds it, should obviously be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the question of biomass and biofuels, will the Minister agree that in the long term it is important to develop a national strategy in this area?  Is it the responsibility of his Department or the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to develop that kind of strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is the lead Department in this case and it is responsible for implementing EU programmes. Because my Department has a responsibility for the development of the land resource, we have an immediate interest in it and, along with Teagasc and the co-operatives, we are working with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to encourage better use of this set-aside land which would benefit the economy and the people living in rural Ireland in particular.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent report entitled Ireland's Forested Future published by An Taisce which expresses concern at the environmental impact of current afforestation patterns; in view of the report, the plans, if any, he has to promote the planting of broad-leaved trees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2769/94]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report in question, launched on Tuesday, 25 October.  I welcome the interest which organisations such as An Taisce, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Northern Ireland have in forestry and in its environmental compatibility, which is a specific element of our forestry programme.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledges that considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years but, as in any area, there is always room for improvement. With this in mind, the preparation of a strategic plan entitled The Strategy for the Forestry Sector to the year 2015, which I announced some months ago, will specifically address environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Indeed, a submission from An Taisce and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, along the lines of the current report, was among the many received from interested organisations and the general public and is being taken into account in the preparation of this report.</P>
      <P>In addition, work is now well advanced on a review of controls on the scale of forestry development, including planning controls, being undertaken by the Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of broadleaves, planting is being specifically encouraged by the very significant differential in favour of broadleaved species which is a feature of both our forestry grant and the forest premium schemes.  The current target is for broadleaves to represent 20 per cent of all planting.  Last year the average planting was about 10 per cent, an improvement on the 3 to 4 per cent of the 1980s, and a figure which I expect to be exceeded this year.  I might add <Col N="1831" /> that in the case of planting in 1993 by private landowners, predominantly farmers, the broadleaf component was 17 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response but the report from An Taisce is a cause of some concern.  The afforestation patterns now occurring according to the report, have serious implications for environmental protection. Is the Minister concerned that there is such a shortfall between the most recent proportion of broadleaved planting as opposed to the planting of coniferous trees.  Overall, the figures in the report are quite startling.  We have the fastest tree planting rate in these islands but only 3 per cent of tree plantings are broadleaved in comparison to Northern Ireland, where the figure is 8 per cent and 55 per cent in Great Britain.  I appreciate there have been improvements which are beginning to pay off but there remains a considerable shortfall between what is happening and the target set by An Taisce of 20 per cent to which the Minister referred.  Will he ensure that that target of 20 per cent is reached quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much favour the planting of broadleaves.  In fact, I am in receipt of an oak wood designation from Kilmolin in the Deputy's constituency. When I was appointed Minister I succeeded in getting a felling order for Coolattin Oak wood reversed and with the help of some far-sighted, sensible people in Wicklow, including Wicklow County Council, An Taisce and others, that wood is now a national asset.</P>
      <P>There is a nice oak wood in Glengarriff, County Cork.  In the preparation of the programme for afforestation, Deputies will note grant-aid favours broadleaved planting.  It takes a little longer for broadleaves to mature and farmers favour the more commercial species.  I do not like the rectangular plots of Norway spruce one sees around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an increase in broadleaved <Col N="1832" /> planting.  I have asked forestry workers and inspectors to meet with communities before planting takes place to ensure plantations are compatible with the environment and blend in with the natural terrain.  As regards the Department of the Environment and planning controls, I expect to have a report within the next three weeks which will ensure planting is carried out sensibly having regard to the natural environment.</P>
    <P>The afforestation programme is beginning to produce good commercial results in terms of employment and exports.  We still import a considerable amount of wood products.  Last year up to £400 million of wood products were imported.  I expect that within the next three or four years we will be self-sufficent and will have potential for major export.  A number of processing plants are coming on-stream.  Existing plants have been upgraded and forestry will provide a major portion of the agricultural rural economy in three or four years' time.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it clear to the House that it is not my function to make <i>ad hoc</i> interventions in industrial disputes. This House has seen fit to process legislation that provides adequate mechanisms such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court for parties to avail of and assist them to resolve disputes.  I would encourage parties to utilise these facilities where they have genuine and substantive difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the case of the current dispute the parties have held discussions under the auspices of the labour relations conciliation service.  However, as it was not possible for them to reach agreement, the commission has referred the dispute to the Labour Court.  The court is currently in contact with the parties regarding the possibility of arranging an early hearing.</P>

      <P>As regards the national folk collection, to the best of my knowledge the major artefacts are stored in the former reformatory at Daingean in County Offaly and are not available to the public.  The Minister indicated that he intends to introduce a national museums Bill and I presume such matters will be covered under it.  There is urgent need to collate and publish archive material.  I am sure most of it is not properly indexed.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are often criticised regarding heritage matters.  In recent years, due to financial constraints, they have not been able to look after important major buildings in their ownership.  However, they have attempted to preserve these buildings by and large.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputies refer to the heritage in their areas; an inventory was given of the heritage in counties Cavan, Wexford and others.  There was also a reference to the Ring Gaeltacht in County Waterford and the increased interest in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tremendous work has been carried out on the restoration of Ennis Abbey <Col N="1892" /> in County Clare.  Relatively modest sums of money have been spent in restoring this dilapidated abbey to a very beautiful building which can now be visited by the public.  The excellent lighting system installed in the abbey has considerably improved its appearance.</P>
    <P>There are numerous examples of co-operation between local communities and national bodies in refurbishing national monuments and improving access to them.  One example which springs to mind is Corcomroe Abbey in the Burren.  There was virtually no access to the abbey until the county council, in co-operation with local people, spent a substantial amount in improving access.  The abbey is now readily accessible and is on the visitor attraction list of many people.  Work is also being carried out on Quin Abbey which is a beautiful building and I hope this type of work will continue.</P>
    <P>The local authority in County Clare has experienced difficulties in maintaining large buildings, specifically courthouses.  I am not sure of the precise situation in regard to funding, but an undertaking was given two years ago that responsibility for funding these buildings would be taken over by the State.  There are several fine courthouses in the county and the ones with which I am most familiar are in Ennis, Tulla and Killaloe.  The Ennis courthouse is still used by the county council and is maintained at enormous cost. The dilapidated Tulla courthouse had a certain amount of money spent on it recently while the Killaloe courthouse has been vacant for a considerable period. I understand that local people intend to take an initiative in regard to the Killaloe courthouse.  This is the type of initiative An Comhairle Oidhreachta could support with advice, finance and encouragement.</P>
    <P>Michael Cusack, the founder of the GAA, was born in Carron, County Clare.  Some years ago his house was renovated by the GAA at a very considerable cost.  Despite excellent access, <Col N="1893" /> this house has been virtually closed for the past two years.  This part of our national heritage should be preserved by way of a substantial State input and it is unfortunate that having restored the house it should now be a fairly heavy burden on the GAA in County Clare.</P>
    <P>The county council has attempted to carry out preservation and restoration works at the Cliffs of Moher and to erect extra buildings.  While the vast majority of people support and welcome work of this nature, the people who appear to get the most coverage are stridently opposed to elements of what is proposed.  It will be interesting to see whether An Comhairle Oidhreachta can adjudicate on contentious matters.  From my experience of such matters, I would not wish this job on my worst enemy.  Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to have these matters addressed by an independent body.  I referred to the national folk collection, part of which could be displayed at the Bunratty Folk Park.  A group in Ennis put forward very specific proposals in this regard and will provide a premises in which the collection can be properly shown.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the excellent work carried out by local heritage bodies, archaeological and historical societies, etc.  The Clare Heritage Centre in Corofin, my native village, has been very successful and made much information available to the descendants of people who emigrated to Australia during the Famine.  This type of local effort demands substantial resources and it is very difficult to establish centres which will continue to fund themselves.  Last week there was a reference to the statement by the Kerry County Enterprise Board that there is an over-proliferation of such centres.  As Deputy Deasy said, local connection with people in other parts of the world must be preserved <Col N="1894" /> and developed.  An Comhairle Oidhreachta will have a difficult task if it takes on this job.</P>
    <P>A fairly important stone object has disappeared from the graveyard in the grounds of the old church in Gleninagh. I also understand that a very important grave slab was damaged during the installation of a new headstone at the old church in Kilnaboy.  It is very difficult for a heritage council or other national body to ensure that relatively small stone objects are not removed from graveyards or that people do not damage artefacts.  Nevertheless, it is important that they make a definite attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brendan Smith referred to the substantial level of funding for natural and cultural tourism under the tourism operational programme.  A sum of £25 million will be administered by the Minister's Department and I presume An Comhairle Oidhreachta will have a very specific role in determining the projects to be grant-aided under the programme.  There is a proposal to construct a large folk music centre in County Clare.  The people involved in this project have spoken to me and have been in contact with the Department. Music is a very important part of our heritage and must be preserved, encouraged and made available to the public and visitors.  I would like to see this type of centre developed in an area with a very strong folk music tradition. Nobody would take on County Clare in this regard with any great hope of success.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the EU heritage conservation programme under which specific projects are funded each year.  To the best of my knowledge the performing arts were covered under this programme in 1994 while the 1995 programme will support the restoration of religious objects in churches etc.  I am interested in hearing if the council will disburse funding for such projects under the cultural action of DG10.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> Our national games are also part of our heritage.  The GAA has successfully developed these games which have proven to be very lucrative.  This area comes under threat from time to time and it may require specific support in certain areas.  I referred earlier to the Irish language which to some extent has its own national body.  Many people work on a voluntary basis to support the development of the language and I would like them to be given more support than they have been given up to now.</P>

      <P>On the face of it, this Bill sets out to put in place a number of measures to improve the protection of our heritage and to promote our knowledge and understanding of it.  Those are objectives we would all support but on closer inspection I find the Bill has a number of objectionable features which I intend to examine.  It could fairly be described as a rather vainglorious exercise in unfettered ministerial control <Col N="1896" /> when we come to look at the schedule that deals with the Heritage Council.  I know the Minister does not want it called a Heritage Council; he wants it called An Comhairle Oidhreachta.  If so why did he not have one Irish title on the Bill and leave out the rest?</P>
      <P>When we look at it we find that it is a vehicle designed to give the Minister total control over who will be on this council and a substantial degree of control over what it does.  That is in keeping with the Minister's character.  We should ask the Minister &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, would convey this to him &mdash; to reflect a little more on how vulnerable he is when he goes about that.</P>
      <P>I recall one of the contributions by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, to the culture and heritage of future generations.  It was a little poem published in that weird and wonderful interval between the last general election and the moment the Labour Party finally succumbed to the seductions and blandishments of Fianna Fáil &mdash; a surrender the Labour Party has come to regret because it discovered very quickly that Fianna Fáil did not respect it the following morning and has not shown much respect for it ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Higgins, had previously written a poem which was sharp observation of what goes on when a Minister for Education &mdash; a woman &mdash; goes to visit a school.  I do not know which Minister for Education he meant, whether it was the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment or a previous Minister for Education.  One of the sharp observations in the poem was the instruction by the nun in charge of the assembled children: &ldquo;Clap, children, clap&rdquo;, as the Minister gets out of her car.  It may be that the Minister regrets having had that poem published.  From observation I can tell the House that there is no time <Col N="1897" /> the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht blossoms so well as when he arrives at a venue to be welcomed with rapturous applause by a crowd of leftwing Labour Party psychophants masquerading as literary or cultural glitterai. We find the same type of bombast in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I looked to the Minister's speech in search of more substance than the total diktat of ministerial control but I did not find it.  Instead, I find even less enlightenment about how this Bill will operate than I do in the Bill.  In his introductory speech the Minister described Oidhreacht as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oidhreacht&rdquo; should not be seen as a purely passive concept; it can also be an instrument of economic development if the linkages between development and the social and cultural patterns of the community are sensitively made.</P>
    <P>I read that a second time and I said: &ldquo;Mother of God&rdquo;&mdash; or words to that effect &mdash; what does that mean?  What are the linkages between development and the social and cultural patterns of the community?  What are they and how are they to be sensitively made rather than made in any other way?  The Minister goes on to talk about building an awareness of heritage among the Irish people and goes on to define it a little more as follows:</P>
    <P>This is a kind of generic heritage or cultural policy which has an economic consequence that is beneficial.  This is my new approach to heritage.  It is not simply a matter of seeing these places as tourist centres or as magnets but rather as places of immense interest which people locally know and respect and want to share with other people.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of generic heritage the Minister is talking about.  I have news for the Minister.  If the Minister thinks that that is a new approach to heritage he has another think coming.  That has <Col N="1898" /> been the approach of most of us to heritage for a long time.  The rest of us will welcome the Minister on board if he means it when he says: &ldquo;This is my new approach to heritage&rdquo;.  That is how most of us have always seen it and the Minister has not said anything particularly new.  He goes on to speak about the central role of his Department in relation to the development of policy on decentralisation and the implementation of that policy.  This is in his introduction to a Bill which puts entirely in the hands of the Minister the appointment of An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, the appointment of a substantial proportion of the members of the two standing committees of that council and the firing of members of that council.</P>
    <P>Those reflections make a nonsense of what the Minister bombastically claims to be his new policy on heritage and his decentralised approach to its implementation. The Minister let his slip show once or twice during his speech.  I read carefully the passage in which he referred to the Office of Public Works and concluded that the battle between the Minister and the Minister of State and the Office of Public Works has not been resolved.  There is probably a more active and bloody war going on in the background over that piece of turf than the Minister is prepared to admit in public.</P>
    <P>Will he explain his definition of heritage? He defined it as including &ldquo;all those elements of Irish life today which have survived from the past and whose continuing survival into future generations depends on the attitudes and actions of the present&rdquo;.  That is quite a mouthful.  I have heard the Minister say on other occasions that there are elements of Irish life today &mdash; if I may borrow his words &mdash; which have survived from the past and which he would like to eradicate.  When the Minister was giving us a bombastic account of this jackboot type Bill, in terms of the <Col N="1899" /> appointment of members of the council, he forgot all that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this Government, who claims to want openness, consultation and partnership, introducing legislation which leaves the hiring and firing of every member of a heritage council in the hands of the Minister without provision for consultation with anybody else.  That is contrary to what was provided for in the two previous Acts which the Minister is proposing to repeal in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central instrument of this newly discovered heritage policy &mdash; something which the Minister has newly discovered but about which the rest of us have always known &mdash; is to be called An Chomhairle Oidhreachta.  The Government has chosen a peculiar way of going about this.  The Bill makes An Chomhairle Oidhreachta the personal fief of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  On reading the Schedule, which sets out the function and method of appointment of An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, I was amazed at how it will be set up.  Paragraph 1 (2) of the Schedule states &ldquo;The chairperson and the ordinary members shall be appointed by the Minister&rdquo;.  He has a <Col N="1901" /> great penchant for appointing people with whom he has been friendly in the past and who share a good deal of his philosophical orientations.  Paragraph 2 (2) of the Schedule states, &ldquo;Each member of the council shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has an interest in or knowledge or experience of or in relation to the national heritage&rdquo;. Again, the appointment of members of the council will depend entirely on the Minister.  How will he exercise that function?  Other Members expressed the hope that the Minister will appoint suitable qualified people who empathise with what the Bill proposes, but the Bill does not contain a requirement to that effect.  The Minister can appoint any cat, dog or devil he likes.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the qualifications that are involved.  People in the opinion of the Minister, have an interest in or knowledge or experience of or in relation to the national heritage will be appointed.  That could involve the 3.6 million people who live in the Republic or 5 million if the Minister extends it to the population of the entire island.  I would qualify for a position on the council as I have an interest in, a knowledge and experience of and in relation to our national heritage.  The Bill does not guide us in relation to the type of people the Minister will appoint to the council, nor will this House have control over the people he appoints.  This will be a fiefdom of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of the Schedule states that the Minister may, at any time, remove from office the chairperson or any member of the council, or any person appointed by the Minister to a committee of the council where such removal appears necessary for the effective performance by the council &mdash; or committee &mdash; of its functions.  To whom must it appear necessary?  Does that mean it must appear necessary to the Minister?  That provision allows the <Col N="1902" /> Minister to fire members of An Comhairle Oidhreachta or the standing committees if in his view it is necessary to remove such persons for the effective performance by the council, or a committee, of its functions.  That is entirely arbitrary.  The Minister does not have to explain it to An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, to his Department, to this House or to the public.  When one recalls some of the Minister's comments about people who do not agree with him, members of An Chomhairle Oidhreachta who hold a different view from that of the Minister had better watch out because this provision gives the Minister unfettered and unqualified power to fire such persons from the board.  The Minister may shake his head, but he objects to hired guns in Sunday newspapers having the temerity to disagree with his party in Government.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the heritage council will be entirely in the hands and at the bidding of the Minister. That contrasts with what was done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill repeals section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, which set up the Historic Monuments Council. Before Committee Stage I should like the Minister to re-read the Act and reflect on it because section 4 (3) sets out the balance of membership of the Historic Monuments Council and a list <Col N="1903" /> of bodies from among whose representatives members of that council would be selected.  They include the three Colleges of the National University, Trinity College, Dublin, Queen's University in Belfast, Bord Fáilte Éireann, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and the Maritime Institute of Ireland.  These people are to be consulted.  Just before that there is a list of representatives &mdash; members of the council who shall be appointed from time to time as occasion requires by the Minister and shall consist of a representative each of the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Marine, the Minister for the Environment and the Commissioners, which I take to be a reference to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Therefore, there was consultation in the case of one of the bodies to be replaced by this new council.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 4 of this Bill to repeal section 13 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, the Act which established the Wildlife Advisory Council but which did not go as far in terms of consultation and involvement of other bodies as one might have wished.  Of course, the Labour Party was in Government with a different partner when that Act was passed, a partner that did not seem to kick it in the teeth quite as often as Fianna Fáil seems to do now.  Section 13 (6) of Wildlife Act, 1976, states: &ldquo;Before making an order under this section which contains provisions relating to the constitution of the Council, the Minister shall consult any other Minister of State or a body established by or regulated under statute considered by the Minister to be concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The provisions of that Act also provided for consultation.  In fact those two Acts provided avenues by which the Minister of the day would consult and be at least advised by, if not guided by, something other than the particular <Col N="1904" /> manifestation of the Holy Spirit that descended on him.  The Minister present does not need any Holy Spirit; he does not need any consultation; he does not need advice from anybody else, he will do it all himself, will appoint and fire members of the council as it pleases him.  I do not like that, not because I distrust the Minister personally &mdash; I disagree with him about many things, I am sure he will make choices with which I will not agree, and I do not impute any bad motives to him &mdash; but his record makes me worry.  I find it incredible that a Government that pays so much lip service to open Government, to consultation, to partnership should come into this House and advance a proposal of this kind for setting up such a personal fiefdom of any Minister, especially, when the Minister in question has never been beaten for the piousity with which he can present his ideas to the general public.  I do not like that provision.  I find that part of this Bill entirely objectionable and would like the Minister to seriously reflect on it before Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Section 10 deals with the action, or approach to be taken by An Comhairle Oidhreachta to heritage buildings owned by a public authority, which is entirely commendable.  If this section becomes law, can the Minister tell us whether it will save Longford courthouse?  Will he be able to prevent Longford County Council from doing <Col N="1905" /> something dreadful to Longford courthouse? If not I urge the Minister to talk to his partners in Government, and get them to stop their local yahoos from sealing the fate of that building.  I know there are problems about who owns, or who has rights to part of its basement, which delicacy forbids me from trespassing on here.  Will the Minister tell us whether that is one of the problems that might be solved if the provisions of this section are implemented?</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to another of my concerns.  Immediately on reading that section I wondered whether there was any provision for what might be done in respect of heritage buildings not in public ownership. What the Minister had to say about that was that it was too complex a matter to be gone into now, that he would have to think about it again in the future.  I urge the Minister to give it rapid consideration, to ask his manifestation of the Holy Spirit to advise him on it fairly quickly because a few important matters arise about which other Members have spoken.  I shall not repeat their comments.</P>
      <P>I might add a few reflections, including one that occurs to me immediately. On my frequent drives to Limerick I pass somewhere near Borris-in-Ossory &mdash; I cannot remember the name of the townland &mdash; an old Norman castle keep, probably a 12th or 13th century building that for some time had been integrated into a farmyard, or a farmyard built around it.  I had the pleasure of talking to its owners on the last occasion there was a by-election in Laoighis-Offaly.  In recent years that castle keep has been restored and a great deal of work done to it.  It has been fitted out and furnished inside in a manner representing the period in which it was constructed and is open to the public.  That is entirely commendable. I am sure the Minister sees a good many of them in his constituency and in the southern part of the country &mdash;<i>Dal Gcais</i> is littered with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> There are many places where one will find today an old Norman keep, usually a tower building, where the original bawn has become a farmyard.  To my inexpert eye many of them, externally at least, are in reasonably sound physical condition but nothing remains of the interior.  They are all private property. A great many people who own such buildings would quail at the thought of what would be required to be spent to make anything of them.  The Minister knows that in his constituency a number of such keeps have been fitted out as places of entertainment, even as private residences, and it costs a lot of money to do it.  A great many of them are extant on our landscape.  An effort should be made at least to preserve what remains of them, if not to restore them to their original condition.  There is a difficulty in that they are now private property but that is something on which we should act fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is worried about heritage buildings, now private property and their preservation perhaps he would talk to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and endeavour to persuade him to adopt a more flexible view of the tax concessions being given for the upkeep of such buildings.  A change was effected in this year's Finance Act which was not as draconian as that originally proposed but still constitutes a burden on some of the owners of those houses who find them very difficult to maintain but which they must do to gain the tax advantage given, quite rightly, to preserve the fabric of those buildings.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to speak to his colleague in charge of law reform and repeat to him most urgently, and as sincerely as he can manage, what other Members of the House have said to him today, which I fully support, about the Occupiers' Liability Bill.  The Bill published is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the problem.  Nor is it a satisfactory way of dealing with the problem faced by landowners who have <Col N="1907" /> historic monuments or other objects on their lands which people want to see and which we would all want to see if we succeed in joining the Minister in his rather pretentious crusade to make the linkages between development and the social and cultural patterns of the community sensitively.  Some day I must ask the Minister to explain just what he meant by that; it is a dreadful piece of literary gunge.</P>
    <P>A number of definitions in the Bill puzzle me.  If the Minister could explain them a little now it might save us much time on Committee Stage.  In the definition of &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; there is a reference to buildings or parts of buildings habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes. I wonder why habitual use for ecclesiastical purposes is particularly mentioned.  Could the Minister explain why the definition of &ldquo;fauna&rdquo; includes only &ldquo;fish and such aquatic invertebrate animals of a species specified in regulations under section 3 of the Wildlife Act&rdquo;?  Why is it limited in that way?  It is not obvious that it is entirely necessary to do that.  Again we come back to the question of the use of buildings for ecclesiastical purposes in the definition of a monument.  The definition of a monument, if I follow it correctly, does not include any building or part of any building habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes.</P>
    <P>Is it wise to define a wildlife habitat as &ldquo;the ecological environment in which particular organisms and communities thereof thrive&rdquo;?  Given that so many of these habitats are under threat, we should define those habitats for the purposes of the action contemplated here, as places where those organisms or communities thereof live rather than thrive, because there could be arguments about thriving.  There are some places where some of the organisms or colonies are not thriving, where they are in danger of extinction and where, if we are serious about what is set out in this <Col N="1908" /> Bill, we should be trying to preserve them from extinction.</P>
    <P>The final point, and I would like to conclude on this because it is the one point on which I feel I can unambiguously and honestly congratulate the Minister, is that I am delighted to see that where this Bill makes provision for orders to be made it uses the procedure under which drafts of orders are submitted to the two Houses of the Oireachtas, and the order is not made until the Houses of the Oireachtas have actually approved them.  The Minister is right to go down that road.  I commend him on it and I hope that part of the Minister's thinking &mdash; not the rest, God forbid &mdash; will spread rapidly to his colleagues in Cabinet.  Then we might begin to get something like the democracy which the Government likes to give itself the appearance of.</P>

      <P>Later I will say something about Deputy Dukess' negative performance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on putting the protection of our national heritage on a statutory footing.  I am particularly glad that the Minister is proposing to establish standing committees under the new legislation to deal with the protection of our wildlife and wildlife habitats.</P>
      <P>Ireland has, in recent years, developed a very unsavoury reputation for blood sports of a particularly cruel kind relating to some of our wild animals and birds.  Badger-baiting, foxhunting, hare coursing, the blooding of greyhounds with live rabbits and cockfighting are gruesome activities.  Indeed, tonight the BBC &ldquo;Spotlight&rdquo; programme is showing a documentary on Northern Ireland which relates how fighting cocks and spurs are sold in Smithfield at the monthly horse fair in my constituency.  These activities are indefensible and I trust that the new council will tackle them as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the adjournment.  It is no joy for me to relate the horrific accident to an 11 year old boy in Mullingar who, as a result of an accident with fireworks, is now hospitalised and in danger of losing the sight of one of his eyes.  Another boy in Athlone suffered severe hand injuries from an exploding firework about a week ago.  Those are just two of the incidents in Westmeath alone, but I understand there were many more accidents around the country leading to serious injury and permanent scarring and maiming.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with the Eye and Ear Hospital and they tell me that over the weekend they had eight admissions with eye injuries.  Five people have now gone home but will need treatment for some time.  Three people suffered major injuries.  One has had surgery already and will possibly recover.  Another was injured by a blunt object hitting his eye. It will take several months of treatment to get his eyesight back, if at all.  The third has also had major surgery and is in a very serious condition.  Those are just some of the eye injuries we know about.  There are several other injuries to hands, fingers, legs, etc. which we have not recorded yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coupled with those incidents are the countless people, particularly the elderly, who live in fear of Hallowe'en and the possible terror that will surround them.  Bangers being thrown at their windows and doors and put in their letterboxes serve to make many people wish Hollowe'en would revert to being <Col N="1910" /> a feast celebrated with apples, nuts and barm brack.</P>
    <P>Despite fireworks being illegal in Ireland approximately £116,000 worth were seized by the Garda last year.  Several prosecutions were taken for possession and also for trading in fireworks but to no avail.  This year we saw an even greater amount of fireworks available than ever before.  In Mullingar the dogs in the street were aware of the family selling fireworks.  This well known family, who have had many brushes with the law on several other fronts, were almost openly selling fireworks from their home.  They had a huge volume of them and this is evidenced by a seizure made in that area. Fireworks to the value of over £700 were confiscated &mdash; 18 boxes of black cat bangers, 283 rockets, 250 plane drop rockets, one box of assorted rockets and four cartwheels.  Those are just some of the items confiscated in raids.</P>
    <P>Because fireworks are illegal they are handled and stored covertly with little regard for conditions of storage, best method of handling and conditions of use.  Fireworks contain a certain amount of explosives and to handle explosives properly one needs to be expert and there are many conditions as to how fireworks are used and stored.  None of those seem to apply when fireworks are held illegally.  The laws in this area are antiquated, relying on legislation from 1875 and 1883 with fines of up to £5 for throwing fireworks.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's responsibility to take control in this area and take the necessary action to prevent these instruments of injury and death, sometimes thought of as toys, getting into the hands of children and causing some of the problems I related earlier.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a matter which should be of concern to us all, particularly as it involves <Col N="1911" /> in many cases hurt and injury to innocent young people.  I am well aware of the case referred to where a young boy suffered severe injuries to his eye on what should have been a night of fun and games.  The Deputy is quite right when he said that there is a need for tight controls on the availability of fireworks and I am glad to have this opportunity to set out the position in relation to the importation of fireworks.</P>
      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875 a licence is required to be issued by the Department of Justice for the importation of fireworks.  It is long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised firework displays conducted by competent professional operators. Under such controlled conditions, injury and mishap is a rarity and rarely detracts from the enjoyment of the spectacle.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately not all firework displays are so controlled and many fireworks are entering the country illegally and are finding their way into the hands of young people in particular.  Much of what comes into the country in that way is of dubious quality and it is a particular problem at this time of the year. Unscrupulous individuals seek to flood the market with as many of these fireworks as they can sell in order to make a quick profit, with no regard whatever for the safety of young people who use those fireworks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is satisfied that seizure by the gardaí is the best way of protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks.  It is important to point out that the gardaí, as enforcers of the law, have taken strong measures to ensure that as many illegally imported fireworks as possible are confiscated.  They have done this by setting up of a special Garda unit in Dublin to combat the sale and distribution of illegally imported fireworks; the deployment of personnel to known trouble areas to deal specifically with <Col N="1912" /> the problem; liaison with local authorities and the fire brigade service.</P>
    <P>They also issued warnings on the dangers connected to fires and fireworks on local radio stations leading up to Hallowe'en. A close eye is kept by the Garda Síochána on this illegal trade and they do not hesitate to act when necessary. Moreover, the Deputy might like to note that the gardaí have had some very good successes in recent years, when it comes to confiscation of illegally imported fireworks.  As Deputy McGrath rightly pointed out, in 1993 a total of £116,000 worth were seized and subsequently destroyed and this year, in an even greater push against those traders, the gardaí in Dublin rounded up a total of £120,000 worth of illegally imported fireworks.  In one area of Dublin, namely, Henry Street, £65,000 worth of illegal fireworks were seized during the month of October alone.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us all to take a share of the responsibility in relation to this problem.  Vigilance cannot be left to the gardaí alone and parents in particular, and adults in general, should ensure that their children are aware of the dangers posed by fireworks and that if they know their children are using or are in the company of those who are using fireworks of any description that they are supervised.</P>
    <P>Far too often the type of dreadful accident which occurred in Mullingar and which was referred to by Deputy McGrath comes about through children being left to their own devices with fireworks and at bonfires with no adults in supervision.  That particular incident was one of many which happen too regularly and for the boy in question it will have a devastating effect on him for the rest of his life.  We can all help to make it a safer, happier, time for our children and young people.</P>
    <P>For their part, I have no doubt that the gardaí will take all necessary steps to deal with this illegal trade to ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that as <Col N="1913" /> many illegally imported fireworks as possible are confiscated and destroyed and do not find their way onto the streets.  It is only through vigilance by all adults that the tragedies we read about in our newspapers at this time of year are kept to an absolute minimum and that everyone, young and old, has the opportunity to enjoy what should be a happy, joyful occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It was brought to my attention by Deputy Allen in the context of the predecessor of the present Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication, Deputy Cowen, who introduced a ministerial policy directive to all State bodies in 1992.  It arises specifically from the sale last month of a railway yard by CIE at Horgan's Quay in Cork.  It would appear that valuable yard was sold privately by CIE to a developer despite an obligation on the company to sell by tender or auction.  I would like the Minister to deal with four specific points and I thank him for coming into the House to reply to this matter.</P>
      <P>Why did CIE sell a site comprising railway tracks and platforms when the 1950 and 1987 Transport Acts explicitly state that such track can only be sold to adjacent landowners or by public auction or tender?  Why did CIE ignore the 1992 guidelines for State bodies which explicitly state that competitive tendering should be normal procedure in State bodies, save in exceptional circumstances? It is not good enough for an anonymous CIE spokesman to say that those guidelines only apply to the purchase of goods by State companies. The principle is always the same, namely, that State companies should get maximum value for taxpayers' money whether buying or selling property or other goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> What, if any, was the Taoiseach's personal involvement in that deal?  I understand that a local Fianna Fáil Deputy is on record as praising the Taoiseach's hands-on approach to the sale.  What does that mean?  If the Taoiseach was involved in the sale that would amount to political interference and if he was not involved the Fianna Fáil Deputy concerned, who commended the Taoiseach's hands-on approach, should deny any such involvement and clarify the position.</P>
    <P>As CIE knew that at least two developers were interested in acquiring that site why was one of those excluded from tendering or not told the site was on the market?  As the Minister is aware, if two potential buyers emerge when selling one's home the best price will be obtained through auction or tender. Why did CIE ignore basic common and commercial sense in regard to that sale? There has been a cloud of confusion over the sale of that CIE yard and I would like the Minister to deal with the specific points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines to which the Deputy referred were issued to all commercial semiState bodies by their respective Ministers in the course of 1992.  The guidelines include a requirement that each body confirm to the relevant Minister, on an annual basis, that they are being fully implemented.  I have received the necessary assurances from the chairman of CIE in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines deal generally with the proper conduct of the business of commercial State bodies and the proper control of functions exercised by the boards of such bodies.  While the guidelines deal specifically with competitive tendering procedures to be followed by State bodies when placing significant contracts for construction work and for the purchase of goods and services, as opposed to the disposal of assets by <Col N="1915" /> State bodies, the general thrust of the guidelines makes it clear that in all of their commercial dealings, these bodies are expected to follow procedures which will optimise the interests of the shareholder, in other words, the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the property to which the Deputy referred, perhaps I should first indicate the statutory position.  In the case of land which becomes surplus to requirements as a direct result of the formal process of abandonment of railway lines, there are specific procedures laid down in the Transport Acts for the disposal of such land.  However, the property in question at Kent Railway Station in Cork does not fall into that category.  More generally, the position is that under the Transport Acts, the <Col N="1916" /> board of CIE may dispose, whether absolutely or for a term of years or for any lesser period, of any property which in the opinion of the board is not required by it for the discharge of its duties.  In other words, disposal of property is a matter for the board of the CIE Group and not the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by CIE that from its point of view all appropriate steps to ensure optimisation of the realisable value of assets have been followed in the case of the property in Cork.  My Department is currently in contact with the CIE Group on the details of those steps.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 November 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 154 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> The detailed information sought by the Deputies is set out in a tabular statement which is being circulated in the Official Report.  In view of the higher employment and added-value derived from the export of beef and the longer term development of the beef sector in Ireland, it is in the national interest to encourage the export of beef rather than live animals.  However, I accept that the export of live animals provides for greater competition in the market place although it is not possible to gauge precisely the volume of live exports required for that purpose since that volume would vary from time to time with market circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards incentives to encourage cattle slaughtering, the Government already provides a generous range of State grants for investment in plant and machinery, for research and for market promotion by the beef processing sector. These grants are supplemented by the EU through the Structural Funds. Furthermore, a slaughter premium worth £58.58 per head is payable on all steers slaughtered in Ireland between 1 January and 30 April.  Finally, it is Government policy to ensure that EU support mechanisms provide effective encouragement for the export of beef in processed form.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 45, 49, 66 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Leader 1 programme continues to the end of the year, it is not possible to give the exact amount that will be paid to promoters of projects. On the basis of information supplied by the groups.  Who say that all the available money which has been committed to projects will be drawn down, in the region of £30.5 million is likely to be paid.  A feature of all grant aid schemes <Col N="1838" /> is that some promoters of projects are unable to draw down the moneys committed to them for a variety of reasons such as failure to proceed with the project or the ineligibility of some of the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The report of the evaluation of Leader 1 by independent consultants was published some months ago.  The report indicated that the programme had attained a considerable degree of success in terms of the achievement of its objectives, the enormous commitment of board members, support structures and local communities, the dedication and enthusiasm of its management, the positive and constructive relationship between groups and my Department, and the support and participation of the State agencies an local authorities.</P>
    <P>Among its findings were:  While Leader is a relatively small measure, in terms of total public expenditure related directly or indirectly to rural development, it afforded the first opportunity for most Groups to examine the potential of their own areas, to co-operate their efforts and co-ordinate their activities in devising and implementing an innovative local development strategy for the betterment of their communities.</P>
    <P>Availability of matching funds did not feature as a significant problem for Group projects, with the exception of the training measure.</P>
    <P>In total, Groups had committed funds to over 2,350 projects (the outturn could well be close to 2,800 projects).</P>
    <P>In terms of Leader measures, the average Group had allocated about 44 per cent of its total projects to the Rural Tourism measure; 18 per cent and 15 per cent to the Small Enterprise and Natural Resource measures respectively.  In terms of Leader expenditure, the corresponding allocations are 51 per cent, 20 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> In terms of the gender of promoters, the average Group had about twice as many male as female promoters.</P>
    <P>The average Leader grant is about IR£13,400 for all Groups and the range across Groups is from IR£5,000 to about IR£27,000.</P>
    <P>Claimed actual employment (Full-Time Equivalents) attributable to Leader is 1,445.  The proportion of total persons employed part-time and seasonally by the average Group is about 60 per cent and the proportion of females employed is reported at just under 40 per cent.  Some of the Groups claim employment levels which appear excessive relative to the public expenditure outlay and a significant downward adjustment on the previously cited aggregate is warranted.</P>
    <P>Promoters were generally very positive in their attitude towards Leader especially as regards the local area-based nature if the Initiative and the perceived &ldquo;approachability&rdquo; of the Boards and management.</P>
    <P>The diversity of Leader areas in terms of size, resource endowment, degree of overlap across county boundaries, and prior experience of the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach to local development, has provided an opportunity to consider the most appropriate structures that allow for diversity. </P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report including those relating to the administration of the programme by my Department and the establishment of a representative central Leader partnership board, are being considered in the context of our preparations for Leader II.</P>
    <P>As regards Leader II, the position is that an initial £37 million was allocated by the European Commission to implement the programme here.  I am now pleased to say that the Commission is making available an additional £17 million for the programme bringing the total EU contribution for Leader II in <Col N="1840" /> Ireland to £54 million.  The EU moneys will, of course, be supplemented by an Exchequer contribution still to be decided.</P>
    <P>Additionally, a total of £1.1 billion has been retained by the Commission as a reserve during the period to 1999. Ireland can expect its share of this reserve in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated in my reply to a number of written questions during October, a total of 48 business plans have been received from applicant groups for Leader II.  I will be having these evaluated over the coming months with the help of independent consultants, in parallel with the negotiations with the European Commission on our Operational Programme which was submitted to Brussels last week, with a view to ensuring the earliest selection of the successful groups.  In view of the fairly lengthy procedures involved, an announcement about the successful groups cannot be expected until early in 1995.  All the proposals will be considered on their merits and it would be inappropriate for me to give a commitment to any particular Leader group at this stage.</P>

      <P>To assist local offices in answering farmers' queries and to ensure that the most up-to-date information is available at local offices, an on-line computer system has been installed in local offices during the year.  This system is now up and running and allows those offices to be linked to the central computer, to input pay directions directly to that computer without having to forward batches in the post to Dublin and to access that computer directly to see how each pay direction input is progressing and when payment is completed.</P>
      <P>Farmers have of course been dealing with their local offices for years past and in most cases are able to get the information they require on their headage and premia payments.  I am confident this new system of direct access by my Department's local offices to the mainframe computer in Dublin will enable those offices to improve their service to farmers in future.</P>

    <P>In a situation where the number of <Col N="1842" /> applications under the headage and premia schemes arose from 370,000 in 1992 to some 640,000 in 1993 and where new EU regulations of great complexity were introduced in 1993 my Department did have some difficulties in making payments in as timely a manner as I would have wished.  Ireland was not alone in having these difficulties.  It was a feature in all member states but the facts show that in Ireland we managed to cope with the difficulties as well as, or better than, other EU member states.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1993, for example, my Department had paid out some £50 million to suckler cow and special beef premium applicants while no payments had been made in up to half of the other member states.  Considerable levels of payment were also achieved under other 1993 schemes by the end of 1993 with up to 85 per cent of headage claimants in receipt of payments.  Ireland's delivery of 40 per cent balancing payments under 1993 schemes was also creditable and well ahead of the performance in a number of member states. I believe that my Department's performance in making payments in 1993 would be judged in a favourable light by any reasonable and objective commentator. The payment level of £377 million achieved in 1993 was an all-time record. That is not to say, however, that I was satisfied with the progress that was made.  Given the increased importance of headage and premia payments to farmers' incomes, I am committed to the continued improvement and streamlining of the systems within my Department.</P>
    <P>Extra resources amounting to £4.8 million have been made available by the Government this year with this in mind and major investment in computerisation has been carried out in the local offices as I have already indicated and additional staff have been put in place. The improvements introduced in our payments programme for 1994 will ensure the delivery of the CAP compensatory payments this year in line with the commitment entered into with <Col N="1843" /> the farming bodies in the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work.</i>  The additional resources for headage payments provided by the Government this year again in fulfilment of the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work</i> commitment is allowing 85 per cent advance payments to be made by comparison with the norm of 60 per cent in 1993.  The improvements have already borne fruit with some 98 per cent and 95 per cent of applicants under 1994 ewe premium and deseasonalisation slaughter premium schemes respectively in receipt of payments to date.  Ireland was one of only two member states to commence 1994 ewe premium payments in July.  By the end of August last, 95 per cent of Irish applicants had received ewe premium payments.  At that time, only one other member state had still made any significant payments.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1994 arable aid scheme commenced on 18 October and to-date almost £43 million has been paid to 81 per cent of applicants.  Payments have now commenced under headage, special beef and suckler cow schemes, up to three weeks ahead of 1993. Already over 122,000 payments totalling some £90 million have been made under these schemes.  When payments under all 1994 headage and premium schemes, including arable aid, ewe premium and deseasonalisation premium are taken into account, some £212 million has now been paid.  These figures should give assurance of my commitment to the earliest delivery of payments to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's national base area of 345,000 hectares represents the maximum area for which arable area payments can be made, not only for cereals, but also for oilseeds, <Col N="1845" /> protein crops and set-aside.  In addition, land used to grow cereals and the other eligible crops, but declared as forage area for the purpose of the livestock premia schemes, is included in this maximum.</P>
      <P>The total area of eligible arable crops and set-aside for which area-linked payments were claimed in 1994 was 310,214 hectares.  This included 262,811 hectares of cereals.  It also included 36,753 hectares of set-aside land, virtually all of which would have related to cereal crops.</P>
      <P>The combined area under cereals and in set-aside in 1994 was 299,634 hectares. This compares with the 1991 Census of Agriculture figure for cereals, of 301,500 hectares.  It is clear, therefore, that set-aside was the main contributory factor in the reduced cereals area and consequently reduced production. However, yield losses due to adverse weather conditions over the past two years also played a major part in reducing output.</P>
      <P>Set-aside of land is a key element of CAP reform.  It is an obligatory requirement under the arable support system and applies in all member states without exception.  It is not open to me to waive this requirement.  However, I welcome the decision made by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers last week to reduce the set-aside requirement by 3 per cent &mdash; a proposal which received my full support.</P>
      <P>I am aware also of the potential threat to Irish cereal production posed by the eligible land requirement which restricts arable production to certain types of land.  It is my intention to seek the removal of the eligible land requirement in the context of individual base areas, as a matter of priority.</P>

I feel that this would be grossly unfair to farmers, whom, at the end of the day, we are depending on to protect those sites that are so important for nature conservation.</P>
    <P>In the case of all sites which were not formally surveyed, experienced ecologists reviewed the boundaries on the basis of a desk study.  Wildlife Rangers have since visited most of the sites and the sites will be visited by staff ecologists as soon as resources permit.  I should also point out that all of the sites being designated were originally selected by ecologists of the Wildlife Service or An Foras Forbartha.</P>

      <P>A sum of £500,000 is provided for in the acquisition budget for 1994 and a further £1.5 million is available from the EU.  The total expenditure will, however, depend on the site types purchased i.e. certain priority habitats are eligible for 75 per cent EC funding under LIFE and bird sites are eligible for 50 per cent co-funding. It is not the practice to give details of individual contracts.</P>
      <P>To date a total of £1,142,233 has been spent this year on the acquisition of land by the National Parks and Wildlife Service for conservation purposes. Included in this figure is a total of £475,000 &mdash; 41 per cent &mdash; which has been spent on land which will be in national parks.  Two-thirds of this was spent on acquisition of priority habitats. The rest is in a candidate special protection area for birds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to the pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of their career. This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people, including farmers, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are, of course covered for survivors' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension.  Such insurance can be combined with <Col N="1857" /> insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance less than ten years before pension age or who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard costings made in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, including farmers, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis. The cost to an individual contributor buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; puts forward, <i>inter alia,</i> a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions. The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present and I intend, in due course, to bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report.</P>

      <P>It is totally incorrect to imply that my Department did not reply to the query of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in November 1989 in relation to whether intervention stocks had been used to fulfil contract for the supply of beef to Iraq. I referred to this matter in detail in my address to the Dáil during the debate on the tribunal report on 3 September 1994.</P>
      <P>The request for such information was made orally to my Department in November 1989.  The response was not to refuse to provide the information but was rather to say that it would take a very substantial amount of time and resources to meet the request.  The reason for that response is that, while the information was available in my Department, it was not readily so.  Sales from intervention are not conditional upon the beef being dispatched to any particular destination, except in a minority of cases.  Moreover, there was no regulatory reason, EU or Departmental, for statistics on intervention sales to be categorised by reference to export destination.</P>
      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce did not follow up on my Department's response with a request to provide the information over time. My Department's initial assessment of the time it would take to provide the information was subsequently well borne out when some 40 additional temporary staff had to be employed over several months to meet a similar request from the Beef Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly a need for environmental impact assessments for forestry and other developments which are likely to have a <Col N="1867" /> significant effect on the environment by virtue of their nature, size or location. This has been recognised by the inclusion of forestry development over a certain size in the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1989.</P>
      <P>Given the rapid development of Ireland's forestry sector in the past few years it is appropriate that we now review the adequacy and effectiveness of controls in this area.  Accordingly, a review of controls relating to the scale of forestry development and the effectiveness of planning controls in this area was announced earlier this year by the then Minister of State for Forestry and Rural Development.  This review is being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment.  The current 200 hectares threshold for initial afforestation is one of the elements under examination as part of this review.</P>
      <P>Submissions were invited from a number of concerned organisations, including local authorities, farming and environmental organisations, and have indicated a range of views as to what adjustments if any should be made to the current regime.  These views are being taken into account in the review. Work in this area is now well advanced and I expect to receive a report and recommendations in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The general guidelines for the allocation of quota under this scheme include a provision which will restrict the loss of quota from more severely and less severely handicapped areas, areas which have been defined by reference to objective criteria.

      <P>As far as the application of Directive 92/102/EEC to sheep, goats and pigs is concerned it is envisaged that all suppliers may submit their identification systems for approval and, once approved, farmers will be free to choose from any supplier.</P>
      <P>In the case of cattle it is expected that a single supplier will be chosen by a tendering process and farmers will be required to purchase from that supplier for the duration of the contract.  This matter has received detailed consideration by my Department and consultation with the farming bodies has taken place.  It has been concluded that the selection of a single supplier offers the best prospect for a controllable, secure and standardised identification system. Confidence in the national bovine identification system is critical from the point of view of animal health controls and the administration of livestock premia payments.</P>
      <P>As regard employment the position is that under EU legislation all manufacturers throughout the EU are equally entitled to tender for public contracts and it is not possible to discriminate between tenderers on the basis of where the resultant employment will be created.</P>

      <P>The European Union's Thermonuclear Fusion Programme is part of the recently agreed Fourth Framework Programme 1994-1998 in the field of research, technological development and demonstration.  The fusion programme is aimed at the production of power using abundant and readily available fuels, yet at the same time minimising environmental pollution and thereby complying with the need for sustainable development.  The Programme is carried out by the European Commission in its own research facilities and through contracts with associated research laboratories.  All member states apart from Luxembourg, Greece and Ireland have at least one associated fusion laboratory.  On a wider front, <Col N="1875" /> Europe joins with the United States of America, the Russian Federation and Japan in the design of an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).</P>
      <P>At present, Ireland participates in a number of committees of member states overseeing the EU Fusion Programme and also through research contracts undertaken by Dublin City University and University College Cork.  In addition, a number of Irish personnel are employed directly by the Commission on work related to the Fusion Programme.  In all some 30 Irish scientists, engineers and administrators are involved.  In order to facilitate Ireland's ongoing involvement with the Programme, steps are being taken to set up an Irish fusion group which it is hoped will result in increased participation by Irish research institutions in the Fusion Programme.  While the Programme has a long time frame and high expenditure, which is funded through the Budget of the European Union, the potential of fusion as an acceptable alternative to fission in the generation of electricity needs to be fully explored in the light of the anticipated increase in energy demand and the Government's continued opposition to fission-powered electricity generation on grounds of public health and safety.</P>

The county council requested that the Department seek clarification from the consultants RPS Cairns.  Following contact with RPS Cairns, details of which I gave in my reply to Private Notice Questions on 26 October 1994, a senior official of my Department telephoned the Kilkenny County Council on 29 April to say that the consultants had indicated that the particular sentence was indeed open to misinterpretation and at variance with the body of the report and they wished to delete it.

In recent years health boards have employed many new staff, including nurses, home care attendants, paramedics and home helps to care for elderly people living at home.

      <P>Surveys of achievement in reading literacy have identified a number of important factors which contribute to the development of reading literacy skills.  When reading is valued and engaged in regularly in the home by parents, when parents read to children regularly and introduce them to books at an early stage, children usually <Col N="1887" /> become proficient readers.  Other factors which are important for juvenile literacy include regular attendance at school, the number of years spent in the education system and access to an effective programme of reading and writing instruction.</P>
      <P>The factors which contribute to adult literacy include a satisfactory level of literacy skills on leaving formal education, regular use of literacy skills throughout adult life and access to programmes which help to maintain and develop literacy skills.</P>
      <P>In recent years, I have significantly increased the number of remedial teachers at first and second level with a view to improving standards of literacy.</P>
      <P>Funding for the adult literacy and community education scheme has been substantially increased also in recent years.

Candidates who remain at school with a view to repeating the Leaving Certificate are charged higher fees, unless they are dependent on a medical card, because they have already benefited from the normal course of post-primary schooling and it is considered reasonable that those who wish to take an extra year should be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources. </P>
