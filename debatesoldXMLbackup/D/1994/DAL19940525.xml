    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, are an important initiative in the physical planning sphere.  They bring subordinate planning legislation up to date and establish new procedures of public notice and consultation for certain development by State and local authorities. In addition, they have the considerable advantage of drawing all relevant provisions together between two covers, thus making life a good deal easier for planning practitioners and the public alike.  The regulations are, by any measure, a positive and progressive step and are underpinned by the principle of ensuring that the planning process is as open, transparent and understandable as possible.  I am surprised and disappointed, therefore, that the response of Fine Gael has been to table a resolution seeking to overturn the regulations, which would nullify the many improvements they have introduced.  I do not believe that such a course of action can be justified by reference to the content of the regulations and I hope that <Col N="266" /> the statements will show that we are not witnessing an instance of opposition for the sake of opposition.</P>
      <P>It will help to put the regulations in context if I look briefly at their background and the reasons they were necessary. A lot of the administrative detail under which the planning system operates is spelt out in regulations made under the Planning Acts &mdash; it is there, for example, that one will find the requirements about what has to be included in a planning application, what notice has to be given of an application, most of the exemptions, the fees payable for planning applications, appeals and so on.  The basic regulations prior to the regulations we are addressing today dated from 1977, the last time there was a major overhaul of subordinate planning law.  However, the 1977 regulations had been amended on numerous occasions in the meantime and we had arrived at a situation in which no fewer than 19 separate sets of regulations were in force.  I do not need to emphasise how cumbersome and confusing this made matters, for people directly involved in the planning system and, more particularly, for members of the public.  I decided, therefore, that the time had come to clarify and rationalise the position, by replacing the 19 sets of regulations by comprehensive new regulations containing all relevant provisions. I came to the conclusion also that it would not be appropriate simply to draw the existing provisions together in a single document, because experience since 1977 had shown that there were quite a number of provisions requiring modification or improvement.  Accordingly, the 1994 regulations contain amendments considered necessary or desirable in light of experience, following consultation with planning authorities and other public bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking an overview of the regulations before moving on to address some of the new provisions, I would make the point that all parts, except Parts X and XIII, correspond, with modifications and adjustments, to provisions of the regulations that have been revoked.  Parts X and XIII, dealing respectively with <Col N="267" /> development by local authorities and Government Departments and the Office of Public Works, are new provisions which were signalled clearly when the necessary enabling powers were enacted last year in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, in the time available, to go through the regulations point by point and to detail all the changes made.  What I propose to do, therefore, is to highlight the more important alterations, concentrating in particular on new public notice arrangements for planning applications and appeals, changes in the categories of development exempted from planning permission requirements, alterations to the fees provisions and the new provisions concerning development by State and local authorities.  I am confident that this exposition of the changes will show clearly that they will operate to the benefit of the planning system.</P>
    <P>Looking first at the public notice requirements for planning applications, Deputies will be aware that, before the 1994 regulations, applicants generally had a choice between publishing notice of the application in a newspaper or erecting notice of the application on the site in question &mdash; the only case in which newspaper notice was obligatory was for applications involving an environmental impact statement.  There were complaints, however, that these arrangements did not ensure that people would learn of applications of interest or concern to them.  During the debate on this matter last year I gave a commitment to take account of the views expressed by members of the Progressive Democrats Party, Democratic Left and Fine Gael. I decided, therefore, that the existing provisions would have to be reinforced. I concluded, following careful consideration of various options, that applicants should be required both to publish newspaper notice and to erect a site notice.  In other words, the choice between the two forms of notice no longer exists and both are obligatory for any planning application received by a <Col N="268" /> planning authority on or after 16 May. These new requirements, coupled with the new requirements for weekly lists, go as far as possible in ensuring public awareness of development proposals, thereby seeing to it that interested persons and bodies can avail of the extensive opportunities for participation which our planning system gives them.</P>
    <P>There was already a requirement, under the 1977 planning regulations, for planning authorities to produce a weekly list of planning applications received. However, the 1994 regulations have extended the scope of this list and it must now give details also, among other things, of applications decided and cases in which the planning authority receives further information.  This considerably more informative list will be more widely available than hitherto; as well as being displayed in the planning authority's offices, it also has to be displayed in public libraries.  Moreover, copies will have to be made available to interested persons and bodies, free of charge or for a reasonable fee, as the planning authority decides.  It will also be open to a planning aurthority to display the list elsewhere, or to publish it, or make it available for publication, in a newspaper.</P>
    <P>The regulations also establish a new requirement for An Bord Pleanála to publish a weekly list of planning appeals received and decided.  Like the planning authority list of planning applications, the board's list will have to be available by the third working day following the week to which it relates.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also another change that has been made in the regulations in the interest of openness and transparency in relation to planning applications.  It will now be obligatory to make available for inspection, along with other relevant documents, any submissions or observations made to a planning authority in relation to a planning application.  There has been no legal obligation up to now to make these submissions or observations available and, in practice, only some planning authorities have done so.  I believe, however, that an applicant has a right to know of submissions <Col N="269" /> made about his development proposals.  The new provision will ensure that the applicant has access to them. This is another matter which was referred to in the debate last year to which I have responded.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any sustainable objections of principle can be raised to these new measures aimed at maximising public information.  I am satisfied, moreover, that they are practical and effective initiatives and I await with interest Deputy Barrett's rationale for tabling an annulling resolution, the effect of which would be to set these changes aside.</P>
    <P>The next area I propose to address is the changes made in relation to exempted development.  Exempted development is development which does not require planning permission and is specified in section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and in regulations made under that section.  The 1994 regulations update and modernise this area by terminating some of the exemptions which existed under the previous regulations, placing restrictions on other existing exemptions and establishing some new categories of exempted development.</P>
    <P>The existing exemption for the laying out and use of land as a golf course has been removed and any development of that nature commenced after 16 May will, therefore, need planning permission. This change has been made because the development of a golf course is significant in terms of the proper planning and development of the area concerned and should be subject to scrutiny by the planning process before it may proceed.  Similar considerations underlay the decision to terminate the exemption for the use of land as a burial ground.</P>
    <P>A number of the new restrictions on exemption will be important in conservation terms.  As matters stood before the 1994 regulations, the demolition of any building other than a habitable house or a listed building could be carried out without planning permission.  The exemption will not now apply, however, to a building which forms part of a terrace of buildings, or which abuts on another <Col N="270" /> building in separate ownership.  This will allow the development control process to evaluate the streetscape and other implications of demolition proposals affecting such buildings.  There is also a new restriction on placing advertisements on listed buildings.  Planning permission will have to be obtained for any advertisements, other than small &ldquo;brass plate&rdquo; type signs or &ldquo;For Sale-To Let&rdquo; notices on such buildings.  This will permit the planning process to adjudicate on the appropriateness of proposals to exhibit advertisements on buildings which development plans have identified as being important for architectural or historical reasons.</P>
    <P>Other new restrictions include an overall limit of 25 square metres on the area of garages, sheds and similar structures that can be erected without planning permission in the curtilage of a domestic dwelling.  This class of exemption was open-ended prior to the 1994 regulations and had on occasions given rise to problems because it was used to construct large and obstrusive structures.  I have also placed an overall height limit of 40 metres on navigational aids, and any structure higher than this will need planning permission.  This restriction was necessary because structures higher than 40 metres could have significant visual implications and should be subject to authorisation through the planning process.</P>
    <P>The new exemptions in the 1994 regulations include the use of a house to accommodate up to six persons with a mental or physical disability and up to two resident carers.  This provision was included because of a ruling by An Bord Pleanála, on foot of a reference under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, that use of a particular house for this purpose needed planning permission.  I considered, however, that this use of a house could not be regarded as significant in purely planning terms and should not require planning permission.  The new exemption will facilitate the policy of care in the community being pursued by health boards and other bodies and <Col N="271" /> groups who assist persons with a mental or physical disability.  Among the other new exemptions are minor works by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works, such as provision of temporary structures in connection with visits of foreign dignitaries, maintenance of inland waterways, erection of minor structures and provision of car parks in public parks, etc.</P>
    <P>I have acted also to clarify the position of television satellite dishes, which were not provided for in the regulations replaced by the 1994 regulations.  One satellite dish will be allowed on a house, but subject to a size limit and other restrictions aimed at minimising visual obtrusiveness.  This exemption will not apply in the case of listed buildings.</P>
    <P>A new provision which has attracted some comment is the exemption from planning permission requirements for use of up to four bedrooms in a house for bed and breakfast purposes.  I would like to explain the background to this and to allay some of the unfounded concerns that appear to have arisen.</P>
    <P>Before the 1994 regulations, the planning code contained no provision in relation to bed and breakfast accommodation.  In practice, many such establishments had operated for considerable periods of time without planning permission. Their planning status came to the fore last year when An Bord Pleanála decided, on foot of a reference made to it under section 5 of the 1963 Planning Act, that planning permission was required for the use of a particular house for bed and breakfast purposes.  While this decision strictly related only to a particular case, it created a degree of uncertainty as to the planning status of bed and breakfast accommodation generally. Against this background, it was decided to include a clarifying provision in the 1994 regulations, which were then in preparation.  The regulations provide that the use of up to four bedrooms in a house for overnight guest accommodation is to be exempted development for planning purposes and, accordingly, <Col N="272" /> will not be subject to planning permission requirements.  However, the exemption will not apply if the use for such purposes contravenes a condition attached to the planning permission for the house, or would be inconsistent with any use specified in the permission.</P>
    <P>This exemption was granted on the basis that bed and breakfast operations of such a small scale will not have significant effects in terms of the proper planning and development of the areas in which they are located, and will not result in a significant change in the <i>de facto</i> position which has obtained for many years.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this new exemption relates only to planning permission requirements &mdash; it does not affect in any way the application of other statutory requirements to bed and breakfast accommodation.  For example, the fire safety, ventilation and other relevant requirements of the building control code will continue to apply where there is a change of use of a house to use for bed and breakfast purposes, and the application of the fire safety requirements of the Fire Services Act, 1981 to premises providing sleeping accommodation will not be affected.  Also, the requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 to 1989, apply to any premises on which food for public consumption is prepared and bed and breakfast operations, irrespective of their planning status, will have to observe proper hygiene standards. Accordingly, it is simply incorrect to say that the new exemption means there are no controls and standards for bed and breakfast premises.</P>
    <P>To summarise in relation to exempted development, the changes made as regards exemption from planning permission requirements constitute a balanced and coherent package which will enhance the effectiveness of the development control system by focusing its attention on those forms of development which are most significant in land use terms.</P>
    <P>In the case of fees, new rates have been established for development, such as golf courses, which has been brought within the scope of planning permission requirements. <Col N="273" /> Existing fee rates have generally been retained, but a higher fee has been imposed on applications for permission to retain development.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions over the years that retention applications should be discouraged by applying higher fees to them.  I agree with this and believe that retention applications should really only arise where an applicant is seeking to renew a temporary permission, or where there has been an inadvertent departure from the terms of a condition of a permission. For this reason, the new regulations provide that any other retention application will be subject to one and a half times the standard fee and a higher overall maximum fee of £15,000.  This will apply, for example, where an application is made to retain development carried out without planning permission and should act as a disincentive to such applications. It is not, of course, the only disincentive to carrying out development without the proper permission &mdash; anybody who does so faces enforcement action and prosecution under the planning Acts &mdash; but it will serve to reinforce the existing deterrents.  The Opposition has advocated higher fees for retention applications on a number of occasions in this House and I find it strange that it now seems to have difficulty with this and many of the other progressive measures in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Another change made in the fees area is a new exemption from planning application fees for voluntary housing bodies approved under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992. Such bodies have an important role to play in the provision of social housing and I considered it inappropriate to require them to expend funds on application fees. While the change is important from the point of view of the bodies concerned, it will not have a significant impact on planning authorities' overall income from fees.</P>
    <P>One of the completely new parts in the 1994 regulations, Part X, relates to certain developments proposed to be carried out by or on behalf of local authorities. It establishes a procedure of <Col N="274" /> public notice and comment for such development which culminates in the preparation of a report on the development proposal for submission to the elected members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Development by a local authority in its own functional area is exempted development for planning purposes, on the grounds that it would not make sense to require an authority to apply to itself for planning permission.  Certain local authority development is nevertheless subject to public notice and comment through environmental impact assessment procedures. However, for most development proposals by local authorities, there are no formal procedures for public information and participation.  Part X of the 1994 regulations brings about a significant change in this position, by applying a new procedure of notice and participation to a wide range of development proposals.  The procedure will apply, for example, to construction of houses and other dwellings, certain road works, bridges and tunnels, waste water treatment works, water treatment works, swimming pools, burial grounds, landfill sites, fire stations and so on.</P>
    <P>A local authority will have to publish newspaper notice of proposals for development to which the Part X procedure applies and give details of the proposal to specified bodies.  Documents and plans describing the proposed development will be made available for public inspection and a period of at least a month will be allowed for the public and interested bodies to make submissions on the proposal.  When the period for making submissions is over, the officials of the local authority will prepare a report on the proposed development.  This report will include a summary of the points made in submissions, the local authority's response to the issues raised and an indication of whether it is proposed to proceed with the development, subject to variations or modifications or not to go ahead at all.  This report will then be submitted to the elected members of the local authority and it will be open to the members, if they consider it appropriate, to direct under section <Col N="275" /> 3 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 that the proposals are not to proceed.</P>
    <P>This new procedure reflects the commitment to openness and transparency that underlies many of the new provisions in the 1994 regulations and it will lead to significantly greater accountability in relation to local authority development. How, therefore, is it possible to respond to an initiative of this nature by seeking to overturn it?</P>
    <P>The other entirely new part in the regulations is Part XIII, which deals with certain development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works to whom I will refer from there on as State authorities.  Before addressing the specific provisions, I would like to remind Deputies of the position under planning law of development by these bodies.  Following the Supreme Court's ruling in the Mullaghmore and Luggala cases this time last year that development by State authorities needs planning permission. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993 regularised the position of development already carried out without planning permission by those bodies and established the framework for the future application of planning controls to their development proposals.  Following a transitional period which ends on 15 June, development by these bodies will need planning permission unless it is exempted development and is covered by regulations under section 2 (1) of the 1993 Planning Act or is the subject of a ministerial order under that section declaring that it is necessary because of an accident or an emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) of the 1993 Planning Act provides that the Minister for the Environment may, by regulations, provide that the Planning Acts will not apply to proposed development by a State authority if the development has to be authorised under another enactment or if, in the Minister's opinion, it is in connection with or for the purposes of public safety or order, the administration of justice or national security or defence.</P>
    <P>Part XIII of the regulations constitutes <Col N="276" /> the exercise of the powers under section 2 (1) of the 1993 Planning Act.  The only development left outside the scope of the Planning Acts on the basis that it has to be authorised under another statutory procedure is arterial drainage works by the Office of Public Works, which must be approved by the Minister for Finance in accordance with procedures in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The development excluded from the remit of the planning Acts on national security or related grounds includes courthouses, prisons, Army and Garda premises and installations, and office buildings used for the purposes of in connection with the business of the President of Ireland, Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann, certain Government Departments and the offices of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>It is evident that developments of the categories I have mentioned cannot be subjected to the planning system's requirements of public disclosure of detailed plans and particulars.  To take just two examples, I do not think that anybody would seriously suggest that detailed layout plans of a prison or an Army barracks can be put on public display. Nevertheless, I was determined that there would be as much public information about, and involvement with, the excluded development as security considerations allow.  Accordingly, I have provided in Part XIII that much of the excluded development will be subject to alternative requirements of public notice and involvement.</P>
    <P>These alternatives requirements will oblige a State authority proposing an excluded development to which they apply to give public notice of the proposal and to notify the planning authority in whose area the development would be located.  Outline plans and particulars of the proposed development will have to be made available for inspections and there will be a period of six weeks for making submissions.  The State authority concerned has an express legal duty to have regard to submissions received, and must give public notice of its decision on <Col N="277" /> whether it will proceed with the development.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the time of enactment of the 1993 Planning Act that it was my intention that development would be excluded from the scope of the planning Acts on security grounds only where this was unavoidable in the public interest. The limited range of development to which Part XIII applies shows clearly that I have operated within those parameters and we are moving towards a situation in which, as and from 15 June, most development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works will be subject to the planning Acts in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Parts X and XIII of the regulations, taken together, complete the process of movement towards greater openness in relation to public development started by the 1993 Planning Act and bring us into an era in which there will be greater entitlement to know about and be involved with development by local and State authorities.  Once again, I feel compelled to express my puzzlement as to why there is an apparent wish on the part of the main Opposition party to set aside progressive changes of this nature.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of openness and clarity in planning matters led also to a second initiative which I took in conjunction with the 1994 regulations.  This is a series of 11 public information leaflets dealing with various aspects of the planning system. They cover a wide range of issues such as how the planning system works, completing an application form, the avenues available for commenting on planning issues, the planning requirements when building or extending a house and sectoral matters such as the planning requirements for farmers and business people.  The series builds on the leaflet on the new planning appeals process which I published in 1992 following enactment of the 1992 Planning Act and which was instrumental in ensuring a smooth transition to the new arrangements.  There was a considerable demand for that leaflet and this brought home to me the need for clear and readily available information on the planning process and how <Col N="278" /> it operates.  In designing the new leaflets, the central objective has been to set out the provisions of the planning code in a concise manner which is readily accessible to all and free of legal jargon.  I have aimed for a series that is as comprehensive as possible and which answers the questions most often asked by members of the public.  The leaflets will promote a greater public awareness and understanding of the planning system, will explain the changes brought in by the 1994 regulations and should help to ensure that there is nothing mysterious or off-putting about the planning system for anybody.</P>
    <P>The leaflets have been made available to the public through planning authorities and there has been a considerable demand for them.  This is a clear demonstration of people's interest in and their desire to be informed about planning matters and underscores the importance of the many changes in the 1994 regulations which are aimed at public information and participation.</P>
    <P>The 1994 regulations are a considered and comprehensive response to the need to streamline and update secondary planning legislation.  They will facilitate the efficient and effective operation of the planning system, and will, in conjunction with the new leaflets, make it more comprehensible and less daunting for people generally.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work went into the preparation of these regulations, including a consultation process with local authorities and the wider public.  I am grateful to the planning section in my Department and my colleagues in this House for contributions which were of great assistance to me in determining the final layout of these regulations.  I look forward to the widest possible participation in and the opening up of the system to make it as transparent as possible so that everybody can be more confident about the way State and local authorities administer their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the questions posed by the Minister about why I had the cheek to table an annulling <Col N="279" /> motion on these regulations.  Let me tell the Minister, without apology, that this Government, with its 35-seat majority, attempted to ram these regulations through without consultation and without opportunity for debate.  We would not be having this debate if I had not tabled that motion.</P>
      <P>From time to time the Government forgets that we live in a democracy, that this Chamber was designed for debate, that legislation is supposed to pass through it and that every Member elected to this Assembly has a right to express a view on any aspect of Government policy.  That does not suit this Government, it believes that because it has a large majority it can ignore the rest of us and deal with the business as it sees fit.</P>
      <P>Early in the debate on the legislation I tabled a motion that all regulations made by the Minister on local government matters should be brought before this House and confirmed or annulled in accordance with its wishes.  That is cumbersome for any Government because it cannot then get away with anything and it is difficult to come here and explain why it is doing certain things.  It is interesting that the Minister said: &ldquo;It would not be possible, in the time available, to go through the regulations point by point and to detail all the changes made&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we not go through the regulations point by point and detail the changes?  Many people will be seriously affected by these regulations and the Minister is admitting that he does not have the time to go through them. The Government could have given two or three days to this debate if they wished because this is secondary legislation, 172 pages, changing all regulations under all the previous planning Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me quote the Minister whose memory seems to be failing him. <Col N="280" /> When the Minister published these regulations it was stated:</P>
      <P>Mr. Michael Smith TD, Minister for the Environment, today 19 April announced that he had made major new planning regulations entitled &ldquo;The Local Government and Planning and Development Regulations 1994&rdquo; to replace all existing regulations under the planning Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To replace but not change.  It does not change them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann should have the opportunity to debate major changes like these, some with which I agree.  However, the Minister decided, when dealing with the so-called reform of local government Bill, to vote down an amendment tabled by me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party proposing that regulations made by the Minister would be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation. The reason he voted it down was that it would be very inconvenient for him.  Lest the Minister be under any illusion about these regulations, I will cite various bodies who wrote to me about this matter.</P>
      <P>The Construction Industry Federation stated:</P>
      <P>In democracies there is often a delicate balance between participation and efficiency.  The 1963 legislation which introduced the Planning Acts was an attempt to meet this balance but with the exception of the Planning Appeals System introduced in 1992 most of the changes introduced since then have resulted in a more cumbersome and inefficient planning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the representative body of the construction industry, the CIF is very concerned that the Department of the Environment did not believe it was worth while to consult with it before introducing the changes in the regulations.  The Minister did not bother to consult with the <Col N="281" /> federation which, on a daily basis, deals with these major issues.</P>
    <P>I will also cite a letter received from a large hotel in Cork.  It states: &ldquo;As a Hotelier, and member of the Cork Chamber of Commerce and Cork Business Association, I am appalled at this anti-business decision, taken without consultation with the industry and in direct conflict with the decision to `licence all accommodation' in the Programme for a Partnership Government&rdquo;.  The letter goes on to state that the hotel pays £80,000 a year in rates.  In a letter to a local Deputy the hotel manager stated: &ldquo;As one of my local representatives, I urge you to take up these points with the Minister for the Environment, Minister for Tourism and Trade and the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment seems confused as to why Fine Gael had the cheek to table a motion on the planning regulations.  I have given a couple of examples of what the public thinks of the introduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy against the bed and breakfast provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak on that issue in a moment.  Throughout the Minister's speech he took a swipe at me and wondered why I had the audacity to table this motion.  He spent most of his time wondering what Deputy Barrett is about. Deputy Barrett represents the public and the Fine Gael Party represents the people outside who are being totally ignored by the Government.  If the only avenue open to me to have a debate on an important issue such as this is to table an annulling motion, I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having tabled the motion I asked for Government time to debate it, but the Government did not have the guts to allow it to be put before the House this morning.  It decided we would have statements and, if I want to move my motion, I should do so in Private Members' time. That is codology; the motion should have been taken in conjunction with this debate.  The Minister wonders why we have taken this step, but the reason is <Col N="282" /> quite simple.  It is the only avenue open to the Opposition to have a debate on 172 pages of new planning regulations introduced by the Minister, who attempted to push them through without any debate whatsoever.  The legislation states that within 21 sitting days the Opposition may table a motion to annul the regulations.  I do not wish to annul all the regulations, but this is the only avenue open to us and it is up to the Minister to decide whether he will change the position.  He had the opportunity in introducing the new regulations to bring legislation before the House where we would have teased out, section by section, the various changes proposed. The debate today simply allows us express a viewpoint.  It does not allow us to change the regulations.</P>
    <P>A number of people are seriously concerned about the regulations.  I wish to point out some of the main issues that should be mentioned, particularly as they relate to development plans.  The introduction of the new regulations provided an opportunity for the Government to make available to the public the development plans adopted by each local authority, but the Minister missed that opportunity.  I am not satisfied that the public is fully aware of the development plans and zonings on parcels of land or of major road proposals that may be in the pipeline, not necessarily national primary routes but secondary routes that affect the ordinary individual, the estate they live in and whether they should buy a house in a particular place.  This information should be regularly on display and available to the public.  Unless people pay a fee to the local planning office they do not know what the future proposals of a local authority may be,.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider introducing regulations to make it obligatory on each local authority to put development plans on public display in convenient places where the public can examine them.  The plans for each area should be on display in public buildings so that people will know what is proposed for their area.  That would cost nothing and it would be a simple way of passing on <Col N="283" /> information to the public who regularly complain that when they bought their house they were unaware that a road would be constructed or a development would take place in the area.  Perhaps one would say they should have checked further before buying the house, but the public by and large accept what they are told.  It should be possible for people to go to their local library or other public buildings in their area and see the development plan for that area.  It would involve no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the bed and breakfast issue.  Under the regulations, all homes may be converted for use as bed and breakfast accommodation, without any control system being put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary decision given the push that has been made for years to improve standards for visitors in a tourism dominated country. What regulations will be put in place to ensure proper fire, safety and hygiene standards?  The Minister said in his speech that we are only talking about planning permission.  Since I do not need planning permission, I can advertise my home as bed and breakfast accommodation, but what regulatory body will know that I am in the bed and breakfast business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy expect the tourists to find it if the local authority cannot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about control or public expenditure.  Is the Minister telling me there will be an army of inspectors touring the country looking for bed and breakfast signs and inspecting all those premises?  Will they put those people out of business?  Will they inquire whether planning permission has been sought and obtained previously?  Who will provide for all these new inspections? The reality is that they will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that in urban areas in particular these regulations <Col N="284" /> will cause untold problems.  In quiet residential areas there will be parking and traffic problems, with the added pressure on services which, in many cases, are already below acceptable standards. In housing estates in towns and cities people with four bedroom houses can set up a bed and breakfast business without planning permission.  They can advertise in the local papers and abroad which will attract visitors, many with cars, which will result in major traffic problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying that if I want to add a 23 metre extension to the back of my house, I must leave 25 square metres of open space.  Ordinary individuals, therefore, wishing to add on a small kitchenette and an additional bedroom to the back of their house will require planning permission unless they leave 25 square metres of public open space. Under those same regulations the Minister is saying that if one establishes a bed and breakfast business in the same estate, one does not require planning permission. That is not an improvement in the planning laws.  The Minister should outline clearly how he intends to ensure that the necessary standards in relation to fire, safety and hygiene will be put in place.  He has the responsibility to tell this House how these controls will be implemented.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, the outskirts of many towns have been changed by a proliferation of premises offering accommodation with associated advertising.  In addition, there are major implications for pollution controls on underground water supplies with the possibility of old septic tanks or cesspits not operating to current standards.  The Minister will now allow householders with septic tanks to establish bed and breakfast businesses without the necessay additional capacity which may cause pollution.</P>
    <P>Bed and breakfast accommodation is an essential part of our tourism industry but there is an obvious need for controls in relation to standards, traffic and parking problems, the protection of our underground water supplies and the prevention of pollution.  People who run <Col N="285" /> hotels and guesthouses pay heavy rates to local authorities.  I received a letter from the owners of a major hotel in Dublin who will pay £350,000 in rates this year to Dublin Corporation.  They are attempting to employ people, they are controlled by the need for standards in relation to fire, safety and hygiene and they will now have to compete with people who do not even need to apply for planning permission.  The Minister has not told us how these standards will be put in place, which is his responsibility. There is little point in him asking me for my opinion because he is charged with the responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of hotel, guesthouse and bed and breakfast accommodation but if Ireland is to develop as a major tourist attraction, and to provide high standards and encourage visitors to return we must have proper controls as well as adequate facilities.  There is little point in the Minister telling me that people can wander into unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation. Equally, I believe in the rights of the individual who bought a house in a quiet residential area only to find now that they cannot get in or out of it because of parking problems.  People's rights must be upheld in addition to improving bed and breakfast accommodation.  The Minister must find solutions to the problems he is now creating by this regulation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the exemption for the satellite dish, while I note that planning permission will not be required where the diameter of the dish does not exceed one metre, or where the dish is not placed in front of the wall of the house, on the front roof slope or higher than the highest part of the roof.  I understand that if conditions remain as they are it would mean that in certain cases it would be impossible to place a satellite dish in such an area.  For example, under these regulations a satellite dish cannot be erected on a terraced house facing south with a high pitch roof.  The same seems to apply to a house with a flat roof.  The Minister must clarify these points because some houses have flat roofs and some terraced houses face south.  The owners of such houses may wish to erect satellite dishes <Col N="286" /> and they want to know whether they need planning permission to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to extensions to the rear of houses.  The previous exemption, which allowed for an extension to the rear of a house provided it did not exceed 23 square metres and there was a height limit equal to the eaves or parapet of the dwelling house, was appropriate.  It did not cause any major problems and there was no demand for change in that regard. The Minister is now removing that exemption unless the person in question can satisfy the planning authority that 25 square metres of open space have been left at the rear of the house.  That is quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The 25 square metre provision is completely arbitrary and has no regard for the wishes of the owner of the house who may not want a large back garden who may want a small patio or who may simply find it impossible to provide 25 square metres of open space.  Many houses including terraced houses in towns and cities have small back gardens. There are also houses with no front gardens because of layout or design and it suits many people not to have a large back garden because they may not be in a position to care for it.  Why did the Minister introduce a requirement that one now must have 25 square metres of open space at the rear?  It simply does not make sense.  Why did the Minister choose a figure of 25 square metres?  The Minister must explain to us why this change is being made and why it will be necessary to send in these applications, with the appropriate fees, to a local authority to obtain planning permission for something that caused no problems in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the new provisions in relation to the notice of planning applications.  It is now proposed that a notice be placed on the site in addition to the usual newspaper notice.  The notices in the newspaper are very small and tucked away in a part of the newspaper which is not usually read.  If the newspaper is not read, the notice is, by definition, not public.  As is the case in Northern Ireland, a weekly list of planning <Col N="287" /> notices should be published by local authorities on a specified day in prominent newspapers in their areas so that the public are informed of each application lodged.  This would obviate the necessity for individuals to publish notices which may nor may not be seen by the public. The planning authority could charge a reasonable fee to the applicant for advertising the application.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has to leave the House.  Since he castigated me for having this debate it is rather unusual that he should walk out in the middle of my contribution.  So much for this debate.  It is insulting for a Minister to pose questions to me and ask why I had the cheek to put down such a motion and, before I have an opportunity to make my case, to walk out.  This is another example of the Government's arrogance.  The Chamber means nothing to it &mdash; it is an inconvenience and a hindrance.  The sooner it cops itself on the better for the democratic system.  The Minister should not ask any questions if he is not prepared to stay and listen to the answers.  Many people take the new regulations seriously.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if local authorities advertised a weekly list of notices on a specified day on a prominant page in a prominent newspaper.  They could charge an advertising fee to the applicant who would be free from the hassle of inserting notices in newspapers.</P>
    <P>The site notice proposal appears to be popular.  There is a lot to be said for it but before it is made mandatory in these regulations the Minister should explain how the system will operate.  Under the regulations it is obligatory for a site notice to be displayed for one month.  What happens if the notice is vandalised, damaged or deliberately removed?  How is the local authority to know if the notice is on display for a month?  Does the application fall because the applicant has not complied with the condition that the notice be on display for a month?  Will the Minister say who will carry out these inspections?  Are local authorities expected to examine each site and ensure <Col N="288" /> the notice is on display for a month?  If the notice is removed for a day or a week will that render the planning application invalid?  There will be many court cases concerning this issue.  It may not be popular to question these regulations but at the end of the day they must be capable of implementation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there is no provision in the regulations which would prevent An Bord Pleanála contravening a development plan.  It is an appeals board and should not have power to contravene the development plan of a local authority. Effectively it can rezone land without being answerable to anyone.  The requirement for An Bord Pleanála to display a weekly list at its office is a bit of a joke.  Their office is in the centre of Dublin.  Who will see the list?  It will be difficult enough if one lives in Dublin but if one lives outside it, one will never see the list.  Why not require An Bord Pleanála to advertise in the way I suggested for local authorities?  Will the Minister include the Irish Architect Society in the list of bodies to nominate candidates to the architectural and planning panel of An Bord Pleanála?</P>
    <P>As regards unauthorised development it is scandalous that people erect buildings and then apply for retention.  The only penalty imposed under the regulations is to charge one and a half times the normal fee.  That is a joke.  Anyone who erects a structure without planning permission should be made pay for the untold problems they cause others.  How many times have structures been knocked down?  The truth is they are not. People break the law and should have to pay a price for doing so.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have more time to debate the issue but it is typical of what is happening in this area.  We discussed a local government rerform Bill but we only had time to deal with half the section on Committee Stage.  We are discussing 172 pages of planning regulations and I am told my time is up.  The Minister of State fought long and hard when in Opposition for his voice to be heard.  I warn the Government that there are many people who are angry at the behaviour <Col N="289" /> of the Government and the way it treats the House.  They are angry at the appalling treatment of the Opposition and the fact that debates are carried on in back rooms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This debate gives me and others an opportunity to voice our concern but the regulations will not be changed.  It will cost the public £22 to purchase a copy of the regulations.  Who can afford that?  Who knows it is available?  It would have been convenient for the Government to slip these regulations through the back door without any debate but for the fact that this motion was tabled.

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Barrett's concerns about the toothless nature of the debate on these regulations which are of fundamental importance to our planning laws.  This raises questions about the need to set up a special committee of this House to consider secondary legislation.  I understand that previously such a committee was set up to consider the implementation of directives and the requirements on this State to implement them.  At present there is no adequate debate in this House on EU directives and their implications for jobs <Col N="290" /> and certain aspects of Government policy.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has some responsibility in this area but it has not debated any EU directives since the Government came into office.  These regulations will have a major impact on planning in cities and towns.  Yet we do not have an opportunity to debate them in any great detail.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to replace the 19 sets of regulations by comprehensive new regulations in one booklet. However, I found it very difficult to get a copy and asked the Government Chief Whip's office to send me one.  I was told by the Department of the Environment that I would have to buy a copy of the regulations in the Government Publications Sales Office.  This is the sort of ridiculous disrespect shown by the Government to the Opposition in regard to the procedures of this House.</P>
      <P>The world is divided into people who care about planning and think it is politically important and those who think it is a matter for the local authorities.  As a member of the planning committee of Dublin City Council I believe planning is very important.  For that reason I welcome the limited opportunity afforded to us to debate these regulations.  Residents associations, particularly in Dublin city and the greater Dublin area have taken it upon themselves to be constantly vigilant about the enforcement of planning regulations. As Deputy Barrett said, one can put in place hundreds of regulations and a seemingly cohesive set of laws on the built environment but it is only through the enforcement of those regulations and laws that any difference can be made. There is widespread concern that the regulations governing the built environment do not have teeth and that sufficient staff are not available at local authority level to investigate complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome some of the regulations, which are an improvement on previous regulations.  While I welcome the requirements in regard to the display of notices on sites, why will the sign have to be displayed for one month only and not two months as in the case of planning applications?  How will the requirements <Col N="291" /> in this area be policed?  If the one month requirement has been met before the inspector visits a site this may raise procedural problems as the planning application will still have to be processed.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations bed and breakfast establishments will not be required to seek planning permission.  This exemption may be too liberal as no account has been taken of the off street parking implications, particularly in built-up areas close to the city centre.  Many of the residents in residential streets in Rathmines and Ranelagh are constantly fighting to retain the residential status of these streets.  The liberal exemption of bed and breakfast establishments from the requirement to seek planning permission will impact adversely on these areas in terms of traffic.  While it will be profitable for people to open bed and breakfast establishments close to the city centre, there may be a proliferation of such establishments on many beautiful residential streets in the suburbs.  Further consideration needs to be given to this liberal exemption and its effects on the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the hygiene and fire and safety regulations, this exemption is much too loose from the point of view of planning and needs to be tightened.  It is a political sop to try to resolve a section 5 problem, as happened recently in Galway, by referring to the status of bed and breakfast establishments.  This exemption also has an implication for jobs in the hotel sector as bed and breakfast establishments are normally run by families.  There is a good aspect to this in that it enables women to earn money within their own homes.  However, all these matters have to be considered on the basis of proper planning and the impact on jobs in the hotel sector. Deputy Barrett referred to the concerns expressed by major hotels in Dublin about the increase in the number of bed and breakfast establishments in Dublin city which will impact badly on their business and their capacity to compete.  In many ways, it may be regarded as unfair competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> I wish to refer to the height restrictions on extensions to the rear of houses. Instead of fine tuning the requirements in this area the height restriction on eaves or parapets will give rise to the building of more flat roofs instead of extensions which fit in with the existing structure and are architecturally pleasing to the eye.  This restriction will not improve matters, and I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Barrett about the 25 square foot requirement which does not seem to have been fully thought through.</P>
    <P>Part II which deals with exempted developments in regard to advertising on commercial premises, the type of signs which can be erected on business premises and the quality and size of the signs has always been confusing from an operational point of view.  It would take a mathematician or a very patient person to work out the combination of signs which can be erected on commercial premises.  The proliferation of signs on buildings around Dublin is of major interest from a planning point of view. Dublin Corporation felt it was necessary to issue guidelines on shop front design so that there would be clarity of identification and simplicity of form which was aesthetically pleasing to the eye and would not interfere with streetscapes.</P>
    <P>This section remains difficult to read and comprehend.  It does not clarify guidelines on what is permitted or not.  It is not sufficient to restrict one, when selling a premises, to one sign &mdash; one cannot have Jones Lang Wootton, Sherry FitzGerald or a whole proliferation of auctioneers advertising one premises, which does have a deleterious impact on the streetscape.  The streetscape in Rathmines is destroyed by the proliferation of gaudy signs, some illuminated, some in Celtic letters, some others in horrible sixties aesthetic letters, the whole a total mess.  It has caused planners in Dublin major difficulty endeavouring to introduce some cohesion into the streetscape; &ldquo;streetscape literacy&rdquo; is the term they use throughout the city.  Many commercial enterprises do not have an <Col N="293" /> understanding of the importance of signage to the streetscape.  Apart from the brass plaque, all other signs should be regulated in some manner, principally by way of planning permission and, in precise detail, by way of licence.</P>
    <P>Such signs have been a major blight on rural landscapes.  There is no cohesion <i>vis-à-vis</i> their erection.  Individual commercial enterprises should be entitled to reasonable identification.  That test of reasonableness should be the task of the planning authority; it should not be done by means of these regulations.  Signage is too diverse and not properly planned or through out.</P>
    <P>In relation to exempted developments undertaken by State authorities, I note that these regulations exclude buildings such as courthouses, prisons, the Houses of the Oireachtas and so on.  I am concerned that these should be excluded from the strict planning process.  While there is an alternative planning arrangement, the bottom line is that the £10 million development in the grounds of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to be excluded from the planning process.  I do not believe that is justified on security grounds.  The alternative process mentions a requirement that there should be public notice and consultation.  If there is to be a development between Agriculture House and the back of the National Museum, fronting on Kildare Street, that will be a huge issue for the planning authority. It will be a major development in terms of changing the Kildare Street streetscape and will have an impact on this building, which I would regard as a national monument.</P>
    <P>We should not allow any slippage from or dilution of the planning process on nebulous security grounds.  The security argument does not wash in relation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There should be clear guidelines laid down and strict adherence to the development plan.  In the press release issued by the Minister it was stated that this lesser planning process should be sufficient to accommodate views that might be expressed by organisations such as An Taisce or Dublin Corporation. The decision whether to <Col N="294" /> proceed with the development and the finer detail of the facade fronting on Kildare Street should be pored over and subjected to the most rigorous planning scrutiny.  There is the proposal for another development which will have an impact on that side of Leinster House fronting Leinster Lawn.  The stonework and everything to do with that facade should be subject to the same rigorous planning scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that, on security grounds, courts and buildings related to them should be exempted from the strict planning process.  Many courthouses are absolutely beautiful buildings, in some cases the main building of heritage value and architectural beauty in a town.</P>
    <P>I do not trust the Office of Public Works always to get it right, although it has to be acknowledged they have undertaken and completed some excellent work in the development of Government projects.  The whole spirit of the Supreme Court decision in the case of the Mullaghmore interpretive centre was to the effect that State development should be subjected to the planning process.  In introducing this range of exemptions, we are undermining the spirit of that decision.  The Minister should reconsider that, particularly as it relates to the development plans for Leinster House.</P>
    <P>In relation to restrictions on exemptions in Article X, page 86 of the regulations, I note that listed buildings are not included in exempted development. This is good, although we must begin to examine closely what is and is not listed. The only way to deal with that is by way of comprehensive conservation legislation. Notwithstanding the fact that listed buildings are not included in exempted development, section 4 (1) (g) of the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act refers to any structure and allows for works on maintenance, improvement or other alteration.  Is this section not in conflict with the regulations? In other words, does the 1963 Act take precedence?  Is that to be regarded as the superior Act?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  For example, in a major Dublin Corporation <Col N="295" /> case, the courts held that aluminium windows did not constitute a bad maintenance conversion in relation to listed buildings.  The State actually encouraged people to instal aluminium windows in their houses, but they have had a devastating effect on many listed and other buildings in Dublin, particularly in residential areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should re-examine the problem of the shopfront.  The regulations are not sufficiently tight and do not give sufficient leadership on the matter of the proliferation of signs on shopfronts.  Anybody who travels through O'Connell Street will have observed that &mdash; on the recommendation of a specific task force established by Dublin Corporation &mdash; much of the awful signage has been eliminated, particularly on upper storeys of buildings in that street.  A lot of work remains to be done. The guidelines on shopfront design issued by Dublin Corporation amount to a recommendation which is not being enforced in any practical manner.</P>
    <P>While I welcome some of these regulations I would be concerned about the proliferation of bed and breakfasts.  I am glad to note that the list of notices has been clarified.  I know that members of Dublin Corporation receive lists of various planning applications weekly, whereas in England notification of planning applications is issued by the relevant local authority to occupants of buildings on that street.  It is not left to the vigilance of residents associations to contact their member of parliament or local councillor, drawing their attention to the fact that such and such a development is going on.  Whenever a planning authority is notified of a planning application all of the people living on the street who will be affected by the proposed development should be notified in writing by the relevant planning authority, which would be a channel imparting relevant information to the people who really care about it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty Deputy Barrett experienced in having these matters raised, his only procedural route being to table a motion to annul the regulations. <Col N="296" /> While some of us welcome some regulations and recommendations, merely to introduce a major set of regulations without any opportunity to debate them is no way to change the planning laws.  Perhaps some Dáil committee would be the more appropriate forum within which to examine and debate such secondary or subordinate legislation more fruitfully than in this toothless debate by way of statement.</P>

      <P>I dtús báire, tá an-áthas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt ar na rialacháin mar atá siad, ach, ag an am céanna, bhí sé deacair iad a fháil &mdash; £22 a bhí orthu, agus bhí éileamh orthu sa leabharlann.  Tá sé an-íorónch ar bhealach go bhfuilimid ag caint ar níos mó eolais a phoibliú agus caoi a thabhairt don phobal bheith páirteach ach ag an am céanna £22 an costas atá ar an méid sin amháin gan trácht ar an reachtaíocht eile a bhaineann le cúrsaí pleanála agus nach bhfuil cuid acu ar fáil sa leabharlann fiú do na Teachtaí féin.  Ar aon chuma, I appreciate Deputy Barrett had difficulty in putting down many of the amendments which I too would like to see.  There are many good parts in the regulations and I would not wish to see them nullified but some aspects should be clarified and applied in our respective constituencies.  If these regulations had been in force a number of headaches could have been avoided and the public spared the expense of challenging decisions.  It is high time many of those issues were addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect which has come to my attention and to that of the public is the impact which the regulations will have on the hotel and guesthouse industry.  Their letters did most to alert me as little had been expressed publicly on many of the other aspects.  The hotels federation does not begrudge anybody the opportunity of opening a B &amp; B but they are competing directly with people who are able to circumvent the expense of going through the planning process.  I can understand how they are affected.  I tabled a question on the subject and I look forward to dealing with the matter further.  The EU <Col N="297" /> regulations governing people who wish to make home-made jams, bread or yoghurt are strange.  I am aware of requirements to install stainless steel kitchens and other expensive items by people who would not be competing directly except perhaps with multinationals importing to Ireland. They are seeking to enhance our local economies by providing produce but they are penalised.  There is a need for a balanced approach.  Perhaps we should deregulate some of the severe restrictions on the small scale operator while bearing in mind the importance of the hotel industry.  I am anxious that that industry would not be jeopardised in any way.</P>
    <P>The impact of parking regulations has been referred to.  I expect that the parking regulations for a four bedroom B &amp; B would have a greater impact than that required for an ordinary domestic dwelling. These matters should be taken into account and that is why planning permission is sometimes required.</P>
    <P>I recognise there are many good aspects of the regulations.  For example, the erection of signs on the site as well as a notice in a newspaper is one of those commonsense suggestions that has been around for years.  I often wondered if there was a difficulty in implementing it but now I find there is not.  I thought there was an amazing labyrinth of technicalities that I did not see.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed that that regulation was not in force before now. I recall the Minister's predecessor, the former Deputy Flynn, promising it but, or course, he took the road of the wild geese.  The erection of signs is dealt with in some detail.  I know from my experience with planning applications in Dublin County Council that certain things happen and people are not held responsible because it is difficult to pin anybody down.  I refer, in particular, to signs being taken down, disappearing or obliterated. Has any procedure been put in place to deal with the problem when the public complain that there are no signs and <Col N="298" /> when the landowner claims there was a sign but that somebody took it?  Can that issue be dealt with in a way that avoids the necessity of a court appearance?  These loopholes are fertile ground for legal action which do nobody, apart from the legal profession, any good.  I would like to see that regulation spelled out.  How can we deal with difficulties concerning the disappearance of signs?  These signs should not apply to planning applications only.</P>
      <P>We have had the long painful experience of the rezoning controversy in County Dublin on which the Minister promised to take strong and courageous action.  The rezoning proposals should also be subjected to a similar notification. Frequently they are known only to the councillors and those interested in proposing the rezoning.  Few people can take the enormous amount of trouble and organisation to visit the county council offices or other places where plans are displayed to examine them.  It would be preferable to ensure that the signs are erected at the site.  In view of the amounts of money earned through speculation and land rezoning, it would not be too expensive to get some hardboard, nails and a few poles to erect a sign.  Perhaps the Minister will have a more direct input in regard to motorway reservations &ldquo;desire lines&rdquo;, as they are known, which go through undeveloped green field sites. These green field sites are attractive and are used for marketing purposes by various builders and developers who present the area as a tranquil, sylvan setting for houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are gullible enough to buy houses where plans are already in existence for motorways which will drastically alter their environment should be alerted by their legal advisers.  A number of people who have contacted me are wringing their hands but it is too late.  I refer particularly to people living in the vicinity of the Broadmeadow estuary in my constituency, near Swords.  This is a very important estuary in its own right.  A great deal of soul searching has to be done about alternatives to destroying it. People spent £70,000 to £80,000 on <Col N="299" /> houses in that area and, until it was brought to their attention at a public meeting, were oblivious of the fact that this large structure would form part of the M1 motorway.  We need to go further and ensure that local people are made aware of the plans of councils, other public bodies or the private sector.  As far as possible, diagrams should be included. Members are expected to be able to read and write given the volume of paperwork involved in their work but many people are illiterate and would be very embarrassed if they had to ask someone what is written on a sign.  We should issue guidelines and encourage the use of diagrams in presentations.</P>
    <P>Although I have an affection for the Irish language I would be the first to admit that it is used as a smokescreen to distract attention from details of a planning application in newspaper advertisements. They are meant to be obscure. This matter needs to be addressed through the use of diagrams on site, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>It is good that details of planning application will be available in libraries and contained in newspapers but this is being done already to a large extent.  I am trying to separate the existing regulations from the new ones&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I compliment my local authority, Fingal County Council, whose policy is to ensure that details of planning applications are available in libraries and published in the local newspaper. I take my hat off to it.  Perhaps I am speaking to the wrong person but there is great mileage to be made by local councillors in acquiring information from the council for residents associations. The local councillor who acts as a messenger and does nothing else is credited with pulling a stroke when such information is public knowledge.  The people directly affected should be notified and they should not have to depend on councillors to sift through the information to <Col N="300" /> see whom they should tell to gain political advantage.</P>

      <P>The regulations dealing with golf courses are long overdue.  As the Minister appreciates, a vast number of golf courses have been developed.  There are many in north County Dublin, many of which are doing well, but I am anxious not to reach saturation point when they may no longer be viable.</P>
      <P>A proposal to develop a golf course in Portmarnock is linked to the issue of funding the county council in the sense that it involves a land swop.  As the Minister is aware, An Bord Pleanála overturned the decision of the council to grant approval for this development as an environmental impact assesment had not been carried out.  Because of a lack of funds &mdash; the Minister may indicate the reasons for this &mdash; the council was encouraged initially to swop public land and in so doing the public lost the right of access at a number of points to the shoreline.  This matter is dealt with in the regulations.  Will the Minister take a close look at the arguments made by people in Portmarnock, in particular by the three women who went to the trouble of challenging a multinational giant as well as the council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations state that development to which Article 9 shall not be exempted development for the purposes of this Act if the carrying out of such development would consist of the fencing or enclosure of any land habitually open to or used by the public during the ten years proceding such fencing or enclosure for recreational purposes or as means of access to any seashore, mountain, lakeshore, river bank or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility.  This does not apply to Portmarnock only, it is happening throughout the country.  The Keep Ireland Open organisation is trying to <Col N="301" /> ensure that this does not become the trend.</P>
    <P>The land in Portmarnock has been open to the public for much longer than ten years.  The Jameson family lived in the area and were happy to allow the public to use it as open space.  However, a multinational, because of a legal loophole, decided that the public should not have a right of way.  I hope the Minister will protect this right.</P>
    <P>The regulations constitute fire brigade action; these three women have been pouring buckets of water on the fire to keep it under control.  An Bord Pleanála has decided that they have a case and the matter needs to be addressed.  I ask the Minister to ensure that we are not closing the stable door after the horse has bolted as there is a great deal at stake.</P>
    <P>Individuals have managed to delay desirable developments such as the linear parkway between Swords and Malahide and on to Portmarnock by insisting that the council should make provision for vehicular access.  I do not think that this matter is dealt with in the regulations.  I ask the Minister to carry out a case study into how one person can insist on the council making provision for vehicular access to a linear parkway which is not required or necessary when access may be gained from other directions.</P>
    <P>It is important in making regulations that we are not seen to be helping the speculators or the legal profession to profit in interpreting them.  We ought to make it a priority that decisions can be made without reference to the courts. Rights of access will continue to be an issue as pressure builds to close off public land.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in view of his comments regarding the banks which he made in Newbridge, County Kildare, on 12 May 1994, the steps, if any, he intends to take to convey these views directly to the banks; if he has received any response from the banks to the comments made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks, and the financial system generally, have a critical influence on economic and social development, to an extent that is not the case elsewhere, in the business sector of our economy.  This influence affects the funding of business development, especially of small and start-up firms, the position of mortgage holders and housing development, the property development area, a wide range of other personal borrowings and the return which those who hold their savings with financial institutions receive.  All the areas I mentioned have a major impact on growth and emplyment in the economy.</P>
      <P>I thought it correct then to highlight particular aspects of the banks' influence &mdash; dealing with business development, and small businesses and farmers in particular &mdash; in the speech on 12 May.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment followed up on the area of finance for indigenous industry and particularly for small and medium sized companies since then and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, as I said, there is a wider area of contact with the banking and financial sector that Government must pursue on a regular basis, so that we can be satisfied on both sides that the banking and financial sector are, in a partnership sense, making the most effective contribution to development and to employment, and that this is compatible with the business environment, including internationally, <Col N="303" /> in which the banks and financial sector find themselves.</P>
    <P>I am arranging that, with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, I will meet the chairmen and chief executives of the banks and the other major financial companies to exchange views at the wider level I outlined. I am having the responses made by the banks, collectively and individually, to the issues I raised in the speech of 12 May examined as part of the preparation for the first of the meetings.  I intend that such meetings will take place in future on a regular, say six monthly, basis.  Individual Ministers will, of course, pursue specific issues, such as small business development, in the normal way.</P>

Can I also take it he agrees that inordinate profits are being levied on the consumer which contributes to the very healthy profits of the banks at their expense?  If the Taoiseach believes that the consumer is being ripped off and small enterprise deprived of necessary capital, he should create genuine competition in the banking sector.  He does not believe a word of that.  It is a popular gimmick in the run-up to an election for the Taoiseach to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, I will try to accomodate Deputy Deasy.  An agreed spread, which is not statutory or mandatory, is recognised.  The spread ranges up to a certain level between the deposit rate and the lending rate.  I am seeking a response from the banking sector as to why there is need for such a wide spread between the 1979 figure of 2.75 per cent and today's figure of 10.75 per cent, an 8 per cent difference.  I appreciate there have been changes in banking instruments and lending instruments since that time, but bank charges have been introduced also.  The whole area needs to be considered in terms of what return is required.  An expanding economy, such as ours, needs the availability of capital at the best possible price.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in response to Deputy Deasy's question spoke of an agreed spread between the deposit rate and the lending rate.  I understood that was the matter about which the Taoiseach publicly complained.  If there is an agreed spread will he explain who are the parties to such an agreement, how long it is in place, what is new about it and what he did about it when he was Minister for Finance and had direct responsibility?  Why is he complaining publicly about it now when he has agreed or acquiesced to it during the years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not listening to my replies to earlier questions. Deputy O'Keeffe should know that the Central Bank approves bank charges and there is an agreed spread between them.  We need to consider the overall demands of the economy and if we are being properly served in terms of the availability of capital at the best possible price to people who wish to invest money in our economy any create jobs.  In the budget we provided a facility of up to £1 million at subsidised rates to help small businesses set up to meet the demand for their services.  Many changes are taking place in the banking sector.  Larger firms are bypassing banks and approaching different financial institutions such as life assurance companies and building societies. We want to talk to the banks to see how this economy can be best served, which at the end of the day is in the interests of the banks.  The more businesses that operate successfully the better <Col N="310" /> it is for the banking sector.  There is a vested interest on both sides in getting matters right.</P>

That is the actual statement.  Does he agree that he ought to confirm that the emergence of a third banking force within the State sector cannot now happen?  What is his response to the reply from the bankers who said that the Taoiseach's criticisms were &ldquo;simplistic&rdquo;?

      <P>I have received plenty of complaints from people trying to start up a business who say it is extremely difficult because of the treatment they get from banks.  I have also received complaints from customers whose lending rate has been changed from AAA to AA to A and who have had additional conditions imposed.  Those people disagree with the view held by their bank managers.  The fundamental problem with our banking sector is that our banks go over the top in terms of security instead of considering the project, the people backing it and its possible success. Look at the role the banks played in the development of the economies in Germany, Japan and elsewhere; they took part of the equity and drove the development. We here will have to return to that at some stage.  We cannot continue to hang everything on security.  What good is security if the business fails?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a matter for Greece, as the member state currently holding the Presidency of the European Union, to propose the subjects for discussion at the next European Council, which will be held in Corfu on 24-25 June.  While the Greek Presidency has not yet finalised its proposals in this regard, it has indicated that the main subject for discussion at Corfu will be follow-up to the European Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.  The Presidency has also referred to the need to designate a new President of the European Commission at the Corfu Summit. The Deputy may also wish to note that it is intended that the Treaty of Accession to the European Union by Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland will be signed at Corfu on 24 June, immediately before the commencement of the European Council.</P>

      <P>Ireland's main interest is in whether we can secure the Presidency of the European Commission, despite the worst efforts of the Government.

Does he accept that his response to me when I first raised this issue and put forward the name of Peter Sutherland was misleading?

As to the states mentioned in this House last week, I found no trace of any support on the part of the three states mentioned by Deputy McDowell's leader.

      <P>Like the Taoiseach, I did not raise this issue with Mr. Sutherland before mentioning it in the Dáil. Will the Taoiseach not accept that there is a possible historic opportunity for Ireland to secure the Presidency, that this office commands great power and prestige and would be of great moment if this country could secure it, that the only name mentioned as a possible candidate is that of Peter Sutherland and that even if we on the Opposition side try to secure support, <Col N="314" /> it is essential that the Government should at least put his name forward?  Let me make a fair offer to the Taoiseach.  If he is prepared to do his part, we on the Opposition side will certainly not be found wanting but will do our part.  If the Taoiseach's concern is for the present appointee in Brussels he can reappoint Commissioner Flynn to his position as Commissioner if Mr. Sutherland is not accepted for the Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn is doing an excellent job in his very important role in Europe and it is the intention of the Government to renominate him to his portfolio when the time comes.  If Deputy O'Keeffe and his party have so many authoritative sources of support for the candidate they speak about, I cannot find it anywhere, except I read it occasionally in a foreign newespaper.  However, when we check out the suggestions made in this House last week, we find there is no trace of any basis for such a claim.  Let us not cod ourselves into thinking that the Presidency is there for the taking.  No country has yet come forward in support of the candidate of whom the Deputy speaks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a compromise candidate not, by definition, somebody for whom nobody is rooting as their first choice?  Is it not very easy to make a split bid for the European Commission?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that Holland is putting forward its Prime Minister, Mr. Lubbers, for the Presidency but that Mr. Lubbers has no interest whatever in becoming an ordinary member of the Commission?  Could the same not apply here?  The Government can have all the faith it likes in Commissioner Flynn and still say that if, in the last analysis, there were a compromise available in the candidancy of Mr. Sutherland, Ireland's interests would be best served by supporting him for the purpose of the Presidency <Col N="315" /> only.  There would be no dishonour to Mr. Flynn in such a scenario.</P>

There is no sense in pretending that there is huge support for somebody when there is not.  There is support for Mr. Lubbers and for Mr. Duhaene from Belgium, and I presume the British are supporting their own candidate.

      <P>Tar éis an togra sin a fháil ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, iarradh orthu tuilleadh eolais a chur ar fáil faoi ghnéithe éagsúla, líon na bhfostaithe buana san áireamh.  Fuarthas cuid den eolas agus, ina dhiaidh sin, pléadh an togra le Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis.  Tá an tÚdarás ag déanamh staidéir faoi láthair ar phlean níos cuimsithí, a bheadh níos nasctha le riachtanais mhuintir an Daingin agus ina mbeadh an <Col N="317" /> togra a cuireadh ar aghaidh mar chéad chéim.</P>

      <P>Níl mé sásta in aon chor leis an fhreagra sin.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil an tÚdarás ag tabhairt a lán tacaíochta don scéim seo, agus tá tacaíocht agus airgead áitiúil ar fáil freisin. An raibh an Tánaiste riamh ag caint leis an Aire faoin scéim seo, agus cad a bhí le rá ag an Tánaiste, mar mheas na daoine sa Daingean gur thóg an Tánaiste an scéim seo as an Daingean go dtí Ciarraí thuaidh.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil seans ann an dara huair deireadh a chur leis na raflaí scannallacha seo nach bhfuil bunús ar bith leo.  Bhí mé ag labhairt ar raidió áitiúil i gCiarraí agus arís ar Raidió na Gaeltachta agus leis na hiriseoirí as na nuachtáin áitiúla agus rinne mé go ríshoiléir é nach ndearnadh aon argóint i gcoinne an togra seo, i dtaca leis an Tánaiste de, le mo Roinn.  Ní dhearnadh aon áitiú i bhfábhar ceann eile i ligean ar aghaidh agus constaic a chur i slí an chinn seo.</P>
      <P>Tabharfaidh mé míniú níos leithne, b'fhéidir, ná an ceann a thug mé don Teachta.  Luaigh mé, mar shampla, go bhfuil mé i bhfábhar togra níos cuimsithí. Is éard atá i gceist ná gur tháinig an togra faoi bhráid mo Roinne ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar shaincheist.  Cuireadh ceisteanna, mar shampla ar nós cá mhéad duine a bheadh fostaithe go buan; cén sórt todhchaí a bheadh ann dá mba rud é nach n-éireodh leis an bhfiontar seo, agus mar sin de.  Bhí mé ag cur béime ar fhostaíocht sa Daingean agus is é an bhrí atá le togra níos naschta ná go bhfuil muid chun cur leis an togra agus dúirt mé ag an am sin nach gcuirfí aon mhoill orthu siúd a bheadh ar lorg freagra uaimse.  Sin mar atá an scéal agus dúirt mé chomh maith go raibh mé sásta glacadh leis an togra mar chéad chéim de rud níos cuimsithí agus bheinn ag súil le go mbeadh an Teachta i bhfábhar níos mó fostaíochta a chruthú sa Daingean, maille le tuar buaine, rud a d'eascródh as an gcaiteachas atá i gceist.</P>

      <P>Níor thug an tAire freagra ar an cheist.  Níl sé fíor go bhfuil an tUdarás ag tabhairt lántacaíochta don scéim seo, le fada an lá.  An bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire gur thug tuarascáil McNulty le fios gur cheart ionad turasóoireachta bheith oiriúnach do gach sórt aimsire sa Daingean agus tá sé sin i gceist sa scéim seo, rud atá are eolas ag an Aire le cúpla mí anuas, agus ba cheart dó an ceadú a thabhairt don scéim seo anois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, sin é an fáth gur léigh mé tuarascáil McNulty.  Glacadh sa tuarascáil sin le go raibh gá le háis sa Daingean a bheadh in ann freastal ar riachtanais chuairteoirí, go háirithe nuair a bheadh an aimsir go dona, mar a bhíonn sé uaireanta, agus sin an fáth gur cheapamar go bhfáilteodh muintir an Daingin roimh an scéal a shoiléiriú, agus gníomhú, agus is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil muintir an Daingin sásta glacadh leis, ní amháin go mbeadh uisceadán ann ach go mbeadh áiseanna ann do chuairteoirí, mar shampla, b'fhéidir, an cheardlann atá ansin a aistriú go áit níos giorra don uisceadán.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil na focail &ldquo;níos leithne&rdquo; agus &ldquo;níos nasctha&rdquo; luaite.  Níl aon bhunús &mdash; agus dúirt mé seo cheana in agallaimh i gCiarraí &mdash; le moill cúpla mí bheith ann. Ar an gcéad dul síos níor tháinig faoi bhráid mo Roinne na ceisteanna a cuireadh ar na daoine a bhí ag cur an tionscnaimh seo ar aghaidh.  Agus caithfidh muid glacadh leis go bhfuil costas £1.4 mhilliún b'fhéidir, i gceist anseo, agus an chuid is mó de ag teacht ón Stát.  Is iad seo na ceisteanna: cé mhéad airgid atá á chur ar fáil ar bhonn áitiúil, cé mhéad fostaíochta buaine a bheidh ann, cé chomh slán agus atá sé maidir leis an todhchaí agus mar sin de.  Mar a dúirt mé tá roinnt den eolas faighte againn, ach níl mé ag cur moille ar an togra ag an bpointe seo.  Chomh maith leis sin, ionas nach gcuirfí moill air, bhuail mé le príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis agus tá seisean sásta an moladh níos leithne a thabhairt go dtí an tÚdarás agus tá mé ag feitheamh leis an fhreagra sin.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, na ráflaí nach bhfuil bunús leo, níl siad ag cabhrú le fostaíocht ná le muintir an Daingin.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 4, 11 agus 22 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Meabhraím do Teachtaí an freagra a thug mé ar Cheist Uimhir 39 ar 23 Feabhra 1944, atá ar fáil i gcolúin 505 agus 506 de Thuairisc Oifigiúil an lae sin.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt mé san fhreagra sin, chuir cruinniú den Chomhdháil Eadar-Rialtasach Angla-Éireannach ar 28 Eanáir 1944 comhthuairisc a chuir oifigigh Éireannacha agus Breataineacha le chéile maidir le leathnú a dhéanamh ar an bhfáil atá ar RTE i dTuaisceart Éireann rud a rachadh chun tairbhe do Theilifís na Gaeilge freisin &mdash; faoi mo bhráidse agus faoi bhráid an Rúnaí Stáit d'Oidhreacht Náisiúnta sa Bhreatain le breithniú, mar Airí a bhfuil freagracht fheidmhiúil orainn i ndáil le cúrsai chraolacháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag cruinniú eile den Chomhdháil Idir-Rialtasach ar 25 Márta, aontaíodh gur chóir go scrúdódh na saineolaithe Eireannacha agus Breataineacha mo phleanna chun Teilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil mar sheirbhís uile-Éireann agus go ndéanfaí tuilleadh oibre ar mholtaí chun <Col N="320" /> an fáil ar theilifís RTE i dTuaisceart Éireann a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúnamh a bheith ar fáil do Theilifís na Gaeilge ó Thuaisceart Éireann, tá súil agam go spreagfar craoltóirí agus léiritheoirí teilifíse ansin chun cláracha Gaeilge a sholáthar le craoladh ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Maidir le túsdáta craolta do Theilifís na Gaeilge, tá sé tugtha le fios do Teach agam i mo chuid feagraí roimhe seo go bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis an fhreagracht maidir le bunú na seirbhíse a leagan ar RTE.  Tá Údarás RTE tar éis Comhairle a cheapadh chun comhairle a chur air maidir le gnéithe éagsúla de bhunú agus de riaradh na seirbhíse.  Braithfidh an túsdáta craolta ar an dul chun cinn a dhéanfar le mion-conraí an togra.  Tuigfidh na Teachtaí gur saothar mór é tógáil an bhonneagair craolacháin do chainéal nua teilifíse.  Tá sé i gceist go mbeadh fáil ag tuairim nócha faoin gcéad den daonra ar an tseirbhís ó thús craolta an chainéil nua, rud a léireoidh ón tús an stádas náisiúnta atá le bheith aici.  Cé go raibh súil agam go mbeadh ar ár gcumas tús a chur leis na craolta i bhFómhar na bliana 1995, tuigim anois ó RTE go mbeadh sé níos réadúla a bheith ag súil gur go luath sa bhliain 1996 a tharlóidh sé.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá dhá cheist agam chun an Aire.  Is dócha go bhfuil a fhios aige go bhfuil a lán airgid á fháil ag teilifís theanga sa Bhreatain Bheag agus in Albain ó Rialtas na Breataine, agus i dTuaisceart na hÉireann tá tábhacht ag baint lenár dteanga féin i measc a lán daoine.  An aontaíonn na tAire liom go mba cheart go mbeadh Teilifís na Gaeilge ar fáil ansin agus b'fhéidir, os rud é go bhfuil Rialtas na Breataine ag cur airgid ar fáil ar son teilifís teanga in Albain agus sa Bhreatain Bheag, b'fhéidir go mbeadh airged le fáil freisin ar son Theilifís na Gaeilge ón Rialtas.  Ceist eile, an aontaíonn an tAire liom gur cheart go mbeadh díospóireacht oscailte ann faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Tá a lán tuarascálacha ag an Aire, ach níl siad ag éinne eile, faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge, go mórmhór maidir le hairgeadú Theilifís na Gaeilge, agus b'fhéidir go bhfoilseodh sé na tuarascálacha <Col N="321" /> sin ar mhaithe le heolas a thabhairt don phoblal, agus ansin bheadh díospóireacht oscailt againn go léir faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Ba cheart go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeilge ann ach ba cheart go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin ann chun gach rud dá mbaineann leis a phlé.</P>

      <P>Tá de bhuntáiste agam féin go bhfuil m'aigne déanta suas agam faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge, ach, ar ndóigh, tá de mhíbhuntáiste ag páirtí an Teachta nach bhfuil a n-aigne déanta suas acu faoi cad a cheapann siad de Theilifís na Gaeilge agus bheadh an pobal anbhuíoch díobh dá léireodh siad cá seasann siad.  Maidir leis na cainteanna a bhí ar siúl idir mé féin agus Peter Brooke, go neamhfhoirmiúil, agus na cainteanna uile a luaigh mé sa fhreagra, dúirt mé go bhfuil nithe éagsúla ann a mbainfeadh muintir an oileán seo ar fad tairbhe as dá bhfeabhasófaí na coinníollacha teicniúla maidir le glacadh RTE i dTuaisceart Éireann, agus chabhródh sé sin go mór le Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Na hullmhúcháin atá déanta is é an bhunaidhm ná go mbeadh glacadh ann ar fud an oileáin uile.  Maidir leis an dara rud a luaigh an Teachta &mdash; agus glacaim leis go bhfuil sé féin i bhfábhar an tseirbhís is fearr a chur ar fáil &mdash; is ceist é do Rialtas na Breataine an chaoi ina gcaitheann siad an t-airgead a chuireann siad ar fáil.  Ach caithfimid tosú leis na nithe is bunúsaí ó thaobh transmission de.  Ina dhiaidh sin níl sé ag fanacht mar tá cainteanna ar siúl go neamh-fhoirmiúil faoi conas is féidir linn cabhrú len a chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na tuarascálacha éagsúla, nuair a thosaigh mé ag obair ar Theilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil bhunaigh mé dhá choiste &mdash; coiste bunaithe agus coiste teicniúil.  Tá mé sásta na tuairiscálacha sin a fhoilsiú ach tuigfidh an Teachta, mar shampla i gcás an choiste teicniúil, gur chuir cuid de na daoine a chuir eolas ar fáil &mdash; eolas tábhachtach agus riachtanach &mdash; gur chuir siad an t-eolas sin ar fáil ar an gcoinníoll go raibh siad ag cabhrú le coiste nach mbeadh ag foilsiú ar fhonn an-leathan.  Caithfidh mé na coinníollacha sin a chomhlíonadh agus ag an am céanna freastal ar an iarracht réasúnta <Col N="322" /> atá ann an méid is mó eolais agus is féidir a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá sin ar intinn agam an méid eolais agus is cuí a chur ar fáil.  Tá mé lán sásta go bhfuilimid ag dul ar aghaidh go maith. Táimid ag comhlíonadh an sprioc dáta ó thaobh cúrsaí teicniúla de.  Tá a lán dul chun cinn déanta againn.  Tá an chomhairle bunaithe.  Tá na postanna foilsithe sna páipéirí nuachta.  Beidh na ceapacháin ag tarlú taobh istigh d'achar an-ghearr agus tá siad ag dul ar aghaidh.  Chomh maith leis sin is í an aidhm atá againn go mbeadh an tseirbhís ar fáil do 90 faoin gcéad den phobal on gcéad lá agus go mbeadh sé ar ard-chaighdéan.  Tá an t-ullmhuchán ó thaobh cúrsaí traenála ag dul ar aghaidh go maith freisin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 4 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, it is the function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission <Col N="323" /> to arrange for the provision of, <i>inter alia</i>, sound broadcasting services additional to any broadcasting services provided by Radio Telefís Éireann.  It is, therefore, a function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to arrange for the provision of community broadcasting services and it has already taken some steps in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on the whole structure of broadcasting, which I hope to publish shortly, will facilitate wide discussion on the needs of broadcasting, including the needs of community broadcasting, which I see as having a crucial role in the future.  If there are inadequacies in the current legislation, and I refer particularly to the 1988 Act, with regard to community broadcasting, these can be addressed in the context of the Green Paper, and the legislative response to the discussion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that local community broadcasting has been the great success story of the last decade?  There is enormous scope, however, for further growth and development in that sector.  To enable that growth to proceed apace, will the Minister consider strengthening the representation of local community radio on the Independent Radio and Television Commission in advance of the Green Paper or setting up a separate broadcasting authority for local and community radio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unhappy at the treatment that community radio, both as a concept and a reality, received under the life of the previous Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I have said that quite openly.  I recently appointed a chairman and members to the Independent Radio and Television Commission who have been approaching their task in a whole range of areas with great vigour and enthusiasm.  As the Deputy is aware, they have advertised for applications to determine the demand for community broadcasting.  In Dublin there are two licensed radio stations, <Col N="324" /> Anna Livia and Radio na Life.  There is a clear need in that area.</P>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's supplementary question directly, when one is composing the Independent Radio and Television Commission membership, and if one has regard for the spirit of the Act, one does not represent constituencies of interest.  The members must transcend any particular interest and address the general needs of broadcasting in the legislation.  The whole question of a separate Authority for community and local broadcasting must be debated and referred to in the discussions on the Green Paper as to what the appropriate structures are for, say, community, local and commercial radio. There is a difference between them and it is more than a nuance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tógfaidh mé ceist síniú na Cairte ar an gcéad dul síos.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a thug mé freagra ar cheisteanna den tsórt seo ón am a ceapadh mé mar Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta go ndúirt mé go raibh sé deacair ar bhealach mar tá stádas ag an nGaeilge i mBunreacht na hÉireann.  Is í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga.  Sa chaoi inar leagadh amach téarmaí na Cairte déanann siad tagairt do theangacha mionlaigh agus do theangacha réigiúnda.</P>
      <P>Bhí deacrachtaí eile ann.  Ach bhí mé ag teacht go dtí an tuairim le déanaí go mb'fhéidir go mba cheart dúinn an Chairt a shíniú.  Ach tháinig athruithe éagsúla ar choinníollacha, ach go háirithe mar shampla, beimid ag déanamh athbhreithnithe ar stádas na teanga go ginearálta i 1996.  So caithfimid a bheith cúramach nach bhfuilimid ag déanamh dochair do aon ardú i gcéim na Gaeilge i 1996 tríd an Chairt a shíniú ag an am seo.  Sin an rud a bhí i gceist agam sa bhfeagra a thug mé.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Glacaim leis an méid atá á rá ag an Aire ó thaobh 1996, ach nach bhfuil sé fíor freisin go mbeidh tíortha nua ag teacht isteach san Aontas agus a dteangacha féin acu?  Má táimid ag fanacht go dtí go mbeidh siadsan istigh nach mbeidh sé níos deacra fós stádas a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge, mar beidh níos mó teangacha ann ná mar atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nach bhfuil sé fíor nach bhfuil aon chostas ag baint leis an síniú seachas an dúch sa pheann i ndáiríre agus go léireoidh <Col N="327" /> sé stádas atá saor in aisce, cuir i gcás, seachas an stádas a bheidh ag teacht ó Theilifís na Gaeilge atá costasach go leor.  Ba cheart dúinn, b'fhéidir, an stádas nach bhfuil costasach a ghlacadh chomh maith.</P>

      <P>Níor thuig an Teachta an rud a bhí i gceist agam.  Tá sé i bhfad níos éasca dó tuairim an-shimplí a bheith aige ó thaobh na Cairte mar a bhí sé. Baineann an chairt le teangacha mionlaigh agus réigiúnda.  Níl an Ghaeilge mar theanga mionlaigh agus reigiúnda sa tír seo go hoifigiúil.  So an mbeadh an Teachta sásta scaoileadh leis an stádas a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge sa Bhunreacht? Cheap mise go raibh sé tábhachtach go mb'fhiú aird a thabhairt ar an deacracht sin.  Tuigim gur féidir linn dul ar aghaidh agus ní mise a bhí ag obair arna coinníollacha nuair a tháinig Éire isteach sa Chomhphobal Eorpach i 1973. B'fhéidir gur cailleadh seans ag an am sin.  Is cuma faoi sin, ach an chaoi ina raibh an cás nuair a thosaigh mé, mar aduirt mé, rinne mé scrúdú ar an gceist agus bhí mé ag ceapadh gurbh fhéidir an Chairt a shíniú agus glacadh leis na haltanna éagsúla agus mar sin de.  Bhí an obair sin déanta agam agus bhí mé sásta, b'fhéidir, bealach a chur ar aghaidh chun an Chairt a shíniú.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na tíortha eile a bheidh ag teacht isteach &mdash; agus beidh siad ag teacht isteach faoi Uachtarántacht na Gréige &mdash; cuirfidh mé mo thuairimí ar aghaidh agus caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir mo chomhleacaí sa Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha, an Tánaiste Dick Spring, mo tuairimí ar aghaidh.  Táimid i bhfábhar &mdash; agus níl aon deacracht faoi seo &mdash; aon rud is féidir linn a dhéanamh chun stádas na Gaeilge a ardú.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil oifigigh mo Roinne agus oifigigh na Roinne Gnóthaí Eachtracha faoi láthair i gcainteanna ag ullmhú an cháis is fearr do chúis na Gaeilge.  Ceapaimid féin go mb'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh sé pé ar bith i 1996.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ag rá go gcaithfidh mé an comhthéacs ar fad a chur san áireamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé féin i bhfábhar an usáid is mó a <Col N="328" /> bheith ag an Ghaeilge ann.  Ach chun an fhírinne a rá cuirim an cheist orm i gcónaí cá raibh &mdash; agus nílim ag caint faoin Teachta &mdash; daoine áirithe i 1973 nuair a bhí an cás i bhfad níos éasca?</P>

      <P>Ní cuimhin liom 1973 go ró-mhaith, caithfidh mé a admháil.  Ach faoi láthair is cinnte go bhfuil scéal na Gaeilge níos deacra fiú ná mar a bhí sí an uair sin leis an gcomórtas atá ar fud na hEorpa idir teangacha.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach nuair atá an tAire ag caint faoi a bheith cúramach i leith an chéad seans eile agus gan aon seansanna a loit.  An féidir leis a bheith cúramach freisin go bhfuil sé ag glacadh an seans atá ann chomh maith agus is féidir faoi láthair? Ní ceart a bheith buartha faoin teideal agus rudaí réigiúnda agus mar sin de. Tuigim an cás atá á chur aige.  Ach ar fud na hEorpa is réigiún muid ar aon chuma, agus in cúpla réigiún muid i ndáiríre ón dtaobh eacnamaíochta de.  Ní bhéinn róbuartha faoin teideal ar an mbonn sin. Ach tá sé tábhachtach seasamh a ghlacadh <Col N="329" />&mdash; go bhfuilimid ag dul i dtreo stádais oifigiúil agus gur féidir linn an Chairt a shíniú gan dochar a dhéanamh agus an coinníoll sin a chur isteach ann, b'fhéidir. Ach ní cóir dúinn a bheith in ár suí ar an gclaí agus ag fanacht le lá na cinniúna nach dtiocfaidh faraor má tá sé cosúil le Sellafield nó ceist ar bith eile dá leithéid.</P>

Tá súil agam agus muid ag déanamh sin &mdash; agus rinne mé tagairt do 1973 &mdash; go mbeadh cabhair agam féin mar Aire na Gaeltachta ag ullmhú moltaí agus ag dul i gcomhchainteanna le mo chomhleacaí sa Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha; agus nach millfidh ráflaí gan bunús an cás a bheidh mé ag ullmhú.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl mé sásta go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire cad atá sa Chairt.  Article 3 refers to the &ldquo;approval of each regional or minority language or official language which is less widely used&rdquo;.  This is not about classifying Irish as a regional or minority language; under Article 8 of the Constitution Irish is an official language of this country.  This is why Question No. 10 refers to an official languages Act. If we were to sign the Charter would it not be necessary to underpin it with legislative provision which would give equal recognition in law to Irish and English? It is not correct to say that signing the Charter would in some way take from the Irish language.  There is provision in the Charter for a regional or minority language or official language which is less widely used.  I understand that when he was in Brittany in 1991 the Minister indicated his support for the Charter and that previous Governments supported signing it.  Has that policy been changed?</P>

      <P>The policy has not been changed.  The document from which the Deputy quoted refers to an official language in a European Union context. I can give Deputies information if they wish.  I have already told the Deputy in Irish that if no opportunity of significantly improving the status of Irish in the Union existed between now and 1996 I would sign the Charter.  I have made the reasonable request that the issue of signing the Charter now be considered in the context of the greater gain which can be made from the language which may include signing the Charter, putting forward other proposals for the advancement of the language and making the necessary arrangements.  That is the present position.</P>

      <P>Information for which my Department is responsible relates only to objects of archaeological importance. Since 1985, 303 licences have been issued in respect of the export of such material.  In all instances the licences were for the temporary export only of the items and were for reasons such as radio carbon dating, conservation, geological identification or exhibition purposes. Archaeological objects are priceless in terms of our national heritage and it is, therefore, impossible to put a monetary value on them.</P>

      <P>During the 1980s my colleague, Deputy Nealon, the first Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, established the Hamilton Commission to investigate this matter and I understand that it made a number of recommendations. Does the Minister intend to implement any of those recommendations, one of which related to the <Col N="331" /> imposition of severe restrictions on the export of such material?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that many of those recommendations have been accommodated in the national monuments legislation.  Lest we forget, the first Minister for Culture was Count Plunkett &mdash; Deputy Nealon, my colleague the Minister of State and I came later.  I am happy that we are addressing this issue and if further revisions are necessary I will carry them out.</P>
      <P>On the question of putting a value on such material, it is only when an article has been removed from the heritage area and placed on the market that it assumes a monetary value.  These are priceless aspects of our heritage and I will do everything possible to protect them &mdash; this will be done in the legislation &mdash; in the name of all the people.  The very important right established in the national monuments legislation is based on the sovereignty of the people and their entitlement to their heritage from the moment they declared themselves independent.</P>

To my knowledge these licences were issued <Col N="332" /> for specific purposes and related mostly to dating and conservation.

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 12, 16 agus 18 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos is mian liom a rá go mbímse ag brath ar Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; an comhlacht Stáit reachtúil atá bunaithe chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn &mdash; chun tograí a aimsiú le lonnú sna limistéir Ghaeltachta.  Baineann deacrachtaí ar leith le tionscail a bhunú ar oileáin Ghaeltachta amach ón gcósta.  D'ainneoin sin leanfaidh an tÚdarás lena gcuid iarrachtaí d'fhonn tionscail fhiúntacha a aimsiú a chuirfidh fostaíocht bhreise ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán Gaeltachta ar a n-áirítear na hoileáin is ábhar do na ceisteanna.  I dtaca leis sin de ní miste a rá go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ag an Údarás maidir le deiseanna fostaíochta a chur ar fáil ar oileáin Ghaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le Inis Oírr tuigim ón Údarás gur tháinig méadú san fhostaíocht lánaimseartha i dtionscnaimh faoina scáth ar an oileán i 1993, i.e., ó cuig dhuine go <Col N="333" /> dtí 11 dhuine.  Chomh maith leis sin bhí 34 dhuine ag obair i dtionscnaimh ar bhonn páirtaimseartha/séasúrach ag deireadh 1993 i gcomparáid le 23 dhuine ag deireadh na bliana roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>I gcás Inis Meáin is amhlaidh go raibh laghdú beag i 1993 ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha agus go páirtaimseartha/séasúrach i ngnóanna a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás, i.e., ó 26 go dtí 24 dhuine agus ó 28 go dtí 25 dhuine faoi seach.  Tá an tÚdarás dóchasach, áfach, go méadóidh na figiúirí sin arís roimh dheireadh na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Níl aon togra suntasach á phlé ag an Údarás don dá oileán sin i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>I dtaca le Gaeltacht na Mí tuigim ón Údarás go raibh méadú ó 117 dhuine go dtí 120 dhuine san fhostaíocht lánaimseartha sa chontae i 1993 agus ó 11 dhuine go dtí 84 dhuine i gcás na fostaíochta páirtaimseartha/séasúrach.  Tá dhá thogra á bplé ag an Údarás i láthair na huaire don Ghaeltacht sin ina bhfuil fostaíocht shuntasach bhreise i gceist ach tá sé ró-luath go fóill a rá cén toradh a bheidh ar na comhráite sin.</P>

Ach an nglacfadh an tAire leis nach fiú biorán é an méadú sin nuair a chuirtear san áireamh a bhfuil ag tárlú ar na hoileáin go léir, siad sin dífhostaíocht agus imirce.  Tá baol ann anois nach mbeidh duine óg ar bith fágtha ar cheachtar den dá oileáin seo i gceann deich mbliana nó mar sin muna ndéantar beart níos treise chun fostaíocht a chothú ar an dá oileán.  An bhféadfadh an tAire a rá liom an bhfuil aon bheart nó fheachtas speisialta idir láimhe i mbliana d'fhonn breis fostaíochta a chun ar aghaidh ar an dá oileán sin?</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Aontaimíd go léir nach bhfuil go leor poist á gcruthú sa tír iomlán agus go háirithe ar na hoileáin.  Mar a dúirt mé i mo fhreagra, tá sé fíor-dheacair poist a chruthú in áiteanna iargúlta agus ar na <Col N="334" /> hoileáin.  Mar sin, caithfimid na jabanna atá ann cheana féin a chaomhnú agus poist bhreise a chruthú.  Chun é sin a dhéanamh caithfimid díriú ar achmhainní nádúrtha na réigiúin sin.  Níl ceist an bith go mbeidh an Rialtas seo ag déanamh reamairt ar na hoileáin.  I dtaca leis na hoileáin a luadh, chuireamar na milliúin punt ar fáil chun forbairt a dhéanamh ar na céanna agus tá sé sin ag cuidiú le muintir na háite i láthair na huaire.  Tá baint indíreach ag na comharchumainn ansin leis an bhforbairt seo.  Le cúpla lá anuas thug an tAire cead £100,000 breise a chaitheamh ar an fhorbairt sin in Inis Oírr.  Cén fáth go mbeadh rialtas ar bith ag caítheamh na milliúin punt ar na hoileáin muna raibh siad dáiríre faoi thodhchaí pobal na n-oileán sin.  Beidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag déanamh a ndícheall chun poist bhreise a chruthú ansin ionas go mbeidh jabanna ar fáil ag aos óg na tíre seo agus ag aos óg na n-oileán.</P>
      <P>Tá mé dóchasach faoin cheist seo agus ar ndóigh tá na milliúin punt ag teacht anois ón gComhphobal.  Chomh maith leis sin tá ocht milliún punt ann chun céanna a fhorbairt sna Gaeltachtaí agus ar na hoileáin agus is comhartha é sin ar dháiríreacht an Rialtais seo fá dtaobh an Ghaeltacht agus fá dtaobh na n-oileán.</P>

An measann an tAire go bhféadfaí níos mó dul chun cinn a dhéanamh chun poist bhreise a sholáthar i dtionscal na héisc nó i dtionscal na turasóireachta. An raibh an tAire ag caint le Bord Fáilte nó le Aire na Mara le déanaí féachaint an bhféadfadh sé aon fheachtas níos treise a chur i bhfeidhm chun poist bhreise a sholáthar san dá sector sin?</P>

Bhí ráflaí ag dul thart ag rá go ndúnfaí na céanna sin taobh istigh d'achar gearr.  Na daoine a bhí ag cun na ráflaí sin thart, ní dóigh liom gur cairde iad le muintir na Gaeltachta, le <Col N="335" /> pobal na Gaeilge nó le muintir Iris Oírr agus Inis Meáin.</P>

      <P>Ag féachaint don dochar a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ann don tionscal turasóireachta ar Inis Oírr mar gheall ar na hoibreacha mara a bheith ar siúl, thug mé cead do Roinn na Mara le déanaí chun fad breise 10.25 méadar a chur leis an bpiara atá ann cheana féin, ar chostas measta £100,000. Ciallaíonn sé seo go mbeidh báid farantóireachta bheaga in ann teacht i dtír fad is a bheidh na móroibreacha ar siúl.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the break I was speaking about the change in regulations that put the onus on those proposing golf courses to apply for planning permission.  That regulation is welcome and long overdue. Burial grounds, also covered in the regulations, seriously impact on the local <Col N="377" /> environment.  I am aware of two areas where, because of the unsuitable ground chosen, the remains surfaced in another person's property.  When it comes to applying for planning permission I hope that lesson will have been learned.  Also, ground water pollution has been caused due to burial grounds being inappropriately located.  It is very distressing for all concerned when such problems arise.  We are beginning to realise that even through certain things are underground it does not mean they are no longer significant.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in detail to the retention of planning permission which has almost become standard practice.  In this regard buildings are erected and developments carried out without any concern or urgency and an application made for retention.  The local authority is then faced with a decision to either cause enormous disruption and be accused of putting people out of work if they refuse permission or, alternatively, to bite the bullet and grant permission.  I hope this practice is on the way out.  Unfortunately I have had experience of this attitude on a number of occasions.  Some developers are profiting sufficiently from the tactic of not applying for planning permission to make it worth while to pay the fee in the hope that retention will be granted. This is a question of example as well as of regulation.  The State has been appalling in this regard with its proposals for Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley centre by not seeking planning permission or even checking as to whether planning permission should be applied for or engaging in a consultative process, which is less rigorous.  These are inexcusable breaches of public faith and of regulations.</P>
    <P>I urge the State to get its house in order so that it can credibly make other people apply for planning permission. In this regard, Mullaghmore is costing the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in ongoing legal fees, to retain people on contracts and other costs associated with keeping the project in abeyance.  This is nothing short of a scandal. <Col N="378" /> The Government which continues to backpedal should take stock and realise that the vast majority of people throughout the country, whatever about in the locality, favour a change of location.  The court took this into account in making its decision.  The State lacks credibility on this matter; it is being hypocritical when it states that people should comply with the planning process when it has the sticky end of the wicket.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to inform other Departments about these regulations, in particular the Department of Transport, Energy and Communcations.  As he may be aware, the railways, in particular the rolling stock, are being upgraded.  This is long overdue.  A different attitude is adopted when it comes to the procedures to be followed in replacing bridges, in particular along the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  In the case of Balbriggan there was a lack of communication between the company and the various local authority departments.  Even though it is required to obtain planning permission, the company decided not to consult with the local community, public representatives or the planning department.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the council that it received a letter in which the company stated it wished to apply for permission not to knock down the bridge but to close a road, in the same way that permission is sought to hold a bicycle race.  The council did not see any problem and granted permission.  It later discovered when it examined the matter that replacement of the bridge was being considered. When the company contacted the planning department it was informed that under the 1977 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act planning permission would be required.  It decided that it would not submit any plans, that there would be a stand-off, and that it would challenge the planning department to do its worst.  The planning department had no option but to serve a warning notice the day before the bridge was due to be demolished.  This caused enormous disruption in the town &mdash; water, electricity and telephones were cut off &mdash; all because a semi-State company <Col N="379" /> decided not to consult with the planning department to see if planning permission was required.  The planning department insisted that the company should either apply for permission or amend its plans.</P>
    <P>The Minister should issue clear instructions to all Departments and semi-State companies to ensure that there is not one set of rules for the elite, those who hold the reins of power, and another for ordinary people such as those who write to me regularly to check if they need planning permission.  They do not have the resources to meet the cost of legal fees, adopt a gung-ho attitude and flout the law.  The Minister should ensure that people are notified.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the regulations to the publication of forms and leaflets to provide information.  The present practice appears to be to produce leaflets in English or Irish only, as if we were living in an apartheid society.  Leaflets should be produced with both languages side by side.  As the Taoiseach pointed out in the Mansion House in commemorating the events of 1919, we all have a role to play in imparting information.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to these regulations.  Were it not for the vigilance of the Opposition we would not have been given this opportunity to discuss them in a democratic forum.  There is obviously a fault in the decision-making process.  Many professional groups and residents in Dublin and throughout the country have a great interest in these regulations, which have serious implications, yet we might not have been given an opportunity to discuss them.  This is a serious matter and I am glad we are having this discussion today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the regulations are available in printed form at a cost of £22.  This is very expensive at a time when the public are supposed to have access to information. <Col N="380" /> While we have an opportunity to make statements we are not allowed to table amendments or make changes.  The Minister is defending the regulations and telling us how good they are without giving us an opportunity to consider how they may be improved.  Much work has gone into producing these regulations, some of which are very good.  While I welcome their consolidation in one instrument as a move in the right direction, citizens are concerned about the planning process.</P>
    <P>I have been struck by the efforts made by various residents' associations on a voluntary basis to ensure our planning laws are respected, to preserve the environment and to cater for the needs of citizens.  They are, however, working against the odds in terms of information, resources, consultation and involvement with planning authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of leaflets to which the Minister referred.  The issue is empowerment.  The new requirements are a bad attempt to impose new controls in the system.  With whom did the Department consult in producing the regulations?  There may have been some discussion between the Department and some members of the Irish Planning Institute or employees of planning authorities, but were any discussions held with any organisation representing architects or engineers?  Were discussions held with outside interest groups?  The bulk of planning applications which have a significant effect on the environment are made by architects and engineers.</P>
    <P>I am open to correction but no draft of the regulations was submitted for their advice or comment and no consideration was given to how these regulations will be implemented by the practitioners or the cost imposed in complying with the regulations.  It is possible that some of the changes in the exempted development category have been brought about following recent decisions by An Bord Pleanála. If the Minister and the Department are unhappy with the decisions of the board, restricting the effect of its decision by implementing new regulations behind its back may have <Col N="381" /> significant implications for the authority, independence and impartiality of the board.</P>
    <P>There are two issues to which I want to refer.  One relates to exemption from planning permission of all bed and breakfast houses containing up to four bedrooms. The Minister for Tourism and Trade told me that the An Bord Pleanála decision had changed the understanding of exempted development and that resulted in the need for new regulations. In drawing up the new regulations he said a decision had to be made as to what was a material change and what might be exempted and he believed a fair balance had been struck.  He said that the fact that small bed and breakfast houses are exempt from approval for change of use under the planning regulations does not absolve them from operating in a responsible way and providing a safe and secure environment for their guests.  That is problematic and needs to be examined. If one owns a house with four bedrooms and turns it into a guesthouse, surely there must be some overall control.</P>
    <P>I will be raising on the Adjournment tonight the question of using bed and breakfast houses for homeless children. That is only one example of how bed and breakfast houses can be used and the need for regulations.  This decision will have major implications for many residential roads in Dublin and could change their whole nature.  It will have implications for community development, the environment and road traffic and there should be some level of planning in this regard.  The Minister must tell us what exactly he has in mind in changing the regulations.</P>
    <P>I agree that small businesses should not be hindered by unnecessary regulations, but it is extraordinary that we should go to the other extreme and give permission for the development of bed and breakfast establishments in this way.  The Irish Hotels Federation say the move is anti-competitive, anti-tourism and anti-consumer. It will have severe implications for both urban and rural areas.  Such unfettered development cannot be allowed and will change the quality of the <Col N="382" /> environment for many people.  It also raises a major concern in regard to standards of tourist accommodation.  One regularly hears stories about unsuitable accommodation and I would be concerned that the new regulations could add to this problem.  Accommodation premises which are used for commercial purposes should be subject to controls to ensure that high standards are maintained. Anybody's next door neighbour could convert a four bedroomed house into a commercial operation with the resultant problems I have outlined.  We should not encourage that.</P>
    <P>If this exemption is allowed, how will fire control regulations be implemented? There have been a number of house fires recently with tragic results.  For far too long we have tolerated a low standard of fire precautions in our homes and I am concerned that these exemptions will continue the operation of low standards at a time when people are becoming more conscious of fire safety regulations and the change in the regulations would have made it possible for architects and engineers to enforce compliance with the new building regulations.</P>
    <P>I concur with the sentiments of Deputy Barrett about regulations in relation to satellite TV dish aerials and I hope the Minister will comment on that matter. We may face problems with vandalism in displaying notices.  Would it not be possible for weekly notices to be displayed in local authority offices?  I understand the regulations recommend that files do not have to be kept for longer than five years.  That is a short period.  I would like the Minister's views in that regard as this could have major legal implications.</P>
    <P>The Minister is rolling back the effect of the High and Supreme Court judgments in the case relating to inland waterways involving Howard and Others <i>v.</i> the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works and any other statutory body will not require planning to improve, reconstruct or restore inland waterways.  It is essential that planning permission be required in such cases to ensure that the most sensitive approach <Col N="383" /> is adopted.  There have been reports of heavy machinery being used to clear stretches of bank along various canals without proper consideration being given to the protection of vegetation and animals, as well as conserving the visual quality of canal banks.  The Office of Public Works can erect a building of up to 40 square metres to manage or operate a canal, river or lake as well as provide a car park with up to 24 spaces.  It can also erect a building of up to 40 square metres in an area to a height of 20 metres and provide 40 car spaces on a nature reserve designated under the Wildlife Act, 1976. This commitment to concrete could damage our environment and these regulations make this possible.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that so many regulations should go through without consultation or discussion in the Dáil.  The regulations are flawed, although some of them are excellent and I welcome their consolidation. Will the Minister review the regulations having regard to the reservations raised?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and I will confine my remarks to a few areas.  I am surprised and somewhat disappointed that the regulations do not cover forestry development.  We have heard a great deal recently about extensive forestry activity throughout rural Ireland which appears to be taking place in a haphazard manner without a clear policy.  There should be reference to the planning authority or some other agency to ensure that such development takes place in a controlled fashion.  I favour forestry development. Approximately one million acres of our land is suitable for such development. However, environmentally sensitive areas should not be planted and areas of archaeological and ecological importance should not be planted without reference to the planning authorities.  I had hoped these regulations would have included forestry development.  Will the Minister give his views in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem appears to relate mainly to commercial forestry rather than small <Col N="384" /> scale forestry development.  We are all aware of cases where large companies have taken over large tracts of land and planted trees close to dwelling houses, cutting off sunlight and views for people in rural Ireland.  Rather than contributing to development and regeneration, such activity drives people out of rural areas. There should be some form of control and reference to planning authorities before major schemes proceed in the future.  On the other hand, small forestry schemes on farms are generally inoffensive to the environment and can be easily controlled.  A farmer will not plant trees to obstruct his or her view.  The problem lies mainly with large commercial interests.</P>
    <P>Work on the development of two or three golf courses in County Kerry which had been underway prior to 16 May was stopped by Kerry County Council.  Will the Minister clarify the legal position of those golf courses in respect of the regulations? Did the council have the legal authority to stop those development works?  Such intervention created a major problem in Kerry and there was a big protest about it in the affected areas.</P>
    <P>As my party's spokesperson for tourism, I received a large number of communications from the tourist industry, especially the registered sector. There are about 1,000 registered hotels and guesthouses, but thousands of unregistered guesthouses, bed and breakfast accommodation throughout the country.  People who are favourably disposed to the unregistered operators seem to have more to gain politically and I hope that factor was not part of the reasoning behind the regulations.  I sought the views of the county manager in Kerry County Council on the exemption clause and he said it would be difficult to enforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to enforce in respect of all bed and breakfast operators who make a planning application. The Minister will understand the concerns of the tourism industry and the <Col N="385" /> approved operators.  Those people who pay rates, VAT, PRSI and so forth, feel threatened by unfair competition.  Following the Minister's decision &mdash; no doubt supported by the Government &mdash; a large number of unregistered bed and breakfast operators who may never have sought approval, will form an important part of our tourism industry.  I know many such operators who provide a good service but others do not have the same standards and there is no one to enforce them.  Unsuspecting tourists will seek accommodation wherever a sign advertising it is displayed but many tourists are not aware of the difference in quality between registered and unregistered operators.  Tourists may have a good experience but a significant number may have a bad one.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade agreed that word of mouth is the best form of promotion in respect of the tourism industry.  Our good image in the area of accommodation, quality food and so on could be tarnished if a number of tourists on return to their home countries reported negatively on our accommodation because of dissatisfaction in a small number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will have to face up to this problem, it should implement a licensing system to license all accommodation and grant temporary licences to operators who wish to open for some seasons only.  Such a licensing system would ensure that the tourist would be able to obtain good standard accommodation. Following the implementation of the regulations there will be more pressure to implement a licensing system as promised in the Programme for Government on which the Government appears to have reneged.  I am sure the Minister will hear a great deal more about this problem.  The tourism industry has made a major investment, they are concerned about this problem and annoyed by the Minister's decision.  An in-depth analysis of our registered and unregistered accommodation stock is needed.  A possible solution to the accommodation problem would have been for the Minister to exempt from planning all accommodation under five rooms approved by <Col N="386" /> Bord Fáilte.  It would have ensured that unapproved operators would have to seek planning approval.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response on the issues of forestry, golf clubs and particularly bed and breakfast accommodation, the issue which has aroused the greatest opposition and interest in the tourism sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the speakers who contributed to this sometimes lively debate. However, the issues are more difficult when one has to make decisions.  While the main thrust of the contributions backed the provisions in the regulations there were reservations about some areas but no outright opposition to a single provision, which is a tribute to what we have sought to achieve by way of the regulations.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to all the statements on the regulations, but I did not hear anything to alter my view that they are a positive and constructive step. The regulations have effected a necessary consolidation of secondary planning law and have introduced important new provisions. They will reinforce the open character of the planning process and should make life a good deal simpler for anybody who has dealings with the planning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address, briefly, some of the matters raised by Deputies.  Deputy Barrett questioned the appropriateness of regulations of this nature being made without the need for confirmation by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In effect, this is a return of a debate we have regularly when passing legislation.  If the proposition he advanced was accepted, it would mean that every minor detail of the regulations would have to be considered in this House.  I do not believe it is seriously suggested that it is necessary or appropriate for this House to discuss the content of planning application forms, to decide the bodies to which copies of draft development plans are to be sent or to work out the precise scope of every exemption from planning permission requirements.  No parliament <Col N="387" /> would contemplate becoming involved in primary legislation debates on matters of that kind.  The reality is that subordinate legislation is necessary for the effective operation of our legislative process.  I take issue with Deputy Barrett, therefore, when he says that there is an attempt to push through these regulations. I cannot accept either that it would have been appropriate to deal with the issues covered by the regulations by way of a Bill, as they relate largely to comparatively minor matters of administrative detail.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Frances Fitzgerald expressed reservations about allowing up to four bedrooms in a house to be used for bed and breakfast purposes without planning permission.  Deputies O'Donnell and Sargent felt that the new exemption might err on the side of being too liberal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan seemed more realistic in his contribution.  Following his discussions with the county manager, he accepted, there would be difficulties in regard to it.  It is important to take account of the fact that, to date, bed and breakfast operators were not subject to planning and the decision I have taken does not interfere with their obligation to obtain fire certificates, commencement orders and to comply with hygiene regulations. Deputies should not take it for granted that people are perfect just because they are registered or that unregistered operators are imperfect. Some of the statistics disprove that contention. Control under the planning Acts is concerned with evaluating the acceptability of particular development proposals by reference to the proper planning and development of the area concerned.  They are not concerned with issues such as hygiene standards or fire safety, which are regulated through other statutory codes.</P>
    <P>My conclusion, following careful consideration of all the issues involved, was that small-scale bed and breakfast operations, involving not more than four guest bedrooms, are not significant in terms of the proper planning and <Col N="388" /> development of the areas in which they are situated and need not, therefore, be subject to planning permission requirements.</P>
    <P>The exemption of the regulations relates only to planning permission requirements and does not affect other statutory provisions such as the 1991 building regulations and the Fire Services Act.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, the planning exemption we are talking about relates to the use of a standard house to provide a form of accommodation much sought-after by tourists.  I cannot see how the public interest would be served by subjecting such premises to a requirement to obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett, O'Donnell, Sargent and Fitzgerald all referred to the new requirement for applicants to erect site notices and doubts were expressed about the practicality of the new arrangements. I am satisfied that a requirement to erect a site notice does not constitute an unreasonable burden on applicants, although it will, of course, require them to ensure that the notice is kept in place for the one month period and is replaced or renewed if it becomes illegible, defaced or removed.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised planning authorities, in guidance notes, that it would be appropriate to check on compliance with the new site notice requirements when the normal site inspection is being carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also suggested it would be appropriate if the responsibility for publishing newspaper notice of applications rested on the planning authority. I believe, however, that the primary responsibility for giving notice of a planning application should rest with the applicant, and it was against this background that I looked at various options for improving the existing notice arrangements. The conclusion reached, after examination of various options, was that a dual obligation to publish newspaper notice and erect a site notice was the best approach.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to the fact that the regulations require An Bord <Col N="389" /> Pleanála's weekly list of appeals received and decided to be made available only at the board's offices in Dublin.  However, the relevant provision, article 62, also provides for copies of the list to be sent to interested persons and bodies.  It is open to any body, including a planning authority, to arrange with the board that a copy of each weekly list will be sent to it.</P>
    <P>On the question of unauthorised developments, I indicated earlier that the higher fee for retention applications is merely an additional disincentive &mdash; the planning Acts already contain a formidable array of enforcement powers allowing action to be taken against development carried out without the proper planning permission.  If a developer carries out development without permission, he or she is open to a High Court or Circuit Court order for removal of the works.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell expressed the view that the exemptions for advertisements on business premises are confusing.  I do not accept this, however, as the exemption for such premises is contained in one relatively brief class in the regulations.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that every sign, apart from a brass plate should need planning permission but I have put an overall limit of five square metres on the area size that can be displayed on the front of a business premises. This is an addition to the existing limit of 0.3 square metres of signs per 1 metre length of frontage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also questioned the need for certain types of State development to be excluded from normal planning controls on security grounds.  If we lived in a perfect world it would be possible for us to subject all State development proposals to the requirements of the planning process.  As we are only too well aware, this is not the case, and a category of State projects must, for compelling reasons of national security, remain outside the development control system.  I have gone as far as possible in ensuring public involvement with such development, by the alternative notice <Col N="390" /> procedure under Part XIII of the regulations.</P>
    <P>On the question of satellite dishes, I am satisfied that the restrictions imposed in the interests of visual amenity will not, in the vast majority of cases, pose technical problems in terms of line of sight. If, in a particular case, a satellite dish has to be put in a visually obtrusive location, it will, of course, be open to the householder to seek planning permission.</P>
    <P>As to domestic extensions, I would like to explain that the new limit which requires not less than 25 square metres of open space to be left at the rear of the house was introduced to prevent cases of excessive plot coverage, where extensions effectively use up all the open space at the back of the house.  I do not believe that this new limitation will prove unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Deputy Sargent welcomes ending the exemption for golf courses.  I should explain in this connection that the restriction on exemption where previously open land is enclosed restates a provision of the 1977 planning regulations.  Works which commenced before 16 May remain exempt, where they were exempt under the previous regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked whether the provisions of Article 36 of the regulations dealing with the availability for inspection of documents relating to planning applications might not cause planning authorities to destroy files when the period for exemption or inspection is over.  Article 36 is identical to the provision it replaced except that it includes the additional requirement that submissions or observations received in relation to an application are to be made available.  I do not see how this would lead to the destruction of files when the inspection period is over.  In practice, planning authorities retain files for considerably longer than the period during which they are required to be available for inspection.  The Deputy should note that section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1994, which I will be bringing into operation shortly, requires local authorities to provide for the proper management <Col N="391" /> and care of local records.  The local records to which the requirements of section 65 apply are extensive and include maps, plans, drawings and files held by a local authority in the course of its business.</P>
    <P>As to the exemptions which the regulations provide for in respect of certain works carried out by the Office of Public Works, they are largely concerned with minor works such as the maintenance of canals which, because of their nature, it is not necessary to subject to the planning requirements.  Since 1990, planning permission is required for afforestation involving more than 200 hectares.  This, with other areas relating to forestry development, is at present the subject of a review by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland.  My Department is also involved in that review.  If it emerges in the review that there is a need for further intervention as far as the planning process is concerned, I will have no hesitation in doing that.</P>

    <Title>An Bord Bia Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Bia will incorporate CBF and the food functions of An Bord Tráchtála.  It is very important, therefore, that An Bord Bia works closely with An Bord Tráchtála to ensure there is no duplication of marketing and services.  I foresee some problems with this proposal.  It could lead to duplication, as referred to by the Minister and all contributors to the debate.  To put one segment of An Bord Tráchtála under a different agency will pose practical problems and this should be carefully monitored by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers said it would be sensible to include the marketing functions <Col N="392" /> of Bord Bainne and Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the functions of the new board. There may be reasons for that which the Minister will refer to later, but this would result in various agencies &mdash; Bord Bainne is a private company &mdash; selling Irish food produce abroad.  The Minister said that provision will be made for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to become involved in this work.  Why not make such provision now?  I have been in the House for a few years and whenever a Minister says that provision will be made, that is the end of the matter.  I do not believe the Minister intends to include Bord Iascaigh Mhara with An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give the number of major food companies such as the Kerry Group who perhaps seek advice from Bord Tráchtála, CBF or Bord Bainne but who market their own products?  What role does the Minister envisage for these companies in the context of a focused marketing drive, the elimination of duplication and the allocation of available resources?  Will the new board co-operate with these companies and perhaps farm out some of their marketing functions to them?  Perhaps the Minister will refer to these matters when replying.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest this year's report of the Kerry Group and I suggest that the Minister read it.  It is in favour of the value added product and is looking at new opportunities and markets.  It sees marketing, packaging and promotion as strong points and is doing this work itself. No doubt its competitors such as Golden Vale, Dairygold and so on will follow suit.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to employment in the food sector, which declined from about 44,500 in 1985 to 37,000 in 1994. This is due in part to better technology, in many cases grant aided.  To improve quality and efficiency we seem to be shedding jobs.  In the National Plan there is a commitment to create 9,500 jobs in the food sector in the next five years.  Unless we can identify value-added products and different market niches, the opportunities will not exist to create those jobs. There is need for greater marketing and research and I am glad the Minister has <Col N="393" /> made available extra money for research purposes.  As a result of lack of funding for Teagasc under Joe Rea in the late 1980s, research almost came to an end. We fell behind countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands in terms of food production and we lacked opportunities to develop further products in the food industry.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the global aspect of marketing and selling food abroad, but little mention has been made, even in the Minister's speech, of small operators such as cheese makers on farms in Kerry.  I know a number of them. These people experience major problems selling their product in the local market and abroad.  I am familiar with one case in which the product is marketed and sold abroad, but most small operators fail due to lack of expertise in marketing which results in reduced possibilities of selling their product, particularly on the British and European markets.  Is there provision within the various subsidiary companies for the small operator?  The small operator should be assisted in packaging and labelling their produce as it is in this area that many of them fail.  There was mention of Farmhouse Pantry in Mayo, a label which covers a range of products from various operators.  This label is operating successfully and could be a model for other groups to come together to market their product.</P>
    <P>We must look to the future of the agri-food industry in the context of trade growth resulting from GATT &mdash; I emphasised this point yesterday evening.  Extra jobs will be created only through the production of added value products, which is being undertaken by the Kerry Group.  Professor Séamus Sheehy recently said that Irish farmers and agribusiness would need to turn their strategic focus on these opportunities and much of Irish agriculture could compete in more open markets, but we must rethink our attitude to food production.</P>
    <P>The penetration of Irish agri-food products in mainland Europe is low.  A major effort is needed to improve performance. I hope this initiative will help Irish exporters to increase their penetration <Col N="394" /> of the European market in the context of GATT and the greater opportunities that will present in Europe and throughout the world.  However, there will be greater competition from New Zealand, Argentina and other countries who will bring into the market a lower cost product of high quality.  There are about 3,000 employees in the Department of Agriculture in New Zealand, most of whom travel around the world selling their product in the marketplace. We will face major competition from these countries.  Whereas GATT will present us with great opportunities, if we are to exploit those opportunities we need more products, we need to exploit the market and fight for our niche in the market.  I am glad that adequate funding has been provided because, as the Minister is aware, the budget for An Bord Tráchtála this year has decreased by £3 million which will affect the presence of small operators in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Our markets today may not be there tomorrow unless we continue to convince the customers that we are producing quality goods and fight to retain those markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which will set up the Irish Food Board, as it will be known in most countries outside Ireland.  A rationalisation with regard to the sales agencies that operate on behalf of this country, particularly in the food sector, is long overdue.  I agree with Deputy Deenihan that post-GATT the situation will be much different with regard to competition and the markets we will seek to enter.  We should exploit our major advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not made sufficient use of our environmental position.  We are probably the greenest country in the world with regard to agricultural production but we have not exploited that position.  In many European markets Irish products can command a high price but we have a major problem with our seasonal production, particularly meat and meat products.  Few of the people involved in that business are prepared to take on <Col N="395" /> customers for a full year.  They will supply them when produce is plentiful but when supplies become short, and margins tighten, they will not.  The net result is that someone else takes a large share of what should be our markets.  It is obvious that certain groups within the food industry, have proved very successful.  An Bord Bainne was one of the most successful marketing organisations through the years and it built up a reputation in regard to service, reliability and the quality of the product it delivers.  The success of Kerrygold butter in Germany is a prime example of what can be achieved with proper marketing in this area.</P>
    <P>Other agencies will become involved as a result of the establishment of An Bord Bia, including CBF.  That is a wise decision because we are mainly producers of dairy products, beef, sheepmeat and a certain amount of pigmeat. The other smaller industries associated with the agricultural area such as deer production, etc., are in their infancy and it will take time for them to develop to a point where they can supply a continual market.</P>
    <P>CBF has a double role to play, it is responsible for promoting our meat and meat products and exports of livestock. Indeed, perhaps there is a need to consider having a direct connection between the horse industry and the other promotional industries here because that is also another major source of income to farming.  People tend to think of CBF from the point of view of its efforts in the area of dead meat sales.  We all support that area to the maximum but there is a limit to the type of product that can be sold in processed form and it would be a serious misjudgment of future market trends if we allowed any action to be taken that would diminish our presence in the third country live cattle markets. Indeed, because of our involvement in those markets, we have received dead meat contracts which, in other circumstances, would have gone to our competitors in Australia, New Zealand or the Eastern bloc countries.  It is important for those responsible for the promotion <Col N="396" /> of our livestock to remember that there is a role to be played by exporters and those who have been vocal in criticising that area outside this House should consider how much of the product exported live would be of use to the added valud market in Europe.  The answer is very little.  In regard to our livestock production and our estimates for future production, it is imperative to maintain our presence in the live cattle and sheep market places.</P>
    <P>It is now accepted that if it had not been for the competition provided by this market over the past 12 or 18 months, farmers would have experienced serious problems in disposing of the livestock available for processing.  This week, some of the factories that claim to be seeking livestock refused to take them from farmers because they believed that prices would decrease further in the weeks ahead.  That attitude changed, however, when they discovered that live exporting would resume again in the next week to ten days.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State and the officials in his Department will see a role for a proper balance between both ways of disposal. We all wish to see the maximum added value taken from our livestock production but while times have been good in livestock production over the past 12 or 18 months, by the end of the 1990s, we will need to be involved in as many markets as possible for the disposal of our livestock because of increased numbers and the possible changes in regard to subsidies and other income supplements.</P>
    <P>The involvement of Bord Iascaigh Mhara is welcome but I hope that in promoting our fishing industry we do not forget the tourism aspect.  I am happy that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of the Marine and the Department of Tourism and Trade will be represented on this board.  That is imperative because we are in the business of doing a co-ordinated promotion of Ireland.  Deputy Deenihan pointed out that some groups have been successful in carrying out their own promotion and that has already been seen. The fact that An Bord Glas will be <Col N="397" /> involved also means that the mushroom industry, for instance, which has been very successful in promoting sales of its products abroad, will make a sizeable contribution in regard to what is required to penetrate the markets.</P>
    <P>The market development for Irish food and drink products is important also.  We are all aware of the success of some of our drink products throughout the world, due mainly to expert marketing and a superior product.  We must produce the highest quality product with the maximum added value and emphasise that the product has been produced in a clean environment.  We are all health conscious and it is imperative to maintain this status.  Anyone involved in damaging the Credibility of our products, agricultural or otherwise, must be treated with the maximum severity by the powers of the State. At one time some of our competitors cast slurs on our products.  It is imperative that we counteract these.</P>
    <P>The Bill will affect the 37,000 jobs in the food industry.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable us to sell a first quality product at a competitive price.  We must look at markets outside the EU and see where we are going in the future.  Great credit is due to those who market Baileys. It sells in top quality markets because the buyer appreciates the quality of the product.  Irish whiskey has found an expanding market.</P>
    <P>As regards the appointment of the board, members should have the necessary knowledge to enable them contribute rather than having a vested interest in the industry.  Such people could not be objective and would be forced to look at things from their own position.  Many suitable people could be appointed to the board who may have retired or who may have moved to other areas.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has also a role to play in the promotion of food on the home market and in arranging, where possible, for the substitution of imports with home produced products.  In some cases we import products similar to those we export and there is something wrong with <Col N="398" /> that.  The need for proper promotion is just as important at home as it is abroad. We have an opportunity to set the guidelines for the future development of the food industry.  It is the blueprint we will use in the years ahead.  We have a reputation to maintain and anyone damaging that should not be allowed to participate in promotions run by An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>We have a large horse industry which should be supported.  The showjumping team had major successes in the UK.  The industry could act as an ambassador for us.  In promoting our country we are entitled to use all available aids.  We have many great ambassadors in sport and other areas and involving such people in promotional work would be of enormous benefit to the food industry.  Some people have been used for promotional work on the home market and this has proved successful for the companies involved. We should look at the funding of the food industry and its production mechanism. There is need for State and EU funding to enable those involved in the industry to produce superior products.</P>
    <P>We will assess An Bord Bia in the years ahead on the market share it has acquired.  I have no doubt that those appointed to it will have the well-being of the employees in the industry at heart and will promote Ireland as a producer of food and food products of a quality not produced anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I know BBC commentators have trouble pronouncing long Irish words but they could even have considerable difficulty with two words.  Córas Beostoic agus Feola promoted the sale of beef and lamb.  During my time as Minister for Agriculture that was their sole area of jurisdiction.  Despite our <Col N="399" /> efforts in the Department we could not expand their mandate.  However, I am glad to see progress has been made.  A few years ago the board's mandate was extended to include pigmeat.  It was ridiculous that Córas Tráchtála was marketing some Irish products and the meat board was promoting others.  I never understood the logic of that.  It is a common-sense approach to bring everything together under one board.  Regrettably BIM has not agreed to the inclusion of fish products.  I do not understand why that is so.</P>
      <P>For as long as I can remember, marketing has been the Achilles heel of Irish agriculture.  As a race we do not appear to have great marketing skills.  I may be criticised for saying that but it appears to be the case.  This is due to the fact that we never really had to sell on the open market.  I do not know if this point has been alluded to by previous speakers. Our membership of the EU gave us access to the intervention system whereby products which could not be sold on the open market were placed in intervention; in other words, they were put in stores and the producer got a guaranteed price for them.  People did not have to try to sell their products as they still got money for them.  Although it was the backbone of Irish agriculture for 20 years, this system was disastrous in many ways.  It made us lazy and complacent and we did not have to go out and sell our products, which as every salesman knows, is a very tough job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in the position where those artificial mechanisms, the intervention system, are slowly and surely being removed through the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the implementation of the new GATT deal. For 20 years we enjoyed a system of protectionism for agricultural products but from now on we will have to compete on the open market.  It may not yet have dawned on many people, particularly those in the agricultural sector, that some pain will be attached to this.  A great deal of pain will be attached to it if we do <Col N="400" /> not market our products efficiently and better than we have done to date.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago we depended on two principals, Larry Goodman and Séamus Purcell, for the sale of beef.  They did not rely on middlemen or salesmen to sell their products: they met Heads of States and Ministers from other European countries, the Far East and elsewhere and sold their products.  We do not have the same structure of market operators which exists in other countries.  For example, the New Zealanders are brilliant at selling their product in other countries.  They are able to sell their product at a very low price because they do not have support systems such as intervention or subsidies &mdash; they got rid of those years ago.  If we are not able to sell our products then the food sector and the agricultural industry in general will suffer.  We have been sheltered for many years and we are now entering the real world.  I am delighted with this very necessary development, we will sink or swim depending on our marketing ability.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the way the board will be established.  I disagree entirely with the concept of giving interest bodies, nominating bodies or whatever one calls them the right to nominate people to a board.  This is defeatism, and the Minister should reconsider this aspect of the Bill. From my experience of being in charge of 12 to 14 State boards, it is wrong to allow nominating bodies to put a person on a board without reference to the Minister. The sanction of the Minister should be sought but this does not always happen in practice; once a person is nominated he or she goes on the board almost automatically. This system is disastrous and defeatist.  Very often people are nominated to boards as repayment for favours done.  This is the worst possible way to constitute a board.</P>
    <P>The Minister should nominate the members of the board.  It does not matter whether five members of the board come from one organisation while there is no representative of another organisation or whether they represent a sectoral interest.  What is important is that the 11 <Col N="401" /> people serving on the board know the food industry and the food business.  The best people must be appointed to the board, and the Minister must not be dictated to by pressure groups.  If the sectional interest groups to which I referred are allowed to nominate one or two members then we will have a poor quality board and the purpose of the exercise will be defeated.</P>
    <P>If the board is not good then the implementation of policies, the selection of personnel and the entire operation will be in dire trouble from day one.  I want to get this message across clearly to the Minister.  I am sure that like me previous Ministers and Ministers in other Departments have had the same experience in this area.  Those of us who were in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and had dealings with some boards will agree with me on balance. They may not admit this in public but I think they would do so in private: some of them may be afraid of the pressure groups and of being hauled over the coals.  However, that is part of life. Having regard to its remit, CBF did a wonderful job in recent years.  We could not get a better chief executive than Paddy Moore, an outstanding individual. He is the type of person we need on the board.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to An Bord Bainne.  While it has done a good job, its work has not been as competitive as that of CBF.  For much of the time An Bord Bainne has dealt in commodity products which are easier to dispose of than consumer products.  One cannot sell a consumer product unless the consumer and the public want it, while one can get rid of a commodity product with the aid of EC subsidies.  In fairness, it has to sell some commodities on the open market &mdash; I do not want to be critical of it &mdash; but one has to compete in that market.</P>
    <P>The GATT agreement will cause considerable difficulties because we will be competing against New Zealand, Australia, South America, Canada and the United States for the sale of agricultural products.  When one considers that the price of beef here is 115p per pound while <Col N="402" /> it is 50p per pound in Australia, 35p per pound in South America and 75p per pound in the United States and Canada one can see that we will have a problem in years to come.  Under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the new GATT agreement we will have to compete with producers who can sell beef at those prices.  Those in the milk industry will have to compete against New Zealand where milk can be produced for as little as 20-25p per gallon.  If our dairy farmers were asked to produce milk for this price most of them would go out of business; they could not operate on that basis.</P>
    <P>The dear food policy in the EU suits Ireland.  We export 80 per cent of all we produce and it is the massive inflow of money primarily from our agricultural export trade which keeps us going &mdash; it keeps cars on the road and enables people to build good quality houses.  If we cannot compete with countries able to produce those commodities at a much lower price, we are in dire trouble; that is where marketing enters.  If we cannot sell on the open market we are really in trouble.  However, we have ability or intuition &mdash; I suppose the word is &ldquo;flair&rdquo;&mdash; if we put our minds to it, we can do it. I have confidence in people's ability to do it but I would not take it for granted. The days of beef mountains, skimmed milk powder mountains, butter mountains, wine and olive oil lakes, are coming to an end.  We will no longer have a safety net or be able to dump them into intervention as it was described; we will have to sell such produce.</P>
    <P>The present alternative, if people cannot put such produce into intervention, is that they will be given increased headage grants and increased premia for cattle, sheep and other products.  Under the GATT Agreement that will end, those grants can be paid for so many years only; we are all sufficiently astute to know that.  People have been given the impression by politicians, without naming any, that these payments will continue indefinitely; they will not.  I predict they will be almost totally phased out by the end of this century, which is <Col N="403" /> when marketing will come into play.  We will then need a strong Bord Bia or, as it will be known worldwide, the Irish Food and Drinks Board, let us not forget the drinks aspect of it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we have a thriving drinks industry abroad.  I know you, a Cheann Comhairle, are not a man for visiting pubs, but you will be interested to know that, at the last count, there were 17 Irish pubs in Paris and that the number is increasing almost daily.  Last week I was in Warsaw as a member of the Council of Europe &mdash; it was not a junket; it was hard work &mdash; where there are now two Irish pubs, a place one would not expect to find them.  There are also pubs in Moscow and all sorts of other venues worldwide.  For instance, Guinness and Smithwicks sell their product worldwide. There are three or four Guinness breweries in Nigeria; we are not exporting Guinness; they are brewing it out there. As the Minister of State will know, the local drink there is a large bottle of Guinness. I understand they also have breweries in Malaysia where Guinness and Smithwicks, or their subsidiaries, play their part.  There is a strange contradiction in that we were the people who created, if that is the correct description, whiskey, uisce beatha and that our Celtic brothers in Scotland can sell 50 to 100 bottles of whiskey worldwide for every one we produce.  Perhaps it is a matter of marketing although I think it is more a case of getting the blend right; we tend to deal in malt whiskeys whereas they go for blended whiskeys, not as severe on the palate, which appeal to Americans and others worldwide.  Suffice it to say that the product we created is now outselling us by 50:1 or 100:1 worldwide. Those are the vagaries; you win some, you lose some, and we lost out on that one.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you welcomed here this morning a delegation from Poland.  I mention this to illustrate further the problems that will arise under the GATT Agreement and the Common Agricultural Policy for the food industry. That delegation was here primarily to <Col N="404" /> lobby the Government and politicians about Poland's entry to the European Union.  Not alone does Poland want to become a member of the European Union but countries like Czechoslovakia, Romania, the Ukraine, even Russia itself all want to join; even if we do not like it, they will be allowed to enter in the not too distant future because they are part of Europe.  Poland is very confident of gaining entry because the Germans want them in.  One wonders why bearing in mind the trauma, the financial and social upheaval when Germany was reunited? However, the Germans want a buffer state between themselves and the Russians; history is repeating itself.  The chances are that, if the Germans want the Poles in, they will be in which will place tremendous pressures on our food industry because they will be huge exporters of the type of food we produce. There are well over two million farmers in Poland alone, corresponding to approximately one-third of the total farmers in the European Union.  When one considers all the farmers in the bread basket of Europe, the Ukraine, Romania, Russia and the other countries I mentioned, this means will we have masses of food, a grossly over-supplied market.  It also means we must be able to sell it successfully to survive.  Our produce is at least as good as that of other countries but it is not always much better. Perhaps Polish beef is just as good as ours, it depends on taste.  Continentals do not like meat containing fat, which means we must trim it off.  We must ensure that our animals have that lean, hungry look.  It is an open market and we may well be over-estimating the value of our product.  However, in future we shall have to sell internationally in competition with goods produced elsewhere cheaper than here.  That is why it is so important to have a very good Bord Bia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Members who participated in this debate.  I acknowledge the contribution of my constituency colleague and former Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="405" /> Deputy Deasy, and his encouragement of the concept of An Bord Bia. In doing so he also pointed out the difficulties facing the Irish food industry and, in many ways, drew a very realistic picture.</P>
      <P>In the time available I will deal with as many as possible of the points raised by Members.  It appears there is misunderstanding by some Members, one relates to the distinction to be drawn between promotion and market development on the one hand and selling on the other.  As with CBF and An Bord Tráchtála at present, it is the former, not the latter, function that will constitute the area of activity of An Bord Bia.  It would be contrary to European Union rules for a State agency to sell a product itself; that is not proposed.  The promotion and market development functions of An Bord Bia are set out in detail in section 8 of the Bill.  Selling is a matter for the private sector.  Many firms will continue to promote their products, as at present, through advertising and other means.</P>
      <P>In future when a firm feels the need for centralised back-up in its promotion and market development activities An Bord Bia will be able to provide it for branded or non-branded products.  That is what existing agencies do at present but, from now on, it will be done in a unified manner which will exploit the synergies between the markets for different food and beverages.  An Bord Bia will also have generic promotion functions.</P>
      <P>Another fundamental area in which Deputies seem to be under some misunderstanding is the extent to which the Bill reflects the totality of the recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on the food industry and the nature of some of these recommendations. It is clear from the debate that many Deputies think the objective of the Bill should be to give effect to all the recommendations of the expert group.  It is not the intention of the group nor is it necessary that legislation be enacted to deal with every recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the legislation is to give <Col N="406" /> effect to one of the recommendations made by the expert group, that is that a single food promotion agency be established. Contrary to what has been suggested by some Deputies, the expert group did not recommend a full scale food development board.  Furthermore, when established, An Bord Bia will be supported by other development strategies recommended by the expert group. Most of these strategies have been embodied in the special Structural Fund sub-programme which the expert group recommended should be drawn up and which is now being examined by the EU Commission.  It is worth mentioning also that through that sub-programme, substantial funding will be provided for all the food industry's development needs, including research and development and An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked about the position of An Bord Bainne.  Despite its title, it is not a State agency but a private firm. The Bill relates to the unification of the functions of State agencies.  Currently Bord Bainne carries out a great deal of promotion on its own account but is free to call on the services of An Bord Tráchtála where it thinks appropriate, just as any other private sector firm can. That situation will continue but An Bord Bia instead of An Bord Tráchtála will be the organisation in the food sector.</P>
    <P>I was also asked whether there would be a statutory levy on milk for the purpose of An Bord Bia's activities in the dairy sector.  As Deputies will be aware, statutory levies apply only on livestock. The Bill gives power to introduce similar types of levies on other agricultural products but I stress that under section 45 this could only be done after consultation with the interests involved and following a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are, as of now, no plans to introduce such a levy on milk and processors of dairy products will thus be charged fees for services they may seek from An Bord Bia.  I hope this clarifies the position in the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>On the question of the treatment to be given to fish products the House will agree that pending the outcome of the <Col N="407" /> review of BIM's activities, which is currently underway, it would not be appropriate to transfer any of the agency's functions to An Bord Bia.  However, provision is being made in section 9 to enable such a transfer to take place at a later date.  In the meantime, by virtue of sections 2 and 11, An Bord Bia will be in a position to provide for the fish sector the same type of service which is currently provided by An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised questions about assigning functions relating to quality assurance, hygiene and safety to An Bord Bia.  While section 8 confers specific functions on the new board in regard to quality assurance, the House will agree that it would be inappropriate for an agency whose primary function is promotion and market development also to have a regulatory role in regard to safety and hygiene.  Contrary to what has been suggested, there is a very good working relationship between my Department and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>There was a number of questions about An Bord Bia's internal arrangements such as the number of subsidiary boards, levels of staff pay, how various sectors would be dealt with administratively etc. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, in his introductory speech said that the proper approach when setting up a board is to provide it with a clear framework as is being done in this Bill and then let it go on with the job.  The Bill contains the framework and seeks to avoid what could be regarded as excessive bureaucracy by refraining as much as possible from legislating for internal detail.  There is, however, one area where some internal detail is unavoidable and that is in the meat and livestock sector.  The requirement here, in line with the report of the expert group on the food industry, is not to lose the functions and arrangements which have worked well in CBF but to transfer these to the relevant subsidiary board of An Bord Bia.  That necessitated the transportation of a number of <Col N="408" /> detailed provisions from the existing CBF legislation.</P>
    <P>There was a question about the reference in the Minister's speech to the &ldquo;representational pattern&rdquo; implied by the carryover of CBF levy arrangements into An Bord Bia.  That reference relates only to the meat and livestock subsidiary board, the representative pattern for which is set out in section 15 (3).  Deputies will note that section 13 (2) obliges the board of An Bord Bia to set up a subsidiary board when so directed by the Minister and allows it to set one up on its own initiative with the consent of the Minister.  The Minister will also have powers to specify functions to be delegated to a subsidiary board.  As Deputies can see from section 13 (2) these functions can include both collection and spending of levy proceeds. These provisions are designed to ensure that in the case of the meat and livestock subsidiary board, both of these functions can be carried out by that body.</P>
    <P>As regards other possible subsidiary boards, the Minister made it clear that he would expect a subsidiary board for prepared consumer foods to be set up. This is a specific recommendation of the expert group on the food industry.  The Minister would intend to allow the main board to formulate views, which he would then consider, as to whether any further subsidiary boards would be established.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of making appointments to the main board.  As I have said, the system of nominations is being retained for the subsidiary board for meat and livestock because of the desirability of carrying over the important elements of the CBF system to that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to the main board that consideration does not <Col N="409" /> apply.  The functions of the main board are too broad for the nominations approach to be appropriate and the debate has shown that at least some Deputies appreciate that point.  The persons appointed by the Minister, as section 14 (5) provides, will be persons having knowledge or experience of the food industry.  The intention is to appoint persons of the highest calibre who can make a real contribution.  While not nominated by organisations, they will be broadly representative of the various sectors concerned with food.  The appointment of members by the Minister follows the practice adopted in the case of other agencies such as Forfás and Forbairt and I am convinced that in this case it is also the best method.</P>
      <P>Other questions which have been raised relate to the issues of orders for which an affirmative resolution of the Oireachtas is not required, to the alleged absence of controls on the levels of fees which the board can charge for its services to the arbitrary power of the Minister to fire the chairman or members of the board and to the location of An Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>There are three sections in the Bill which empower the Minister to make an order without an affirmative resolution of the Oireachtas.  These are sections 5, 9 and 10.  Section 5 relates to the fixing of the establishment day and Deputies will agree that this is not an issue which needs to be referred back to the Oireachtas.  The two other sections provide respectively for the transfer to the board of functions currently exercised by other bodies and to the assignment to it of additional functions which are incidental to or consequential on the functions already conferred by sections 7 to 9.  I do not justify this solely on the basis of what has been done already.  In both instances the principles will have already been set and referral back to the Oireachtas should not be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of controls over the levels of fees to be charged by the board, the power to charge fees is contained in section 12 (1), but as Deputies will see at <Col N="410" /> section 12 (2) the approval of the Minister for the amounts to be charged is required.</P>
    <P>With regard to the so-called arbitrary power of the Minister to fire board members, this is to provide against any contingency in which such a power might prove necessary and it is a normal provision in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The question of where An Bord Bia is to be located has been raised several times in the House.  The position is that in order to allow the new board the say to which it is entitled in this matter it will not be dealt with until the legislation has been enacted and the board is in place.</P>
    <P>During the debate it was suggested that An Bord Bia should have responsibility for certain non-edible products and that this could be achieved by extending the definition of &ldquo;food&rdquo;.  While I appreciate the thinking behind this suggestion, to adopt it would go beyond the limits of credulity.  The Attorney General would also have a difficulty with what would be an artificial definition.</P>
    <P>On the question of co-operation between the development agency and the marketing agency in the food sector, section 11 of the Bill requires the board to co-operate with other agencies which have marketing functions.  While there is no formal provision in relation to co-operation between Forbairt and An Bord Bia I intend to ensure that there is co-operation between the promotion and development agency.  The Industrial Development Act, 1993 provides for the establishment of an institutional link between Forfás and An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to small operators.  These come within the remit of An Bord Bia.  I attach considerable importance to the need to develop niche products.  Last year the food unit of ABT concentrated on the independent grocery sector.  In the past we concentrated on the multiples and there was a roadshow which moved around Britain.  Part of the reason ABT has become more interested in independent grocers is that at present independent stores account for 3 per cent of all sales and 10 per cent of food sales but the graph indicates that by the end of the century they will account for 20 per <Col N="411" /> cent of food sales.  By definition, these independent grocers &mdash; they are in the main convenience stores which open early in the morning and remain open until late in the evening &mdash; attract clients who probably have above average income; they work during the day and like to do their shopping in the evening. This sector has great potential and it is my intention and that of the industry to promote it.</P>
    <P>On the question of my approach to the development of the food industry, I am pursuing the strategy set out by the expert group whose report constitutes the most wide-ranging and comprehensive study ever undertaken of the food industry. The group was representative of all sectors of the industry and in the course of its deliberations it examined all aspects of the food industry.  These included the problem of seasonality of raw material supplies, over-reliance on intervention and commodity markets, investment aid policy, the institutional framework within which the industry operates and the issue of research and technology as well as the external and domestic factors likely to influence the industry's future development.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of its examination the group made a substantial number of recommendations all with the same basic objective, that is, to promote within the food industry a sustained switch to a consumer oriented policy.  The group also set targets against which progress in the achievement of that objective could be measured and it further recommended a more integrated approach towards the provision of development aid and other supports for the industry.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the expert group's report was to authorise the drawing up of a new national programme for the food industry based on the group's recommendations.  Work on the preparation of that programme which has been undertaken under my supervision during the past few months is now complete.</P>
    <P>The new programme which will cover the period up to 1999 will take the form <Col N="412" /> of a special sub-programme in the next round of Structural Funds.  The £7 million funding which I announced some weeks ago for institutional research and development and which relates to one year only represents but a small element of the total amount to be provided under the sub-programme.  Pending finalisation of the negotiations with the EU Commission I am not in a position to say precisely what the total amount will be but it will be substantial.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who have taken part in the debate.  Their contributions, without exception, were constructive. While there is disagreement on specific points there is a belief in the food industry and in our produce and that we can make progress in terms of job creation in this sector.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to increase the aggregate sum of moneys which may be paid to An Bord Tráchtála. The Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991 limits the amount of non-repayable grants, which may be paid to An Bord Tráchtála, to £400 million.  This Bill, which seeks to raise that statutory limit to £650 million, is routine in the <Col N="413" /> sense that it arises periodically in relation to most State agencies.  It does not imply any long term commitment to provide funding at a particular level and does not bind either the Government or the Oireachtas to any financial commitments. It should be seen, therefore, as, essentially, a technical measure.</P>
    <P>The current aggregrate, or cumulative sum, paid from the Exchequer to An Bord Tráchtála, and its predecessor, An Coras Tráchtála, since 1959, now exceeds £370 million and is due to reach £400 million before the end of this year.  In this Bill, I propose to raise the aggregate sum to £650 million in order to cover expenditure anticipated at present, including that incorporated in the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999.</i></P>
    <P>For that reason, it is highly desirable that this Bill be passed in this session. Otherwise, arrangements might have to be made for An Bord Tráchtála to undertake short term borrowings to maintain its operations until the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Irish exporters performed extremely well in 1993 in the face of exceptionally difficult conditions. They are to be congratulated for having attained record levels of sales &mdash; for indigenous companies, in particular, it was a demonstration of exceptional resilience and determination.</P>
    <P>Last year's export sales were won in the face of the most unfavourable trade environment for many years, with many of our key trade markets, principally in Europe, in recession.  In some markets, such as the UK and the United States, recovery was slow.  World trade grew by only 2.6 per cent less than half the growth of the previous year.  This meant that Irish companies had to significantly increase their market share at the expense of their international competitors.</P>
    <P>In 1993, our total exports rose by almost 9 per cent to an estimated £18.1 billion; this represents a cumulative increase of 23 per cent over the past five years.</P>
    <P>Exports from the indigenous sector, where An Bord Tráchtála concentrates its efforts, grew to an estimated £3.9 billion <Col N="414" />&mdash; an increase of 8 per cent in 1993 and a cumulative increase of 30 per cent over the past five years.</P>
    <P>These excellent results are reflected in the remarkable trade surplus of 1993, estimated at £3.8 billion or 12.3 per cent of GDP.  It is clear from these figures that exporting industry has not only survived but triumped over the turbulent trading conditions of 1993.  The achievements of Irish exporters in 1993 show that we have the capability to win more business in highly competitive markets and despite adverse conditions.</P>
    <P>The focus of An Bord Tráchtála's work is about identifying market opportunities for Irish companies and assisting them in a developmental way to avail of these opportunities.  The market development programme for 1994-1999, which will be administered by An Bord Tráchtála, assisted by EU Structural Funds, aims to increase the exports of indigenous industry and to diversify and sustain the growth of Ireland's world market share.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that this programme will yield an increase of an average of 9 per cent per annum in exports of indigenous industry, from now to the end of the century.  Specific measures include the development of marketing capability within Irish firms, increasing awareness and promotion of Irish products and services through activities both in Ireland and overseas, and developing the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises to introduce new products and services into the marketplace.  These measures seek to close the gap which still exists between some Irish firms and their European counterparts in areas such as marketing skills, information and organisation.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the ESRI medium term review for the period 1994-2000 forecasts average annual inflation to remain under 2.5 per cent.  This factor, combined with growing competitiveness within the Irish economy, should keep Irish firms well positioned to avail of these measures and so keeping indigenous industry on line with the 9 per cent average export growth target.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, in terms of economic <Col N="415" /> impact, £1 of indigenous exports produces the same benefit as almost £2 of multinational exports, because indigenous industry creates more indirect wealth and jobs and keeps more of its profit in Ireland.  The Government, through An Bord Tráchtála, has in place a range of measures to help safeguard and expand these exports and thereby maintain and increase direct employment in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the ability of the indigenous sector to succeed in these markets is an essential element in the future wellbeing of the country's economy.  At a time when job creation is our single biggest priority, the capacity for job creation in this sector must be fully exploited.  As I have already indicated, the growth of indigenous exports has been very encouraging, but it is crucial that we not only maintain but also seek to accelerate the growth rate of recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> states:</P>
    <P>The development of the indigenous sector of industry and services is a key priority because of its close integration into the domestic economy, the location of corporate decision-making and the final destination of profits.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of strategy will be on improving the competitiveness of Irish-owned industry with a view to achieving an increased share of international and domestic markets, thereby providing a platform for sustainable employment growth.</P>
    <P>There is every indication that, over the next decade, we will see a new age of world trade and this is why we must encourage and assist Irish industry to compete now.</P>
    <P>The recent completion of the GATT Uruguay Round will provide a major boost for trade and will act to accelerate economic recovery.  The ESRI suggests that growth in world trade will accelerate to nearly 5.5 per cent this year and by an average of 6 per cent in the medium-term. GATT has created a new confidence <Col N="416" /> and stability in world trade &mdash; the crucial benefit of the agreement is its long term impact, which will undoubtedly build a stronger and more dynamic world trade structure.</P>
    <P>Ireland must also seek to benefit fully from the enormous opportunities inherent in the Single European Market. Over the coming years, our home market, which now means Europe, will open up even greater potential for winning more business.</P>
    <P>One important element of this new business, one which is often ignored, is public procurement.  However, to most people, public procurement is just another Eurospeak term but public procurement is a term with which we should all become familiar.  Any business person worthy of the name will ignore it at his or her cost.  Put simply, what it means is all the purchasing done by public bodies and agencies of all sorts, from the largest Government Department to the smallest hospital.</P>
    <P>In an Irish context alone, it amounts to a very large amount of business, more than £4 billion a year.  However, it is when we translate it into EU terms that its magnitude becomes apparent.  It is estimated that, throughout the Union, spending by central government, state bodies and local authorities and other public sector purchasers amounts to the equivalent of more than £400 billion a year.  Previously, only a small percentage of this business was placed with suppliers from outside the procuring state, although it must be said that the Irish market was open to the tune of about 50 per cent when others were of the order of 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The liberalisation of public procurement policy creates a huge area of potential new business for Irish companies. The time has come for Irish companies to begin to take advantage of new legislative developments.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for contracts which fall outside the new regulatory thresholds and areas such as defence and security which are not covered, the total annual business represented by open public procurement will be at least £350 billion per <Col N="417" /> year.  The sheer size of the market will, of itself, be a major driving force in stimulating the kind of business expansion and competitive thrust which the Single Market seeks to achieve.  It presents tremendous opportunities, not just for large companies and organisations but also for small and medium-sized firms.</P>
    <P>The principal benefits for Irish companies lie in gaining access to public procurement contracts in other European countries which were previously denied to them.  Probably the main domestic benefit is that Irish companies are likely to become more aware of the public sector as a source of potential business. It is vital that we strive to implement fully the new public procurement regulations, both for the overall benefit of intra-Union trade and to assist Irish firms to win their share of this huge market.</P>
    <P>So often, EU laws are derided because of bureaucratic inflexibilities or whatever, but in this instance the benefits are real and very substantial.  This is why it is so important for any firm which is genuinely interested in winning new businesses from Europe's public purchasers to learn about it.  An Bord Tráchtála is there to help them learn.</P>
    <P>All these developments &mdash; whether in a GATT or EU context &mdash; illustrate why the Government must take action now to work towards the longer-term positioning of Irish trade, seeking to increase the diversification of Irish exports and to sustain growth in Ireland's market share throughout Europe.  An increase of 25 per cent in Ireland's share of European markets is our target between now and the end of the millennium.  We will also encourage the participation of Irish companies in growth markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim.</P>
    <P>The underlying principle will be to encourage companies to develop an export market presence relative to their experience, once they have established themselves in the domestic market, and ABT programmes have been structured to provide the support appropriate to each stage of a firm's international marketing development.</P>
    <P>To achieve these objectives, in excess <Col N="418" /> of £200 million will be invested over the next five years, funded from a combination of European Regional Development Fund and Exchequer sources, as well as the significant resources which An Bord Tráchtála itself will generate.</P>
    <P>I now propose an increase of £250 million in the aggregate amount of non-repayable grants which may be paid to An Bord Tráchtála to implement this ambitious programme and I commend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the work of An Bord Tráchtála on behalf of the country and our exporters.  I compliment it on its expertise and level of commitment to ensuring the continuing success of our exports.  It is recognised to be a professional body and statistics show it has been very successful.  We should recognise <Col N="419" /> also the high level of expertise of our exporters and their good efforts.  Our trade performance has been one of the best in the world.  Therefore, we can be justifiably proud of our efforts in the export field.  It is encouraging that our exports continue to perform strongly in 1994 and the indications are that it will be another record year.</P>
      <P>Despite the world recession and the currency crisis, 1993 was a record year in terms of exports, particularly for our indigenous sector.  The rate of growth in 1993 was not as good as 1992 but that was due mainly to the world recession and the currency crisis.  While world trade grew by only 2.6 per cent in 1993 Irish exports grew by more than three times the world average.  To achieve this our companies had to increase significantly their market share despite the increase in competition.  In a recent statement An Bord Tráchtála expressed the hope that there will be a 10 per cent increase in exports from indigenous industries.  This year our total exports are expected to grow to £19.8 billion, an increase of 9 per cent.  The indications are this target will be reached.  There are some concerns regarding our indigenous sector, especially in regard to the present strength of the punt against sterling.  That will pose difficulties for those who export to Britain.</P>
      <P>The GATT agreement will have adverse effects on some sectors of our economy.  The agricultural, food, textile and clothing sectors will face challenges. The estimates on the consequences of the GATT Uruguay round for agriculture indicate that Ireland will feel the impact of the loses before we can expect to experience any gain from increased trade.  The GATT will present great opportunities to our exporters but they will face intense competition from countries with which they did not compete previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of our exports is equivalent to 63 per cent of our GNP which leaves us second only to Belgium in the EU. Proportionately Ireland's dependence on international trade is six times greater <Col N="420" /> than Japan and eight times greater than the USA.  We export two-thirds of our gross manufacturing output and 130,000 manufacturing jobs result from export sales.  Therefore, it is important we maintain our great export performance.  If we want to create more jobs we will have to sell more of our products abroad.  To do that we will have to market more aggressively.  We may not be able to win the markets we had in the past because of increased competition.  We must be vigilant and cannot be complacent. Although we are performing well at present and our trade figures are positive, we will face challenges in the future and we will have to overcome obstacles in an energetic and constructive way.</P>
    <P>Export growth is related to many factors from competitive advantage to markeing drive.  The GATT agreement will present increased opportunities for our exporters to win new business. However, like the Single Market, it will mean challenge and intensified competition. We must compete to boost our sales and market share.  I cannot understand why the budget for the administration of An Bord Tráchtála was reduced this year by 8 per cent from £37.828 million in 1993 to £34,781 million in 1994.  That reduction is regrettable. The successful conclusion of GATT opens up world markets to our exporters but will encourage competition from Third World suppliers to our traditional markets.</P>
    <P>There has been an economic recovery in western Europe and the USA in 1994. In those circumstances the Government should be making extra funds available for market prospecting and development rather than reducing the fund.  Exporters have reported that the lack of funds available to the ITB is causing that body to curtail its international marketing activities. That factor may affect our industrial drive and our export figures towards the end of this year and next year.  Our exporters are experiencing difficulties in the marketplace due to the reduction in funding for marketing initiatives.</P>
    <P>Another indication of this negative policy is the decision to reduce the provision <Col N="421" /> for export credit insurance from £11.4 million in 1993 to £5.97 million in 1994.  This will seriously affect our exports to non-OECD countries.  Some of our exporters are concerned at the credit export insurance and lines of credit made available to their competitors by the UK and other European Governments. This brings me back to a point I made already: the fact that we won markets in Europe and around the world does not mean that we are guaranteed to hold them forever and we must continue our aggressive drive in that area.  Limiting resouces can affect our efforts.  The Minister should remind the Minister for Tourism and Trade, who is out of the country, that any restriction in the amount of money made available for our export drive will not help export performance.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that £1 worth of exports from our indigenous sector is worth £2 from the multinational sector. The level of repatriation of profits by the multinationals is of major concern to all of us but if our very successful performance in exporting could be translated into jobs it would certainly help in tackling the jobs crisis.  However, the money being made here because of the performance of Irish workers and, in some cases, Government incentives, is not being translated into jobs because it is being repatriated to multinational company headquarters in Chicago, other parts of America, Germany, etc. Although we must recognise the contribution of the multinationals to the workforce, we are not benefiting to the extent we should.  The indigenous sector is a proven provider of jobs and we must place more emphasis on it in future.  The decrease in funding for An Bord Tráchtála will have a greater effect on the indigenous sector than on the multinationals because, of its nature, it is composed of small operators who got small grants, perhaps £5,000, to market their products and these grants are no longer available because of the decrease in funding. If we are committed to helping the indigenous sector we will have to subsidise their visits abroad to market their products and seek niches in the European <Col N="422" /> market and this financial restriction will inhibit that sector in expanding and seeking more markets.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter yesterday in the Dáil to which I would like the Minister to rsepond in greater detail than he did yesterday. As we are discussing trade, it is right that I should again bring up the matter.  An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> today dealt with our export performance and the strength of the IR£.  In March of this year the IR£ stood at 95p sterling, its value rose to over 98p today, having topped almost 99p two days ago.  This 4 per cent increase is seriously affecting our exports to the UK and Northern Ireland.  It is also aversely affecting the competitiveness of Irish exporters against UK suppliers in third markets, by which I mean European, American and other world markets.  Last Monday the Irish Dairy Board stated that the IR£ had now risen to an unrealistic level and was causing it to switch product from the commercial market to intervention sales. That is serious.  It is because we abandoned commercial markets and resorted to intervention that we did not in the past gain market niches and space on the supermarket shelves in Europe.  I hope selling into intervention will not again become the trend because of the strength of the IR£.</P>
    <P>Thirty per cent of our total exports go to the UK and Northern Ireland.  Fifty per cent of the exports of the labour intensive indigenous manufacturing sector also go to those markets and the indigenous sector will be most threatened, it is vulnerable because of the strength of the IR£.  Any loss of market share in this sector will have an immediate impact on jobs.  A survey carried out in the last few days among exporters showed that a 99p pound will result in a drop in sales averaging 7.68 per cent while employment in those companies could drop by as much as 7 per cent.  That is something about which the Government should be concerned.  As pointed out in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, the value of our currency is a major element in our international competitiveness and it is worth mentioning that the negative effect <Col N="423" /> of a strong IR£1 is compounded by the tax-PRSI wedge.  Companies maintaining operations in Ireland and the UK report that the Irish operation is becoming uncompetitive mainly because of our tax and PRSI rates.  We have to be competitive in many areas but particularly in the area of tax and PRSI rates.  Pretty Polly in Killarney experienced considerable difficulties recently with the result that staff had to go on short-time working.  The social cost to the parent company of employing people in England is £20 less than here.  Straight away we are less competitive.  If we are to be competitive and give our exporters a greater chance we must tackle the issue of the tax-PRSI wedge.  Our exporters need every encouragement and if they are hamstrung by the very unfair and punitive tax regime here they are struggling against even greater odds in taking on their competitors in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill to which Fine Gael certainly has no opposition.  It is refreshing to see that our balance of trade is so healthy.  However, to continue this good performance we must finance An Bord Tráchtála properly.  It has responded by its very fine performance.  On many occasions public servants criticise these bodies, but An Bord Tráchtála has had a very fine track record in recent years.  It received good encouragement from the Minister, unlike another State agency. It is unfortunate that State employees should be demoralised, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to encourage Irish exporters to improve their performance.  We must assist them in every way, not alone by providing incentives to market their produce but also by introducing a regime that will not penalise them and that will provide a better environment for the production of goods.  We must address the problem of the tax-PRSI wedge so as to improve the environment for employment creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome the Bill.  it is a significant step in the right direction.  I <Col N="424" /> wish to pay tribute to An Bord Tráchtála and its predecessor, Córas Tráchtála, for the sterling work carried out down the years in promoting and finding good markets for Irish produce abroad and in underpinning Ireland's export drive, as it did with cost efficiency and effectiveness. That body deserves to be highly praised. It is a cause of optimism that it has a degree of sophistication and skill not always evident in their opposite numbers in other countries.</P>
      <P>It is important that such a marketing body be adequately and properly resourced, and that is the reason for this Bill.  We are a small island nation with a tiny home consumption market and in order to survive we must trade with other countries.  If we are to find jobs for our people and provide the standard of living demanded and expected by them we must maintain and intensify our exports levels. We must not be niggardly and mean-minded but must provide adequate budgets for An Bord Tráchtála to carry out its work efficiently.  If we do not do so, there will be job losses and a failure to create new jobs, which would cost us dearly at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>We are entering very challenging and testing times in our export trade, but there are certain things we can predict with certainty.  For example, traditional markets are being flooded with goods that are cheaply produced in other parts of the world, particularly south-east Asia.  That is a reality we cannot afford to ignore.  It is important that we not alone market aggressively and intelligently but also give great attention to research and product development so that the product we offer can compete on the shelves not only of Europe but of the Third World.  It is important that we do not seek to cut down on the expertise necessary in research and product development.  We must underpin the marketing drive of which we all warmly approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that has not been made is that we must not ignore the realities of the home market.  The recent report on small businesses launched by the Government identified the expansion of market opportunities <Col N="425" /> on the home market as a critical priority for small business.  Despite this, however, an important marketing development programme for Irish companies has been discontinued by the trade board, An Bord Tráchtála, due to lack of funds.  Given that the task force report states that Irish companies have been losing their share of the domestic market &mdash; import penetration increased from 35 per cent in 1980 to 47.5 per cent in 1990 &mdash; it is amazing that a marketing development programme precisely geared to help companies win more sales in the Irish market through greater marketing professionalism is suspended.</P>
    <P>Anyone who buys toys at Christmas-time, a peak time for consumer spending, will be aware of the number, volume and value of foreign made toys that flood the Irish market.  This is an indication of the size of the import market and of the scope and potential for developing and marketing Irish products.  It is a major blow to Irish companies not to have the resources to employ full-time marketing personnel.</P>
    <P>One of the measures recommended by the task force on small business has been axed.  How can the Minister defend that decision?  The marketing consultancy programme enabled small firms to obtain the part-time services of an experienced consultant to draw up a marketing programme for the home market.  The programme has been suspended by the trade board following a cut this year in grant in aid from £38 million to £35 million.  I hope that can be redressed by this Bill. Under the axed programme small companies could avail of a marketing consultant for at least 32 days per year.  For this service the trade board gave a grant of £9,000.  The programme was based on achieving measurable results in terms of marketing development.  By any standards, it was a good programme.</P>
    <P>In the last five years about 400 small firms availed of the programme and the consensus in business is that it had been very beneficial in helping these companies develop marketing expertise and increase sales on the home market.  While the trade board has axed the consultancy <Col N="426" /> programme, it has retained a marketing graduate placement scheme under which small companies can avail of the services of a graduate on a full-time basis for one year.  That scheme is also subsidised by the trade board.  Many people in business believe that this trade-off between the two programmes is misguided.  Understandably, marketing graduates are inexperienced whereas the consultants to whom they had previous access are experienced in marketing and a proven track record in boosting sales for their clients' firms.  Those two schemes should not be mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme that helps to place graduates in that manner by giving them one year's experience but the high level of emigration among our graduates is a great loss.  Young people who have acquired a high standard of education, skill and expertise are forced to emigrate and work for competitive countries abroad.  If action is not taken to stop that haemorrhage, it will exacerbate our difficulties in competing successfully in an open market and a competitive world.</P>
    <P>The marketing graduate placement scheme is not an adequate replacement for the existing programme.  In the light of this new estimate, the Minister should discuss with An Bord Tráchtála the possibility of reintroducing a marketing consultancy programme.  Proposals have been brought forward to set up a special division within the Department to assist small business.  There is great potential in that area for the creation of badly needed jobs but if we do that on the one hand, we must be consistent and not give the impression that we are making advances in the area while tolerating cutbacks in a service that has proven its worth to small businesses.  I ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to consider the reintroduction of this successful programme.</P>
    <P>I wanted to raise a number of other matters but the Minister asked us to keep our contributions brief to conclude the Bill tonight, with which I agree.  There were references by previous speakers to the potential of indigenous industries and the need to assit them.  It is important <Col N="427" /> that they are given the same level of grant-aid offered to foreign companies in the past.  That matter should be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Deenihan.  Unless we examine the way we tax employment we cannot hope to continue to trade on an equal footing with our competitors.  We have penal levels of taxation on employment here and while there were changes in the employers' PRSI in the last budget, they were merely at one level, cancelled out by increases on PRSI levels at the other end of the scale.  That is tinkering with a system fundamental to our economy and job creation.  Unless there is radical, across-the-board tax reform as well as reform of employers' PRSI, it will become increasingly difficult for Ireland to trade and the task we set An Bord Tráchtála will be made more difficult.</P>
    <P>There are areas over which we have no discretion but others, such as the cost of energy and transport, make our exports less competitive.  The Minister would be well advised to discuss the state of our county roads with the Minister for the Environment.  I realise it is almost imperative for a politician to refer to the condition of our county roads but companies based at a distance from our air and seaports find it extremely difficult to get their products to the markets on time.  Much of that difficulty is due directly to the scandalous condition of our county roads.  The Minister should convince his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, of the need to tackle this problem.  In addition to all the other arguments &mdash; equally valid &mdash; we must appreciate the problems experienced by our exporters who must contend with this additional problem while trying to compete with markets abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Quill for their contributions. There is no conflict between us in relation to the Bill but a number of interesting points were raised during the <Col N="428" /> course of the debate to which I wish to refer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill referred to the problem in regard to transport.  Obviously, the fact that we are an island nation is a great disadvantage.  There is provision in the plan submitted to Brussels to address the problems in that area.  Deputy Quill referred specifically to county roads. There is a provision over the term of the plan for the upgrading of roads of strategic importance and I hope that is an adequate response to the Deputy's point.  Road and rail structures, as well as air and sea transport facilities, must be improved in terms of competitiveness because that will be reflected in the price of goods when they are marketed.  In regard to the Deputy's point concerning the marketing consultancy programme and the present marketing graduate programme, I will ask the Minister for Tourism and Trade to raise that matter with An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan raised some interesting points.  He referred to the reduction in the annual allocation to An Bord Tráchtála but that reduction must be seen in the light of the exceptionally large grant of £37.828 million in 1993 which was made at a time of difficult trading conditions internationally and currency realignments.  Those funds enabled the board to intensify its efforts, and those of Irish firms, in targeting prosperous high growth regions with growth potential for Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>Because of the sluggishness of our main markets it was not a question of holding market share, rather we had to displace competitors in order to make progress.  That area, which is outside the sterling area, is where there was the greatest concentration.  The 1994 allocation represents the second highest to An Bord Tráchtála.  Their grant and incentive schemes were streamlined and rationalised last year.  This will greatly assist towards the more efficient use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even with the reduced grant in aid in 1994 the Minister for Trade and Tourism remains confident they will manage the available resources effectively with no <Col N="429" /> harmful reduction in support to companies. I am aware there will be scope in 1994 for a modest increase in receipts to ABT which should help alleviate the position to some degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan stressed how ABT programmes could have an effective impact on employment and exports. Export sales must be fought for and won each year in order to maintain existing jobs.  Growth in exports from indigenous companies is essential for job creation. They are almost twice as labour intensive as multinationals.  Deputies Quill and Deenihan alluded to this point at some length.</P>
    <P>Irish companies increased their market share in key EU markets despite the recession.  As these markets recover the outlook is positive for growth in export sales and, therefore, jobs.  As set out in the National Development Plan the targets for indigenous industry are an increase in indigenous exports from £3.7 billion in 1992 to £6.8 billion in 1999, a doubling of the number of indigenous manufacturing firms with a turnover in Ireland in excess of £100 million from 16 in 1989 to 32 in 1999, and the creation of 11,000 gross jobs per annum.  In the case of the multinational sector, the target is to create 9,000 gross jobs per annum on average through inward investment and by the expansion and development of foreign-owned companies already located in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan implied that small scale exporters are denied access to grants to enable them visit markets and this I reject.  It is not so.  The ceiling on the level of such grants was doubled.  He also alluded to the exchange rate which is a matter for the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank.  Obviously the Minister for Tourism and Trade would be concerned about developments which would make our exports less competitive.  That is why following the 1992-93 currency crisis he exhorted firms to take steps to improve their treasury management capability and placed particular emphasis on the need to explore the possibility of collective action by small to medium <Col N="430" /> sized enterprises on a sectoral or geographical basis.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies praised the professionalism of ABT and I echo that. There was a degree of scepticism about our export boom and certain commentators claim it is all down to the multinationals. That is not so.  While they make a vital contribution to the economy and account for three quarters of our industrial exports, the indigenous sector on which ABT focuses its efforts has outstripped overall export performance. Deputy Quill suggested ABT is inactive on the home market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  I heard this suggestion from other quarters and it seems to be based on the merger of the Irish Goods Council with An Córas Tráchtála in 1991.  It is suggested that the home market focus of the Irish Goods Council was lost as a consequence of this merger.  In fact, ABT is extremely active on the home markets and its developmental work is intrinsically related to their promotional activity.  The first is a platform for the second.  That was one of the reasons for the merger.</P>
      <P>During his contribution on the previous Bill Deputy Deenihan spoke about the small indigenous food companies that may be producing a product and servicing a small local market making a quantum leap into the export market.  It is a difficult step, particularly in the food area where there are high setting up costs.  The Government and State agencies realise how important it is to nurture emerging companies and ensure they get their share of the home market.  With the assistance of State agencies they are brought to the stage where they can win substantial markets abroad and achieve high levels of exports, with consequential high levels of employment.</P>

    <P>&mdash;the increasing number of armed robberies <Col N="432" /> and other crimes in urban and rural areas;</P>
    <P>&mdash;concerns repeatedly expressed by the Gardaí regarding crimes committed by persons on bail;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the `revolving door' system that passes for a penal system;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the ready availability of drugs, particularly in our inner cities but now manifesting itself in towns throughout the country and in prisons;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the fears expressed by small shopkeepers who are living in a state of virtual seige, particularly in the greater Dublin area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the failure to effect a reform of the court system; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the increasing incidence of violent crime, especially against vulnerable members of the community,</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to restore law and order so that law-abiding citizens can go about their lives without the fear of attack from criminals who are increasingly immune from punishment or even the pretence of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the measures taken by the Government to improve the effectiveness of the criminal system and</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes, in particular, the details of the £66 million crime fighting package agreed by the Government which includes measures aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána and the provision of two new prisons;</P>
    <P>&mdash;welcomes the Government's unprecedented achievements in the rate of criminal law reform, especially in the areas of the rights of victims, public order and the confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers and other serious criminals;</P>
    <P>&mdash;looks forward to the introduction of further legislative proposals in areas such as juvenile justice, the law on <Col N="433" /> fraud and changes in court procedures to reduce the amount of time which gardaí have to spend in court;</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledges the commitment of the Government to act with all possible speed on the forthcoming Law Reform Commission Report on bail;</P>
    <P>&mdash;endorses the measures taken to ensure clear strategies for agencies involved in the operation of the criminal justice system, including the impending publication for the first time of a comprehensive prison policy document and plan; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;recognises the Government's commitment to continue to take whatever steps are open to it to ensure the protection of the community.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The events of yesterday and today have shown just how apt this motion is and the extent to which Deputy Gay Mitchell and Fine Gael were on the ball in putting it down.  The escalation of the crime problem is a direct side effect of a soft liberal approach.  Until such time as we realise that all that is liberal is not necessarily good we cannot hope to solve some of the modern problems which are now menacing society.  Crime is a case in point.  There is no liberal solution to the law and order problem.  A policy of softly-softly will not catch the criminal.  Criminals are exploiting the well meaning but fuddy-duddy attitude now prevalent in the ruling classes.  This attitude is best articulated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who is explicitly a friend of artists and artistes but implicitly and unintentionally I am sure the friend of the wayward and wicked.  The relaxation of section 31&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It should not be forgotten that ordinary crime in the South, if I may use that expression, has escalated during the past 25 years and the Northern troubles have played a huge part in this. <Col N="436" /> The IRA set the crime agenda by being the originators of bank robberies, car hijacking, kneecapping, murder and protection rackets.  This is the same IRA which has been appeased by the Government with nauseous intensity during the past six to nine months.  Not long afterwards copycat crimes were being committed in the streets of Dublin by non-subversive criminals, and they have continued since.  Appeasement does not work and the Government will eventually learn that lesson.</P>
      <P>Yet there is some hope.  I am glad the Minister for Justice is in the House to hear these nice words about her.  She is a thoroughly modern woman, liberated and liberal but at the same time a rock of good sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether she will be the leader of Fianna Fáil depends largely on her success or failure at turning the tide of crime as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>As she says herself, there is no easy or simple solution to the crime problem. Yet we must get across to her that it is not inevitable that crime must get worse. She must start a process of turning the tide.  This process must include both a carrot and stick and above all else must mobilise public attitudes in the direction of supporting law and order.  The keystone of law and order must be what I call the three Fs policy &mdash; firm, fair and effective.  Several practical measures could be taken speedily to improve this problem.  I wish to put forward the following ten suggestions which I believe would be of great practical help and, if there was a will, could be implemented speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the gardaí in Dublin must be relieved of all traffic duties and the task of serving summonses.  Second &mdash; this was debated on the Adjournment last week &mdash; a 300-man traffic police force should be established in Dublin.  It is shocking that only 23 per cent of all cases in Dublin are successfully prosecuted and fines collected.  This means there is failure rate of 77 per cent.  Traffic police would not only relieve gardaí to fight crime on the streets of Dublin but would also greatly ease traffic congestion and improve the economic environment of the city.  Third, the Crime Committee of Dublin Corporation, on my proposal, has proposed to the Minister &mdash; we have not yet had her response &mdash; that a Dublin metropolitan area Garda reserve of approximately 2,000 people should be established under the social employment scheme to relieve the Garda of certain functions and assist them in others.  The type of function I have in mind appropriate to such a Garda reserve includes the serving of summons, servicing and developing the neighbourhood watch scheme, marshalling major sporting and <Col N="438" /> other events, manning Garda communications and the collection of fines.</P>
    <P>My fourth proposal is that the Government should hold a referendum on bail laws to restore to the courts the discretion they had before the Supreme Court decided otherwise.  Fifth, we should change the prison early release system so that a third time offender will serve his or her full sentence without remission. Sixth, I propose the discontinuance of jailing the poor for the non-payment of fines and introducing an easy payments system so that prison places could be vacated for real criminals.  Seventh, we should reorganise the gardaí located in a small number of garda stations around the city into a large number of kiosk-type sub-stations located in troubled communities. My eighth proposal is that we require each local authority to establish a crime prevention fund for the purpose of building walls, railings or other diversions at focal points of vandalism and crime.  My ninth proposal is that we should introduce legislation, similar to that pertaining to school attendance, whose provisions would hold parents responsible for the misdemeanours of their children.  My tenth and last proposal is that much of the money spent on useless projects should be diverted to create attractive, affordable leisure facilities for young people in this city.  In this respect we could look to Belfast to ascertain what they have done in relation to leisure centres.</P>
    <P>Nobody is proposing a Singapore solution although it demonstrates that the effective application of laws can deter criminals.  The soft option adopted by Governments for too long is causing deaths and many thousands of people in this country to live miserable, frightened lives.</P>

      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have a number of reservations in relation to the contents of Deputy Gay Mitchell's motion, I acknowledge that the nature and extent of crime constitutes one of the major headaches confronting modern society. Very few people, certainly not the innocent victims of crime, would disagree with such a view.  In addition, it must be accepted that a sinister level of violence has become more commonplace over the past decade or so.  Therefore, there is no room for complacency when considering the challenge crime poses to our legislative process.  However, no cause is served by alarmist statements which merely create a sense of panic or hopelessness. Such contributions have a twofold, negative effect.  First, the many excellent people at every level in our law enforcement services can only be discouraged to see their commitment and hard work minimised.  Second, unqualified declarations of doom and gloom, to a certain extent, may be a source of encouragement to those either actively involved in crime or considering carrying out illegal acts.  There is a solemn responsibility on every Member to speak with great care and prudence when discussing the undouted difficulty of dealing comprehensively and effectively with crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I regret the clear implication of Deputy Gay Mitchell's call for the restoration of law and order, but since there is a certain degree of validity in some of the points made by him, it is positive and helpful that we should avail of every opportunity to identify possible improvements in the way we organise our legal system.  In this respect I stress the core importance of audit.  It is vital that our legislation is developed to protect each law-abiding member of our society to the greatest possible extent.  In this respect the continuing excellent work of the Minister and her team must be fully acknowledged.  Indeed it can be said without hesitation that the contribution of the Minister and her Minister of State to developments in the overall area of justice are evident.  That is not merely my opinion; for example, one can ask the <Col N="440" /> Garda, read the <i>Garda Review</i> or other publications where one will find a clear recognition of the work undertaken by the Minister in introducing legislation in this House which will be well known to Deputy Mitchell who is a member of the Select Committee on Security and Legislation of which I am Chairman.  The Deputy will also be aware of the Minister's commitment and her forthright attitude demonstrated at these meetings, her genuine concern to ensure that all aspects of legislation &mdash; a public order Bill, one dealing with drugs or whatever &mdash; and proposal put forward are fully considered. Therefore, I am glad to pay tribute to the Minister, her Minister of State and the Government on the high priority they have afforded this overall area of law and order.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there is credibility in regard to our laws.  That can be done only through their vigorous, effective and fair enforcement within each and every community nationwide.  There can be no acceptance of anything but the highest possible standards in their implementation.  The Garda must operate, and be seen to operate, to the highest professional standards in terms of crime detection and in fair and humane enforcement of the laws.</P>
    <P>In general we have every reason to be proud of our police force and recent statistics issued by bodies such as the Garda Complaints Board support that belief.  At the same time there is no room for complacency.  From time to time one sees strong cases thrown out of court because of technical hitches in the preparation of the prosecution's brief, which is a scandal.  Responsibility does not always revert to legislators; there is a responsibility on the part of the legal profession to administer the law ensuring that fair play and justice is seen to be done, which frequently is not the case. In such cases, when a criminal walks free, the original pain and damage to the innocent party is exacerbated, when a deep sense of injustice can develop.  Similarly, our courts must ensure that all cases are handled professionally.  The enormous trust we place in our legal system must be <Col N="441" /> matched by commensurate responsibility which, in turn, must ensure fair play to each and every member of society.  I emphasise it is unacceptable that any criminal should remain unpunished while the available evidence is not fully produced or deployed within the courtroom.</P>
    <P>Since the development and enactment of laws is a core responsibility of the Oireachtas every consideration should be given in this House to criticisms of our current system.  Similarly, any proposals for change must be encouraged and fully and fairly assessed.  Equally, the structures by which our laws are enforced must be the subject of open and healthy debate.</P>
    <P>However, responsibility for law and order is not the sole preserve of this House, the Garda and our courts, each and every member of society must play a part.  Parents must ensure that their children grow up with a healthy respect for the law and the rights of others in society but frequently that is not the case. People approach public representatives complaining that the position was not like that ten or 20 years ago but, unfortunately, such people must be told we are not living in the past.  That is why I welcome the £66 million package the Minister brought forward to cater for further recruits to the Garda Síochána, providing additional resources and taking gardaí out of offices.  Too much expertise is wasted sitting behind desks but that is being tackled.  Equally in relation to offenders, I welcome the extension of the probation service, positive action urgently required and which will be continuous. It is a tribute to the commitment of the Minister, the Government and the resources they have made available.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Gay Mitchell will not press this motion.  We are all in the midst of electioneering and indeed we have seen people play to the Gallery a couple of times today.  This issue is too serious for that.  We are all committed to doing our best to provide the security people need.  We should support the Minister in her efforts and this motion should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell questioned liberalism and the rôle of Labour Ministers.  That sounds vaguely familiar.  Ireland is a safe place in which to live.  The cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick are safe places in which to live relative to cities in other countries.  There is a serious and genuine concern in our communities regarding recent events. There is anguish and fear.  There have been five murders during the past three weeks and the Grace Livingstone murder has been in the news again.  There has been an increase in violent crime generally and this has dismayed many people.  The murders to which I referred involved the brutal and savage killing of people, a child, a priest and a pregnant woman.  These murders were grotesque, callous, incomprehensible and defied logic.  Why did these murders happen in Ireland?  Would more gardaí, Garda stations, better court resources and more social workers have helped?  I do not think so.  There has been an increase in the number of serial killings in the United Kingdom and the United States.  The Minister should carry out research into the character of these people and the reason they get involved in such brutal murders.  Has such research commenced? We have to ensure that this society does not produce killers in the way other societies are producing them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right when she says that rising crime is a worldwide phenomenon and is a feature of the modern world. What is happening to modern society? The Minister was correct in stating last night that there has been a decline in moral guidance and in the authority of the family, the schools and the churches. I have sympathey for the Minister when she asks if the criminal justice system can cope with these changes and adapt to the serious situation which has developed.  I suggest we need a back to basics approach to crime and we need to look at the fundamentals.  Obviously, the most important areas are personal safety and security and the protection of property, such as houses, cards, handbags and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us give the do gooders a wide berth <Col N="443" /> and get our priorities right.  Let us leave the liberal agenda aside for the moment. People have a legitimate expectation that wrong doers will be punished and that prisoners will serve their sentences.  We need tough laws, adequate Garda and court resources and effective custodial and non-custodial disposals.  I welcome the Minister's response in regard to an increased role for parishes and community activities.  She has recognised the need for a new approach and introduced special measures for Ronanstown and Killinarden to deal with the problem crime.  That community based proposal will bear fruit.  Support for the neighbourhood watch scheme in the city is important.  That gives back to the community and the parish a sense of responsibility which I support.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1993, particularly the sections which deal with law and order. The Minister has her critics when she introduced that legislation but she will be proved right regarding certain powers given to gardaí.  I am not saying I welcome the Act in its totality but the sections dealing with law and order and the dispersal of crowds and so on.  A juvenile justice Bill has been promised. In it the Minister will propose a community based strategy to tackle crime. That is getting back to basics and back to the community approach.  In that Bill the Minister proposes to establish a rôle for parents who will be asked to face up to their responsibilities for their children. This too is getting back to basics.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the role of the media and crime.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 22 May 1994 a journalist suggested that the media in general has a vested interest in crime in that once in a while they decide to highlight the issue to boost circulation.  I am sometimes amused to discover that the problem of joyriders in my constituency is not reported in the newspapers when a few months later the media will tell us there is an epidemic of joyriding.  Three weeks later the media will drop the issue and move on to another.  That is not helpful. <Col N="444" /> There are other vested interests in crime such as the gardaí, who may request more overtime, insurance companies, security companies and the newspapers.  We need to put matters in perspective and to be streetwise about crime.  Occasionally the media pursues a different agenda in highlighting the facts.  The media has an important role to play in a democracy but the problem can be best highlighted by public representatives and community groups.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of gardaí on the beat throughout the city.  Everybody agrees it is a good idea to have gardaí on the beat.  I suspect that the Garda and, perhaps, the Minister may regard that as a quaint old fashioned method and that the Garda have more important functions to perform such as solving murders and so on.  It is not a quaint old fashioned idea.  The public want a visible Garda presence and they want gardaí back on foot patrols.  There is an even greater role for Garda foot patrols in the prevention of crime and we should examine that issue.  The public believe that is necessary and I want to ensure that is Government policy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's crime package announced in December 1993.  When that package is fully implemented we will see an improvement in the position.  This package involves the recruitment of more gardaí and of 200 civilian clerical and administrative staff.  This will release uniformed gardaí for other duties including foot patrols.  We must continue to review the position and adopt a back to basics approach.  Crime is a serious issue and must be dealt with.  I welcome some of the new approaches which involve a back to basics approach and back to community, parish and parental responsibility.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Earlier Deputy Jim Mitchell exhorted the Minister to bring in a traffic corps in Dublin. That reminded me of when as a young Deputy I put a proposal to the Minister's predecessor to establish a traffic corps <Col N="445" /> throughout the country.  That detailed proposal was drawn up with the aid of a number of people from my constituency. It was felt that such a corps would be self-financing.  I ask the Minister and her officials to note the remarks made by Deputy Mitchell and me and to remove the dust from some of the old files in the Department.</P>
      <P>On the news earlier Deputy Bruton made great play of the fact that the Minister was absent from the Chamber this morning when he sought answers to a number of questions.  The Minister was in my constituency at the time to carry out an important function, to turn the sod on the site of the new Garda station in my home town.  Gardaí have been looking for this for some time because they are working in Dickensian conditions in a town with a population of 30,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister is doing what she said she would, that is, providing the Garda with more resources to fight crime.  She is also aware that the divisional headquarters in Dundalk requires to be extended and she is pressing for this.  The Minister had a meeting with Deputy Bell and me to discuss the position at Drogheda courthouse in which she has an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was present in the House yesterday when the Minister responded to questions. I listened to the debate last night and again tonight and like other speakers I believe it is wrong for Members to try to make political capital out of current events.  If we create anxiety unnecessarily among the public this will result in a lack of confidence in the security forces, particularly the Garda.  There is an insidious campaign, not necessarily being directed by anyone in this House, whereby people are saying that the Garda does not want to know, is not interested or is not up to the job.  As Deputy Haughey mentioned, members of society have a responsibility to assist the Garda <Col N="446" /> and the security forces.  There is also a need for parental control.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned previously in the House that when Jamie Bulger was killed in tragic circumstances in Liverpool the question was asked in British society why this happened and why had it sunk to such a level.  This led to the back to basics campaign for which Mr. Major was derided.  What he was trying to say&mdash;he was not allowed to do so &mdash; was that society should consider how it should dictate its rules and mores.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to create anxiety unnecessarily among the public.  I live only two miles from the Border and in many areas in Northern Ireland there is no confidence in the security forces.  This is one of the reasons, despite the ring of steel, they are not in a position to police it properly.  If we ever reach that position, God help us.  As long as the people have confidence in the security forces, the Garda Síochána in particular will be able to operate properly.  All public representatives have to be responsible in what they say and to be aware that any injudicious remarks, perhaps for a headline, may lead to uncertainty and a feeling of uneasiness among the general public.</P>
    <P>I understand from some of my constituents that already there are checkpoints along the Border.  This is to be welcomed as the people want the Garda to maintain a presence.  People living in the Border region often feel they do not have enough gardaí but when one examines the figures one finds that they have a sizeable number in comparison with other areas.  This is due to the problems on the island.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to give the Garda the tools it requires.  Individual gardaí will often tell us that their hands are tied and they do not have enough power.  I would not like to see a return of the heavy gang &mdash; some of the Members on the other side of the House who are castigating us on this side might know more about that matter than I would &mdash; but we should provide the Garda with the proper tools.  The judicial system is often castigated without justification but it should be borne in mind that 99 per <Col N="447" /> cent of cases are prosecuted successfully with the aid of the Garda and the Judiciary.  If there is any Department which is more prolific in introducing legislation than the Department of Justice I would like to know it.  This Department is responsible for most of the Bills due to be taken in the House.  That is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, contains provisions which restrict the right to silence.  This matter needs to be considered further in an effort to give the Garda more powers.  The only way the Garda will be able to prosecute a person is if that person makes a statement or if it catches them in the act.  This does not always happen.  We have to find some way of putting the onus on the accused &mdash; I am not talking about draconian measures &mdash; to assist the Garda by restricting the right to silence.  This may lead to an accused or defendant admitting involvement in an incident.</P>
    <P>The Minister is reviewing the question of the right of bail.  The sooner this is completed the better.  A referendum should be held to see if the people want the right to bail restricted.  We would soon find out if crime is considered a major issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to community policing.  She mentioned Killinarden and other parts of Dublin in this regard.  There is a local authority estate in my home town which consists of 750 houses and has few facilities.  It also has a young population.  Because of the problems being experienced a garda was assigned to this estate at his own request. Deputies may not be aware that if there are problems along the Border &mdash; problems have been experienced in Crossmaglen recently &mdash; many gardaí are reassigned to Border duties.</P>
    <P>In this instance the garda was assigned to Border duty by mistake and for a number of days the estate in question did not have a garda on the beat.  A number of people made representations to me and the garda was put back on duty in that estate.  People from the community told me there was an appreciable increase <Col N="448" /> in petty crime in the estate while the garda was absent and that they are delighted he is back on duty.  That is a classic example of the need for the garda on the beat.  The people of that estate do not want gardaí driving in and out again in a squad car.  The way forward in combating crime, particularly in large urban areas, is to have gardaí on the beat.  I thank the Minister and the chief superintendent for doing this in my area.  I could not contribute to a debate on crime without putting that on record.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, the Department of Justice and the Garda.  Even if I were in Opposition I would support the Garda for its efforts.  I am sure members of the Opposition will say they did not castigate the Garda, but it is important that we are realistic and conscious of the words we use and the way in which they may impinge on people's confidence in the Garda.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate on this topic.  Following the spate of issues in the past couple of weeks which have raised crime to the top of the agenda, it is appropriate that the House should address the crime problem and I compliment Deputy Mitchell for tabling the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was born and grew up in the village of Caltra in County Galway and share the abhorrence of many Members of this House at the appalling murder of a woman from that village last week.  I also share the sorrow and sympathy of Members for her family and the families of Imelda Riney and Fr. Joe Walsh who was murdered near Eyrcourt.  In those parts of the country and elsewhere people have been overcome by a great sense of fear as a result of these murders and feel very vulnerable mainly because of the policy of denuding rural areas of their Garda stations.  That, together with the terrorist attack in Dublin at the weekend, <Col N="449" /> the continuing crime problem &mdash; in particular that associated with drugs &mdash; the differences within the Garda both in its representatives association and in relation to the conduct of certain inquiries and the reports of the Minister's relationship with the Garda Commissioner, have given rise to a great deal of public unease.  This unease is felt not only about the rising crime problem, but about the ability and strength of the Garda to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Ahern's final remarks, to my knowledge there is not any Member of this House who does not support the Garda in its efforts to curb crime.  Public confidence in the Force needs to be restored rapidly.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that a debate on this issue should have to take place in this formal style.  Following the murders in Galway I wrote to the chairperson of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security asking him to convene a meeting at which members of that committee could discuss ways of addressing the problem with the Garda Commissioner and others.  I received a reply from him today stating that while he sympathised with what I was trying to do, he could not convene a special meeting of the committee because its terms of reference did not allow him.  The terms of reference of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security only allow it to debate the Committee Stages of Bills and to examine legislation, reports or matters referred to it directly by the House.  That needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>The former committee on crime was at least able to talk directly to the people involved in crime prevention and detection and produce reports on what should be done to address the problem.  That type of forum is necessary to get the views of the various agencies involved in the fight against crime, such as the Department of Justice, the Garda and the probation and welfare service, whose officers published a report earlier this week.  The Governnor of Mountjoy Prison made a number of comments on the crime problem, many of which are much more enlightened than those we hear in this <Col N="450" /> House and they should be teased out more fully.  The terms of reference of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security should be broadened to enable it carry out that work or a specific reference should be made by this House to that committee to give it the task of addressing the crime problem in its wider context.</P>
    <P>Invariably when we discuss the question of crime old chestnuts crop up. Invariably the role of the Garda and the necessity for more gardaí are raised.  It is obvious that the Garda is under strength and this is certainly true in the greater Dublin area.  While half the crime rate relates to the Dublin metropolitan area, the ratio of gardaí to population in the greater Dublin area is only half that in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The need for the garda on the beat crops up again and again and, in general, I agree with that.  The idea of concentrating gardaí in large stations has much to recommend it in terms of economies of scale for facilities and so on, but as far as visibility of gardaí on the ground and contact between them and the community is concerned, it is not worthwhile.  This is not only the case in rural Ireland.  I suspect that many of the difficulties that arose between the Garda and the community in the south Galway and Clare area during the investigations of the past few weeks resulted from a concentration of gardaí in large stations.</P>
    <P>There is a sense that the Garda are remote from the community, they are seen on motorbikes and in police cars but rarely seen in contact with people.  In my constituency people who reported a crime claimed that to be the case.  While the efforts to provide a system of community policing have been worthwhile and the gardaí are committed to it, it is not working because the areas many community gardaí must cover are too wide.  It is absurd that a community garda in part of my constituency has to cover an area with a population of 20,000 and it does not reinforce the idea of community policing.  The closure of rural Garda stations should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>While 40 per cent of the crime is committed <Col N="451" /> by juveniles less than 1 per cent of the Garda police force operate in the juvenile liaison area even though figures show that a high percentage of offenders who are counselled and helped by the juvenile liaison officers do not commit further offences.  The juvenile liaison service has a high success record in dealing with offenders and it is amazing that, despite that, more officers have not been appointed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal to appoint traffic police as it does not make sense for a garda to stand on the road shining a torch at a motorist's tax disc when there is serious policing and detection work to be done.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish a reserve police force might usefully be considered whereby people would not require the level of training necessary for the Garda, a lower level of police work could be carried out by such a force.</P>
    <P>It would be a great mistake to take the view that the solution to crime is to recruit more police or to make extra prison places available.  The bulk of the Minister's package of more than £60 million is devoted to providing additional prison places and gardaí.  Approximately £25 million of the package is intended to provide in excess of 200 additional prison places at an average cost of £120,000 per place.  That allocation contrasts sharply with the provision of £100,000 for community based initiatives to combat crime. The Minister's package will allocate more to provide an additional prison place than to providing additional resources for community initiatives aimed at tackling crime.  If we are serious about tackling crime it is not sufficient to take the view that criminals can be locked up and forgotten. Tackling the problem will not be as simple as that.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that crime can be explained because of social circumstances or that somebody is less of a criminal because they come from a poor background or are unemployed.  Unfortunately, at times liberal opinion has tended to concentrate more on the problems of the offender rather than on those <Col N="452" /> of the victim.  We cannot seriously address the problem of crime unless we address its causes and the type of society in which we live.</P>
    <P>There has not been a serious debate about crime.  Deputy Mitchell tabled a motion about crime statistics but we do not have the basic information, research, or people engaging in academic studies to facilitate serious examination and analysis of the problem.  We do not have enough information about the cause and effect of crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern referred to John Major's &ldquo;back to basics&rdquo; campaign. The problem about John Major is that he leads a party which, under its previous leader, subscribed to the view that there was no such thing as society, only individuals interacting in a marketplace.  If that view is held, if you built the kind of millionaire ghettos that were built on the southern coast of Britain, in Brighton and other places, the luxury pad, the yacht, marina and so on, and abandon the midlands, you will end up with the criminal situation and culture which gave rise to the horrific murder of Jamie Bulger.  People talk of tackling crime by recruiting additional gardaí and installing more security measures, it is ironic that one of those security measures identified the criminals who killed Jamie Bulger but, unfortunately, was not able to prevent his death.</P>
    <P>We should spend more time addressing what we need to do in society instead of providing technology, gardaí and prisons to deal with the problem.  We need to address the fundamental problem of our 300,000 unemployed.  The &ldquo;back to basics&rdquo; approach will lead quickly to the view that idle hands and idle minds will soon get up to mischief.  Unless our society can provide constructive work and leisure for many of the people who, through no fault of their own, are loafing around housing estates in this city and others, we will continue to have a serious crime problem.</P>
    <P>We must build communities and provide facilities in them.  I repeatedly hear of community sports groups and youth clubs who struggle to keep the show on <Col N="453" /> the road, but fail to get help from the State.  After this debate I am going to a meeting in Loughlinstown to talk to a community group whose community centre was burned down two weeks ago in an act of vandalism.  The Garda are still investigating the matter and have interviewed some people but they do not appear to be close to bringing charges. The community group and the group who ran the centre and other activities including a play school, a summer project and a youth club want to rebuild the centre. I held my clinic in the centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>They probably thought I was inside.  There is no assistance to rebuild that centre.  It does not make sense for the Minister to provide money to build prisons and not to provide money to build community centres in areas where they are needed.  The national lottery produces an annual profit in the region of £70 million and a tiny slice of it is released &mdash; usually before an election &mdash; by the Government as largesse.  The bulk of the national lottery funds are being plundered by Government Departments to fill spending holes when the money should be used to provide community and sport facilities which would help local people to build the type of community they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many groups give their time freely. Last week I met a woman who runs an after school group.  She voluntarily organises after school activities for 100 young people in an area of high unemployment. She organises trips to the Concert Hall, films and so on.  They are constructive activities and help to ensure that 13 to 14 year olds will not end up hiding behind a hedge drinking cider or using an illegal substance.  The people who organise such activities receive no assistance.  Instead of trying to solve the crime problem by building more prisons we should put in resources at an early stage to create a climate in local communities that prevents people from getting into trouble and helps those who <Col N="454" /> are already trying to build a sense of community and keep young people out of trouble.  By all means let us bring the Garda up to strength and reform the way in which they do their business.  Let us go back to having gardaí on the streets in contact with the public.  Let us try the ideas that will release highly trained gardaí from mundane tasks and enable them to get on with the serious work of detecting and preventing crime.  Let us not, however, forget where crime begins. We must concentrate more on our efforts on building a decent society.  Then we will have more decent people in that society, probably fewer offenders and less need to spend huge sums of money at the end of the line when we could have spent it more profitably at the beginning to keep people out of trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to a very wide-ranging debate on the excellent and timely motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I wonder if we would be discussing the important matter of crime in this House were it not for the vehicle of Private Members' Time.  I hope on this occasion the Government can do more than just vote down the motion by way of approving the ministerial amendment and can produce a strategy that will improve confidence in the tools available within the society to halt raging and spiralling crime throughout the country. I do not intend to cover all aspects of the matter.  I do not intend to refer to the more alarming instances of serious crime in the past few weeks.  I would, however, like to nail the suggestion that behind the tabling of this motion is undue criticism of the Garda Síochána.  It is regrettable that members of a Government party have unfairly accused Opposition Members of this House of being unduly critical of the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána is doing a good job. It could do better.  That it is not doing better is not its fault but the fault of the instruments and the vehicles that we as legislators have made available to it.  It is that aspect of the breakdown of order in <Col N="455" /> society that we should be addressing.  We are losing the battle against crime.  There is a strict obligation on us in this national assembly to prevent crime and ensure the application of appropriate punishment where crime is committed.  We have lost sight of the fact that the criminal justice system is a service which, like any other service, must have an element of quality control.  I wonder have we addressed the question of quality control within the criminal justice system.  What about the concept of a quality officer and annual reports that would show just what type of service we are providing for society in the context of law and order and the control of crime?</P>
      <P>We have to look at the justice system and the laws that we have made or failed to enact in the past few years to deal with the problem.  It may sound like a cliché, but to the 98 per cent of decent people it appears that the criminal justice system is weighted in favour of the offender.  Far too often justice is not seen to be done in our courts.  A suspect brought into a Garda station is under no obligation to contribute towards the finding of the truth that may at some stage lead to the solution of a crime.  It is absurd that, as we approach the end of the century in a modern western society, we have the concept of the right to silence.  It is outdated and should be scrapped at the earliest opportunity.  It is unacceptable that in response to serious Garda questioning a suspect can merely deliver the &ldquo;two fingers&rdquo; to a presiding garda officer or, alternatively, can remain seated on a chair and count the raindrops on the window and make no contribution to the process in which he is asked to engage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abolition of the right to silence must be accompanied by a number of safeguards.  We have had these safeguards built into our law since the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. It is regrettable that many portions of that Bill are not yet law because the regulations necessary to bring them into force have still to be introduced.  I wonder at the lack of progress in ensuring that in the interview rooms at least of each Garda <Col N="456" /> division throughout the country &mdash; that is not asking for too much &mdash; there would be a proper system of audio and video equipment to record any conversation or discussion that occurs, to be produced if needed at a later date.  If that were done it would change the concept of the right to silence as we know it.  What would anybody have to fear if the proceedings were on tape, preferably on video?  What gave rise to the right to silence was the concern that a suspect might be unfairly treated or that undue influence might be brought to bear on him or her.  That could be remedied by using the provisions of the 1984 Act.  Ten years have passed and we are still not in position to provide the appropriate remedy.</P>
    <P>A statistic was put to me recently which I did not at first believe.  However, I am led to believe that 80 per cent of convictions in the Circuit and High Courts are achieved on a plea of guilty. That means that 20 per cent of our criminal cases are proved by way of direct evidence where a party is pleading not guilty.  That is a poor reflection on our criminal justice system.  I do not blame the Garda.  I blame the equipment that we as a Legislature have given it to manage our criminal justice system.  Far too many cases have never gone beyond the desk of the Director of Public Prosecutions for lack of fundamental evidence.</P>
    <P>Freedom of a type taken for granted a few years ago is now under threat.  People are living in fear for their personal safety and that of their possessions both within and without the confines of their family home.  We do not have a select committee on crime and there is no attempt by the Department of Justice to modernise and codify our criminal law.  We saw the far-reaching introduction of a Minister for Law Reform who has no powers in the area of crime.  The Department of Justice is simply too big.  No Minister is able to report what type of progress is necessary because of its many arms of responsibility. It is a pity that Minister Taylor, the Minister of Equality and Law Reform, has no role in this area.  Neither do we have a criminal law reform commission <Col N="457" /> which is essential if the Government is to be equipped with the appropriate level of expertise and advice to bring in laws that will rectify matters.</P>
    <P>The bail system is ludricrous but there is not much point in changing our bail laws unless we provide for a remand centre.  Will the Minister say whether a constitutional referendum would be necessary to change the bail laws?  We have been talking about this matter for years and the position is unclear.  If a referendum is necessary it should be held on 9 June.</P>
    <P>I regret that the time of my disposal is limited.  The Department is too big.  The Minister and her officials appear to lack the will and the expertise to tackle the raging problem of crime in our society. If it is not tackled rapidly the repercussions for society will be enormous.</P>

      <P>I was astounded at the two points made by Deputy Flanagan as central to his case.  I wonder where the Deputy has been for the past 16 months. Does he not realise that there has been more reform of the criminal law in those months than at any time in the history of the State, and the record shows that? Deputy Flanagan referred to the audio and video taping of suspects in police stations.  That was provided for in legislation passed by the Deputy's party in 1984.  As in many other matters, the Minister is taking the initiative and putting in place that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime is a serious problem in society. The Government recognises this and is committed to tackling the problem.  The rapid increase in crime is a phenomenon that is being experienced in most societies as we approach the end of the 20th century. It is particularly marked in urban areas.  The causes, effects and ways in which to combat crime are the subject of very wide debate.  Although there are good reasons for believing that crime in Ireland is not as serious as that in many other countries, I accept this is no ground <Col N="458" /> for complacency.  On the contrary, we have to move more quickly to put in place the necessary resources, policies and strategies to contain the problem before it escalates to the levels being experienced elsewhere, and that is what the Government is doing.  That is what the law and order package, the major review of prison policy, to be published shortly, and the wide range of criminal law reform measures introduced by the Government are about.</P>
    <P>Against the background of increasing crime in Irish society, particularly urban society, as part of a worldwide trend, the response of the main Opposition party has been strange, to put it mildly.  The performance of Deputy Gay Mitchell as spokesman on justice has been a cut below the rest.  The Deputy will establish himself as the political stuntsman <i>par excellence</i> of Irish political history because he comes in here day after day making baseless allegations, having worked himself into a frenzy of false indignation.  Apparently his only purpose is to appear on the 6 o'clock news, the 9 o'clock news or Oireachtas Report.  This is soundbite politics and is unworthy of a party with the traditions of Fine Gael. That party always prided itself as a party of law and order.</P>

Playing on the fears of the old, sick, weak and infirm in society is blatant and sickening political electioneering.  The use of the horrific events of recent weeks for party political purposes shows that we have reached a new low in Irish politics.  I repudiate Deputy Bruton's remarks of this morning.  The Deputy has reached a stage of desperation where the only time he opens his mouth is to change his feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I was appointed spokesman on justice some time ago I have published more Bills and discussion documents and brought before the House more motions, questions and amendments to Bills than any other Deputy in the House, and I make no apology for doing so.  I did not spend £6 million of taxpayers' money on public relations stunts.  I do my own public relations and the Minister will find out how good I am at doing so when he knocks on the doors in Crumlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be intimidated by the veiled threats made by the Minister last night, nor by the innuendo in her speech against a former public servant.  I will defend the reputation of all public servants.  I want to lay the truth before the House.  I requested two Fine Gael Deputies to ask the Minister for Justice on 27 April 1994 &mdash; my own questions were used up &mdash; why she had directed that Garda headquarters be changed from Oughterard to Salthill in her constituency.  In reply the Minister said: &ldquo;On the basis of my own detailed knowledge of the particular area in question, I came to the conclusion that there was a need for a redistribution and changes in the stationing of Garda resources in the Salthill region&rdquo;.  She went on to say: &ldquo;Accordingly, under the powers conferred on me by section 6 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, I directed the Garda Commissioner that a redistribution <Col N="460" /> of resources should be brought about&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I raised that matter on the Order of Business on 18 May, as is my duty as main Opposition spokesman on justice, but the Minister sat mute.  She said in the Seanad that night: &ldquo;As regards the upgrading of Salthill to district headquarters level, I have already fully outlined the circumstances which led to this decision by way of reply to a Dáil question and unless Senators think otherwise, I see no reason to waste the time of this House by repeating what I have already put on record&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister came in here and said:</P>
    <P>I make no apologies to anyone for exercising my statutory functions, whether in relation to prisons or the location of Garda administrative headquarters. Is it seriously suggested that I should in some way ignore my personal knowledge when I make decisions as provided for in law on issues affecting my constituency?  As regards the location of the Garda district headquarters, it is not true, as has been suggested, that I acted in defiance of Garda advice.  In fact, a strong case was made to me by Garda management based on the crime statistics, population trends and general policing issues to the effect that it was a nonsense to have policing in Salthill and its hinterland directed from a less central location at a considerable remove from the main population centre in the Garda district.</P>
    <P>If these decisions were made by the Garda Commissioner they may be the right ones, but the Minister told the House she directed the Garda Commissioner, and she told the Seanad she had nothing to add to that.  She told this House last night that she had acted on the advice of Garda management.  From that I can only presume that Garda management down the line requested the Minister to direct the Garda Commissioner &mdash; that is the implications of what the Minister is saying.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to ask me what <Col N="461" /> I would do in Crumlin or Drimnagh.  If I did in Crumlin or Drimnagh what the Minister did in Galway she would accuse me of abusing powers for personal political advantage.  I accuse the Minister of doing that, and the record shows that to be the case.  It is improper for her to become so involved.  Is it any wonder morale is so low in the Garda Síochána? Is it any wonder that in the Clare-Galway region Garda superintendents are looking over their shoulders and are afraid to commit resources to action because the Minister knows more than they do?  Two versions of the story have been given: first that the Minister directed the Commissioner and second that the case was made to her by Garda management.</P>
    <P>I made a further allegation, that the Minister for Justice personally vets applications by prisoners from Galway for compassionate leave, temporary release, transfers to open prisons, training and such matters.  The Minister in the House made veiled threats that she would disclose what other Ministers had done.  I will not bend to the Minister's veiled threats.  Her action represents cruel and degrading treatment of prisoners who were treated in a certain way for personal political advantage.  It is also totally unfair to other communities.  Why should a community in Connemara be treated any different from a community in Crumlin? Why does the Minister personally vet the release of prisoners in her constituency while the rest of the country must make do with the existing system, albeit an imperfect one?  I accuse the Minister on both of those fronts of political impropriety and it is scandalous that Deputy Costello is not present to support me on these matters.  It is my duty as Opposition spokesperson on Justice to make these points and to hold the Minister accountable for action which amounts to an abuse of power and cannot be justified.  I want this to stop and when it has, I will cease raising the issue.  No amount of personal abuse or veiled threats will make me change in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the debate the Minister asked Fine Gael to tell her under what legislation <Col N="462" /> she should have taken action against the Provos who paraded in this city last night and who were pictured in the newspapers this morning, dressed in their uniforms in Finglas, to the total disgrace of the security of the State.  Who will invest in a country where paramilitaries are photographed on the front page of one newspaper and the middle page of another? Does the Minister believe such behaviour will go without retribution?  Does she want this part of the island to be in the same state that has come about in Northern Ireland?  Those people cannot be given their head.  Will we stop them when they are on the steps of Leinster House?</P>
    <P>We are a democracy and we have laws and, for the information of the Minister, Article 15.6. of Bunreacht na hÉireann states:</P>
    <P>1ºThe right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas</P>
    <P>2ºNo military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Section 15 (1) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, states:</P>
    <P>Save as authorised by a Minister of State under this section, and subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned, it shall not be lawful for any assembly of persons to practise or to train or drill themselves in or be trained or drilled in the use of arms or the performance of military exercises, evolutions, or manoeuvres nor for any persons to meet together or assemble for the purpose of so practising or training or drilling or being trained or drilled.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>If any person is present at or takes part in or gives instruction to or trains or drills an assembly of persons who without or otherwise than in accordance with an authorisation granted by a Minister of State under this section practise, or train or drill themselves in, or are trained or drilled in the use <Col N="463" /> of arms or the performance of any military exercise, evolution, or manoeuvre or who without or otherwise than in accordance with such authorisation have assembled or met together for the purpose of so practising, or training or drilling or being trained or drilled, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>If those people last night were not Provos, if they were ordinary criminals, what would have happened to them?  I will tell the Minister what would have happened to them.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1994, would have been used against them.  They would not have been allowed to assemble.  They would have been told to move on and if they did not move on they would have been arrested and held without warrant. Under section 25 of that Act, if they resisted arrest they would have been guilty of a further offence.  Why is one law applied to every day criminals but not applied to the criminal IRA who plant bombs, shoot people and blow children out of the arms of their parents?</P>
    <P>Romantic Ireland is not dead and gone; it lives in the heads of some people in this House and the sooner we get those romantic ideas out of our heads, the better.  Those people fully intend to march all the way to the steps of Leinster House if we do not stop them.  Allowing them to parade around this city and country in uniform in this manner is a gross offence and it will be too late for action when the bombs are going off in Connemara and in Crumlin, and when this country is turned into another Rwanda or Yugoslavia.  We cannot turn a blind eye to the activities of these people. Murder by any name is murder; mayhem by any name is mayhem.  I urge the Minister not to pussyfoot with these people. They want the upper hand.  We have given them the freedom of the airwaves, now they want the freedom to parade <Col N="464" /> and show their military might and use that to intimidate the rest of us.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity last night to put before the House a ten point plan to deal with crime.  I have raised this matter here before and I will continue to raise it because it is serious.  Deputy Haughey, in an otherwise fine contribution, stated that people were not living in fear.  People are living in fear, they are afraid of the Provos.  Martin McGuinness praised the Taoiseach this evening at an IRA funeral. He described Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, as a quisling.  Quisling sold out to the Nazis but we are very determined that we will never sell out to terrorists, whether they are IRA, UFF or others.  Those people are determined to bring murder, mayhem and catastrophe to this side of the Border.  That is the clear distinction between Fine Gael and slightly constitutional parties in this House.  We have never been and never will be fellow travellers of the IRA.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another point in the time remaining.  Some weeks ago I published a lengthy document, which was given a soundbite by the Minister of State.  It was a 60 page document which took quite a long time to prepare and I must pay tribute to the Fine Gael Front Bench and to members of Young Fine Gael for jointly producing it.  We deliberately involved Young Fine Gael because we did not want a hanging and flogging document. We wanted a document that was compassionate by one that worked.  This document is about prison reform.</P>
    <P>Last night I read into the record of the House the introduction to that document. It contains substantial recommendations and if we are serious about dealing with the crime problem, the issue of penal reform must be put centre stage. We need a parole board; people should not be released from prison without objective consideration, not by the Minister in relation to her constituency, but by a parole board.  We should have an inspector of prisons.  Statistics on the prison system are always out of date and not very informative.  We also need a prisons board so that we can find out what is going on in prisons.  The prison <Col N="465" /> system is not contributing to the solution of the problem, it is contributing to the problem itself.  If raising this matter here makes me a do gooder, then I am a do gooder but if we are to spend £250,000 per cell for an additional 200 cells, a total of £50 million, and up to £40,000 a year per prisoner, we must get value for that money.  We must have a system that is reforming, rehabilitative, efficient and effective, otherwise we are simply expanding the base of a recycling institute for criminals where people go in without a drugs problem and come out with a drugs problem and who then prey on the rest of the community to feed that habit.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed <Col N="466" /> to the debate this evening.  I have made suggestions to the House from time to time.  I am sorry the old political hackery continues and the Minister persists in putting on the record of the House worn out statements about alleged expenditure. Her predecessor said he would build the strength of the Garda Force up to 12,000 but its strength is now 500 below what it was when we left office.  If the Minister takes time off from directing her campaign in Connacht to visit Crumlin, Drimnagh, Terenure and Harold's Cross she will find out exactly what the people think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for being present.  This very important issue is of concern not only to the farmers involved but to all farmers. The rules governing the ewe premium scheme are bonkers and the insanely rigid adherence by the Department to these rules is worthy of exposure.  Farmers stand to lose approximately £10 million because 30 per cent of the application forms will be deemed to have been incorrectly filled in.  There are 52,000 sheep flocks in the country and of the 7,500 sheep farmers in County Galway approximately 2,500 are in grave danger of losing either their ewe premium or ewe hogget grant or both.</P>
      <P>Last Monday morning a farmer outside Loughrea had an inspection to assess his eligibility under the ewe premium scheme.  He applied for this premium on 154 sheep which were presented and accepted to be in order.  However, he made a minor error when filling in his form in that he omitted to say that 65 of the 254 sheep were ewe hoggets, which are entitled to an extra headage payment of £10 per head.  This means that the farmer has lost £650, and was so informed by the inspector.</P>
      <P>A few miles away another Loughrea farmer who had applied for the ewe premium and gave the correct number of ewe hoggets, five, and the correct total flock number, 60, omitted to insert the figure 55 for the ewes in the small box marked A.  His losses are even worse &mdash; he will lose the entire premium on the 55 ewes, which amounts to approximately £1,300.  What crime would a person have to commit for a judge in a court of law to fine him £1,300?  I believe it would have to be a very serious crime.  The Minister and his Minister of State seem to have lost all authority in the administration of these schemes.</P>
      <P>The irony is that an inspector who inspects the flocks is not allowed to rectify minor mistakes, should he see fit to do so.  Inspectors should be given sufficient latitude to correct any minor errors which can lead to a loss of income for farmers. I want to make it absolutely clear that I hold no brief whatsoever for any farmer who tries to defraud the Department of moneys.  However, any minor errors made in the filling of a very complicated form should not lead to farmers losing up to half their income.  If the Department inspector is satisfied that a genuine error has been made in filling in the application and that the sheep for which the premium was applied for are present then the grant should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two major questions arise from this matter.  The number of forms incorrectly filled in is approximately 30 per cent.  I did not pick that figure out of the air &mdash; I have carried out some research.  Most farmers do not realise this as the grants under the ewe hogget scheme will not be paid until next November and, due to pressure, the livestock offices have not told them.  The livestock office telephoned one of the farmers to tell him that there was something wrong with his application form.  He was asked for a dipping certificate and to set out in a letter the reasons the application form was not properly filled in.  Even though all this information was supplied, I was told by the Department in writing that the farmer could not be paid the grant. <Col N="469" /> If the problem is as widespread as I believe it is, why would the Department allow a situation to develop where farmers and, in turn, the economy, will be left without £8-£10 million simply because these application forms were incompletely filled in.  I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the ewe premium scheme farmers are entitled to apply for premium in respect of all breeding ewes that have lambed at least once and any other ewes that will be one year old by 7 June 1994.  Under the sheep headage scheme farmers are entitled to apply for headage payments in respect of all mountain breeding ewes substantially maintained on mountain grazings and on hogget ewes, born in 1993, maintained on both mountain and lowland grazing. For ease of administration and in order to reduce the amount of paper work for individual flockowners, the ewe premium scheme and sheep headage scheme are included on one composite application form.  The form has been in use in its present format for a number of years already.  The ewe premium scheme is on schedule 1 of the application form while the sheep headage scheme is on schedule 2.  I understand that the Deputy's question relates to two separate flockowners to whom I will refer as applicant A and applicant B.</P>
      <P>Applicant A completed the ewe premium part of the application form and applied for premium in respect of 89 breeding ewes and 65 hogget ewes &mdash; a total of 154 sheep.  He did not complete the sheep headage part of the application form but simply drew a line through schedule 2.  Applicant B completed the ewe premium part of the application form and applied for premium in respect of 59 breeding ewes only.  He did not complete the sheep headage part of the application form.  He also supplied a dipping certificate in respect of 60 breeding ewes only.  <i>Prima facie</i>, therefore, neither of these flockowners made a valid application for sheep headage payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is obliged, under EU <Col N="470" /> regulations, to carry out administrative checks on all applications for headage and premia schemes.  These administrative checks are supplemented by on-farm inspections in a percentage of cases. The question of whether an applicant is entitled to be paid grants under the headage and premia schemes cannot be determined until all these checks have been completed.  Decisions on entitlements under the 1944 ewe premium and sheep headage schemes have not yet been made.</P>
    <P>Applicant A was subject to an on-farm inspection during which he presented a total of 154 sheep for the ewe premium scheme.  Applicant B was not subject to an on-farm inspection.  He should be eligible for ewe premium payments in respect of the 59 ewes on which he applied, subject to compliance with the retention period requirement, and so on. Our records suggest that this particular applicant is not entitled to sheep headage as he does not have mountain grazings on which to graze mountain breeding ewes nor does he have hogget ewes grazed on lowlands which would also be eligible for headage payments.  If this does not reflect the true position, I will have the case re-examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get the details from the Deputy later.</P>
      <P>These cases highlight once again the difficulty my Department faces in making payments in respect of premia and hedage applications by farmers who do not complete the application forms carefully and fully.  Any apparent omissions by farmers normally will come to light only at payment stage when an individual becomes aware that he has not been paid in respect of a particular scheme.  In turn this leads to delays in payments for those farmers who made an effort to complete appiciation forms fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All premia and headage schemes are now subject to EU regulations governing an integrated administration and contol <Col N="471" /> system.  Those regulations were extended to the disadvantaged area headage schemes for the first time in 1994.  While my Department was previously in a position to exercise some discretion in regard to headage schemes the position is no longer as flexible under the new EU rules.  I have stated on many occasions that I fully appreciate the complexity of the schemes both from the point of view of the farmers and of the administration. Farmers have found it necessary to devote much time and effort to the completion of the necessary documentation which is an essential part of the new regime under the CAP reforms.  My Department in conjunction with Teagasc, has made great efforts to give the necessary information and help to all farmers.</P>
    <P>Given that the schemes involve a considerable amount of money &mdash; as much as £640 million when the CAP reforms are fully in place in 1995 &mdash; it is not unreasonable that the European commission lays down very specific conditions for the filling of forms and the meeting of other requirements.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to carry out a full re-examination of the application form submitted by applicant A and those of any other farmers in a similar position, with a view to ensuring payment of full entitlements.  As already stated, no decisions have yet been made on foot of 1994 applications for premia and headage schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Bed and breakfast accommodation is completely unsuitable for young people for whom the health boards have responsibility.  These children and young people are totally vulnerable when placed in such accommodation.  They wander the streets all day with aid of £5 from a community welfare officer and as a result are more likely to get into trouble with the law and become criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> There has been optimism about the provisions of the Child Care Act but social workers and other professionals involved in child care are being put in an impossible position on account of the lack of residential places for children.  Organisations working with the homeless have disputed the figures furnished to me by the Minister for Health in reply to a parliamentary question concerning the availability of residential accommodation for homeless children.  They are worried about the standard of bed and breakfast accommodation, the quality of care and the suitability of such accommodation for these children.</P>
    <P>In my role as a social worker before being elected to this House I was aware that anybody dealing with children in care must be the subject of intense investigation, ensuring that certain standards are maintained.  For example, in the case of a foster parent providing residential care for children, strict assessment procedures apply.  Why should bed and breakfast accommodation be considered suitable for young people?  Why should 25 young people have spent the night in bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin on Monday last?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a clear statement and issue guidelines to all health boards.  He might assure the House that he does not consider bed and breakfast accommodation suitable for young people.  We may well be faced with circumstances in which a major tragedy may occur, with an attendant investigation into the usage of bed and breakfast accommodation for young people.  I understand that some of these young people, along with some owners of bed and breakfast establishments, are very unhappy with the position and that disturbing stories are beginning to emerge about young people being introduced to drugs when placed in this type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>People may well ask why there is an increasing problem with child homelessness in Dublin and elsewhere. The reasons are many and complex.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is the incidence of <Col N="473" /> increasing poverty among families, accompanied by marital problems.  I am informed that, because of the reduction in emigration, agencies in London are not dealing with as many young vulnerable Irish people as in the past.  Thus, these children's needs have to be met here.  The increase is also because the health boards have responsibility to provide accommodation for homeless children up to the age of 18.  Under the provision of section 3 the health boards have a responsibility to promote the welfare of children and bed and breakfast accommodation does not do that.  As section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, places a statutory obligation on health boards to provide &ldquo;reasonable, suitable and appropriate accommodation for homeless children&rdquo; will the Minister outline to the House how bed and breakfast accommodation for vulnerable, homeless children can be construed as either reasonable, appropriate or suitable?  In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said that children as young as 12 years of age are being placed in unsupervised, unsuitable and inappropriate bed and breakfast accommodation, not just in the Eastern Health Board region but in the majority of health boards.  The reality is that almost all health boards use this type of accommodation for homeless children.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board region, where the problem is most acute, the official number of homeless children placed in bed and breakfast accommodation has increased from 39 in 1991 to 75 in 1993.  There are insufficient facilities for homeless children and the health boards are becoming increasingly reliant on bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>In theory children have a right to proper accommodation but, in fact, they are not getting it.  The dangers must be obvious to all Members and the Minister must issue guidelines.  If the Minister for Health was present I would remind him of his concerns in this regard when he contributed to the Child Care Bill earlier. He was pessimistic about the use of section 5 and separating homeless children from other children.  He was right <Col N="474" /> to be pessimistic because it is clear that homeless children are not getting the range of services they need.  It is not a case of lack of funding but a lack of political will to address the issue.  It will result in untold damage, physical and psychological, to these children.  Will the Minister issue instructions to each health board prohibiting the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless children?  If he is not prepared to do this, Members and the public at large will remember that the Minister condoned the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless children.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Child Care Act, 1991, provides a statutory obligation on health boards to provide a range of child care and family support services of children up to 18 years of age.  Section 5 of the Act states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where it appears to a health board that a child in its area is homeless the board shall enquire into the child's circumstances, and if the board is satisfied that there is no accommodation available to him which he can reasonably occupy, then, unless the child is received into the care of the health board under the provisions of the Act, the Board shall take such steps as are reasonable to make available suitable accommodation for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns expressed about the placement of homeless children in bed and breakfast accommodation. The Department of Health has made it clear to the health boards that the use of this form of accommodation is not, as a general rule, an acceptable response to the problem and that all reasonable efforts must be made to provide appropriate hostel, residential or family placements for homeless children.  At the same time however, it must be recognised that sometimes there is no other alternative to the use of bed and breakfast accommodation, particularly in an emergency or in cases where the homeless youngster refuses the health board's offer of a place <Col N="475" /> in a hostel or other residential setting.  In such a situation the youngster may opt to stay on the streets unless the health board provides him with bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the considerable progress made in providing funding for the implementation of the Child Care Act, including the provision of funding for the young homeless.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the following additional developments were approved in the Eastern Health Board Area: additional funding of Focus Point &ldquo;Off the Streets&rdquo; project which provide accommodation for difficult to place youngsters, additional funding for Eccles Street hostel to increase places from 12 to 14; provision of funding for a boy's hostel at Botanic Road, Glasnevin; funding for accommodation for adolescent girls at Salvation Army, Eden Quay; Streetline, North Circular Road &mdash; four places and Sisters of Charity, Deansgrange &mdash; five places.</P>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board areas: Provision was made for a grant of £100,000 towards development of Termon Residential Centre for homeless girls.</P>
    <P>In the Western Health Board area a new service for young homeless and abused spouses is being developed in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>The practice of placing homeless children in bed and breakfast accommodation is not widespread.  It is mainly confined to the Eastern Health Board area where the incidence of youth homelessness is highest.  The current position with regard to the Eastern Health Board is that there are six children under the age of 16 years and 19 children between the ages of 16 and 18 years in bed and breakfast accommodation. However, there are particular circumstances which apply in the Eastern Health Board area with regard to the implementation of section 5 of the Act as it applies to the 16-18 year old age category.  Under instruction from the local branch of their union IMPACT social workers attached to the Eastern Health Board area are currently not <Col N="476" /> operating this section of the Act.  As a consequence homeless youngsters in this category have to be dealt with by the community welfare service and in many cases the only placement that that service can arrange is in bed and breakfast accommodation.  The absence of the social worker services means that these youngsters are not assessed as to the reasons they are homeless and whether they could return home voluntarily.  Discussions are continuing between the board and the union representing the social workers and I hope that there will be an early resolution to his dispute.</P>
    <P>I am determined that further improvements will be made in the current year with the continued development of the child care services generally.  These improvements will, through earlier intervention with family support services and through increased facilities for homeless youth provide a better service for these unfortunate youngsters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this important and sensitive matter.  I wish to address the unsatisfactory conditions under which the staff and patients of St. Luke's Hospital have been forced to operate during the past few weeks.  The hospital provides radiation therapy to two thirds of our nation's cancer patients.  Until today the hospital's sole simulator &mdash; the instrument that designs the precise radiation treatment for patients &mdash; had been broken for two and a half weeks.  The machine is out of date and rather than have it replaced, new machinery had simply been added to keep it up to date and operational.  As a result, the machine is now so hybridised that a specialist from Germany had to be called in to fix it.  This is a case of lack of foresight snowballing into a crisis.  If St. Luke's had initially been provided with the funding to purchase an up-to-date machine, when the present simulator started to give trouble, repairs could have <Col N="477" /> been handled in a less expensive and time consuming fashion.</P>
      <P>The situation at St. Luke's was further compounded by the simultaneous breakdown of two of the three linear accelerators, which provide the bulk of the treatment in radiotherapy.  As a result the hospital on which we rely to treat the majority of our cancer patients had been unable to design precise treatment and deliver it to those patients.</P>
      <P>Patients have been forced to wait for radiotherapy, either being sent back home or remaining in the hospital for an extended period, in many cases, resorting to bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation at considerable expense to themselves and their families or, alternatively, staying with family friends in Dublin.  Seventeen people were flown to Cork Regional Hospital last weekend in an attempt to reduce the backlog of patients waiting for treatment.</P>
      <P>Staff have had to resort to working on a triage basis, accommodating those patients in greatest need first and leaving less advanced cases to wait.  This is ludicrous. Cancer requires early treatment to improve the chances of success in combating this insidious disease.  That such treatment should be handled on a triage basis in a society with adequate resources should be unthinkable, yet, it is a reality.</P>
      <P>Lacking the appropriate equipment the staff have been compelled to use laborious time-consuming and outdated methods to provide radiotherapy.  Many staff members have been working double shifts, administering treatment until midnight. They are to be commended and I compliment them on their heroic efforts to cope with this unacceptable situation. Fortunately, the simulator is functioning once again and the two linear accelerators will be operational within a week. The brunt of the crisis has passed but there is still a backlog of patients awaiting treatment.  The demands upon staff and patients have not decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that St. Luke's was informed today that £1.9 million is to be made available to build two new rooms to accommodate two new linear accelerators. It will also obtain a new <Col N="478" /> simulator in September.  This is progress but unfortunately the benefits will not be seen for several months.</P>
    <P>This urgent matter is being dealt with, but in a far from satisfactory fashion.  An exhausted, demoralised hospital staff has had to work overtime using inefficient methods to provide treatment for which a huge number of patients have been forced to wait.  How did this crisis come about?  It should not take a crisis to make us understand that the hospital which is the primary provider of cancer treatment should be adequately equipped with up-to-date functioning equipment.  This should not be an ideal which we should strive to achieve, it should be the reality. No amount of delayed funding can justify the frustration, demoralisation, anxiety and inconvenience suffered by the staff and patients of St. Lukes's Hospital during the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>This matter was brought to my attention by one of my constituents, one of the many cancer patients forced to wait for treatment.  This constituent is a member of the VHI and a private patient. If she is unable to obtain treatment, what about medical card holders?  How are their cases being handled?  Are they being forced to wait longer than private patients?  It is frightening to think that any cancer patient has to wait any length of time for treatment.</P>
    <P>The implications of this crisis at St. Luke's are disturbing.  One cannot but question our own priorities and our sympathy for those suffering from cancer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for giving me the opportunity of responding to this very important issue.  I am particularly sensitive to the fact that any negative publicity in relation to the treatment of cancer patients can cause serious distress to patients and their families and I am pleased to be able to allay any fears on this matter.  As the Deputy has rightly said, the simulator in St. Luke's-St. Anne's Hospital is back in service.  The breakdown of this simulator has not interrupted the treatment of patients and I am assured by the hospital that patient <Col N="479" /> care has not been compromised in any way.</P>
      <P>The simulator machine to which the Deputy has referred is not a treatment machine.  Treatment is delivered by either a linear accelerator or a cobalt unit.  Radiotherapy treatment at the hospital continued in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The purpose of simulation is to plan individual patient treatment.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that once a patient's treatment has been simulated, his course of treatment can continue uninterrupted despite the breakdown of the simulator.  I acknowledge that some patients have been inconvenienced and I very much regret this but I am assured by the hospital that there have been no delays which could have compromised the treatment process or endangered patient care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend both hospitals involved, St. Luke's-St. Anne's and Cork Regional Hospital for the speedy manner in which alternative arrangements were put in place.  St. Luke's-St. Anne's provided a similar service to Cork Regional Hospital when that hospital encountered some equipment difficulties in 1991.  These <Col N="480" /> arrangements are part of the necessary fall-back procedures which specialist units such as St. Luke's-St. Anne's would be expected to have in place in the event of equipment failure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that, following the decision late last year by the hospital's board to adopt a strategic plan for the hospital, a joint hospital-Department project team was appointed to plan for and oversee the transfer of services at present provided by St. Anne's Hospital to the St. Luke's Hospital campus.  One of the key areas to be examined by this project team is the equipment needs of the new hospital which will be developed as a national centre of excellence in the treatment and care of cancer patients.  I have been informed by the project team that the development brief will be available within the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>The continuing revolution in telecommunications technologies, both satellite and land based, offers a range of opportunities to radio stations to expand their services to the rest of Europe and to other continents. It is solely a matter for RTE or individual local radio stations to decide <Col N="340" /> if they wish to disseminate their services in this way and, if so, to secure the technology or mix of technologies which present the best opportunities taking into account other factors including receiver ownership, copyright implications, terrestrial distribution systems and costs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of a short-wave service, I am not convinced, at this stage in the development of telecommunications technology, that short-wave presents the best option for the future, particularly in the context of potential listenership, in view of the costs of providing such a service and the quality deficiencies associated with short-wave transmissions.</P>

      <P>St. Helen's House is of undoubted architectural merit.  I am pleased to say that, following communication from me, the Commissioners of Public Works have entered this building in the Register of Historic Monuments under section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.  However, on the basis of preliminary advice received by me from the National Heritage Council on the development of a broad policy on the question of State acquisition of historic properties in private ownership, it would appear that, even if funds were available, there would be many other properties having a higher priority than St. Helen's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage of acquisition by land swap, as proposed, was illusory.  In reality, there is no difference to the <Col N="343" /> Exchequer between foregoing the revenue from the sale of surplus Government property and the expenditure of an equivalent sum on the purchase of St. Helen's.  As the Deputies are no doubt aware, the Beggar's Bush property was recently sold by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>RTE has recently commenced broadcasts of Radio 1 and 2FM on the ASTRA satellite which can be received throughout most of western Europe.  The service can be received via a satellite dish or cable system, provided cable operators are prepared to carry it.  RTE is offering the service free of charge to cable operators in Europe and are hopeful that as awareness of the service spreads so will its availability on cable systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE operates its terrestrial broadcast transmitters under the terms of international radio frequency planning agreements <Col N="347" /> and, while fringe area reception of its Radio 1 service in parts of the London area is possible, this is largely fortuitous. Such reception of distant radio transmissions is susceptible to interference from other radio services, manmade obstacles and natural phenomena.  The concentration of broadcasting and other radio communications services in urban areas, particularly so in London, increases the likelihood of severe interference to reception and is a factor over which RTE has no control.</P>

      <P>An application to assist the setting up of a new theatre in Longford was received by my Department on 5 October 1993. Although I was greatly impressed by the proposals made by the applicants &mdash;&ldquo;A Theatre for Longford&rdquo;, comprising the Backstage Theatre Group, Longford Slashers GAA Club and Longford County Council &mdash; there were no funds at my disposal in 1993 to support the project.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the funds at my disposal for 1994 enabled me to give detailed consideration to this application recently.  I was able to obtain the approval in principle of the Minister for Finance for a grant of £300,000 for the project.  Such approvals are subject to subsequent specific sanctions from the Department of Finance.  My Department is currently in consultation with that Department with a view to completing the final stage of the approval process.</P>

The project, combining a theatre and arts exhibition facility, provides a timely boost to the arts infrastructure of the Midlands and represents a welcome outcome to the efforts which the Backstage Theatre Group have been making to provide high quality drama attractions for Longford and the surrounding regions since 1982.</P>

      <P>The position is that, in line with EU requirements, sections 2 and 10 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, (as amended) lay down the principle that VAT is chargeable on the full consideration received by taxable persons in respect of supplies of goods and services made in the course of business.  In this context the rental of hire of goods is regarded as being a taxable service. Except where the VAT Act specifically provides for exemption or for the application of a reduced rate of VAT, all supplies of goods and services are liable to VAT at the 21 per cent rate.  It is on this basis that the rental of telephone equipment is liable to VAT at the 21 per <Col N="351" /> cent rate.  This is also the basis for the charge of VAT on telephone calls.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners recognise that some inconvenience may be caused to the taxpayer in the course of their carrying out a tax audit.  Being conscious of the fact that an audit itself should not prejudice the conduct of the person's business, every effort is made to ensure that these are completed in as short a time as is consistent with a quality audit. The full and prompt co-operation of the person being audited can go a long way towards ensuring that this disruption is kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many factors, including the possible seasonable nature of the business concerned, <Col N="352" /> as might be the case with farming, are taken into account in deciding when and in what form an audit is to undertaken.  These factors are kept under review in the light of experience and individual circumstances.  Furthermore in individual cases, where for good and sufficient reason, the proposed date for an audit is not suitable, an alternative date can be agreed.</P>
    <P>All tax audits are conducted within the framework of the taxpayers Charter of Rights, which includes a commitment by the Revenue Commissioners to minimise the cost to the taxpayer of their complying with Revenue law, subject to the Revenue's own responsibility of carrying out their functions efficiently and economically. I am satisfied that the interests of the taxpayers referred to by the Deputy are being catered for without the need for a specific moratorium along the lines suggested.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State who are aged 66 years or over as well as to certain incapacitated persons under that age who are in receipt of social welfare type payments in respect of incapacity such as invalidity pension or the disabled person's maintenance allowance administered by the health boards.  There are no plans at present to extend the free travel scheme to other categories of social welfare recipients, such as those in receipt of retirement pension.</P>
      <P>I might mention that one of the improvements announced in last January's budget allows widows between the age of 60 and 65, whose late husbands had entitlement to free travel and the other free schemes, to retain entitlement to them notwithstanding their age.  Any proposals for further extensions to those schemes would require additional resources and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The use of set-aside land for growing crops for nonfood purposes is permitted under EU regulations.  The availability of this option has been explained to farmers in publications and explanatory leaflets on the arable area aid schemes which were introduced in 1993 as part of the CAP reforms.  Officials of my Department have had discussions with a number of companies which are interested in pursuing the matter.</P>
      <P>The growing of crops for industrial purposes, of course, offers an opportunity to make some productive use of set-aside land and accordingly I would encourage activities of this nature.</P>

Since he was not an applicant in 1992 under the suckler cow premium scheme he did not have automatic right to quota.  However, he has recently been allocated a quota of 19 premium rights from the special reserve.  His application for grants under the 1993 scheme can now be processed and payment on 19 animals will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for additional suckler cow quota from the special reserve for small scale milk producers.  He declared that he had 38 cows on his holding on 1 April 1993 and that he used 14 of these to produce his milk quota.  Twenty of the remaining cows were dairy type (Friesians) but only seven of these were reckonable for grant and quota purposes on the basis that he had been paid on seven Friesians in 1990 and under EU Regulations he is allowed to include that number of dairy type cows up to and including 1994.  The remaining four cows were non-dairy type animals making a total of 11 eligible cows.  As he had already established a quota of ten premium rights, based on his 1992 application, he will now be allocated one extra premium right from the reserve making his total suckler cow quota 11 premium rights.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the return of cards submitted for special beef premium.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the special beef premium scheme that the cattle identity cards for the animals applied on have to accompany the application.  As there is a two month retention period from the date of lodgement of the application, the cattle identity cards are not normally returned before the end of the seventh week or early in the eighth week of the retention period.  I am satisfied that the vast majority of cattle identity cards in respect of one million animals submitted with January/February 1994 special beef premium scheme applications were returned to farmers before the end of the retention period.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government <Col N="365" /> stated that there would be investment to upgrade the Whitegate Refinery in order to remove the cost penalty from the Irish economy.  The timescale for achieving this objective was delineated by the Government's decision in response to the recommendations of the Culliton and Moriarty reports that the mandatory off-take of petroleum products from the refinery at cost-recovery prices must be terminated by the end of 1996 at the latest.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation is currently in the course of implementing a commercialisation plan involving investments of £26 million and marketing initiatives which will enable the refinery to compete at market prices from 1996.  A joint venture proposal to carry out a major upgrade of the refinery so that it can operate on a technological par with modern European refineries is also being considered.  For reasons of commercial confidentiality, further details of this proposal cannot be released at this time.</P>
      <P>The storage of crude oil at Whiddy Oil Terminal continues to play an important role in ensuring that our obligations to hold strategic oil stocks under EU legislation and International Energy Agency agreements are met.  The Government and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation are committed to exploring opportunities for resuming commercial activities at the terminal.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar Question No. 30 on 12 April 1994, I am in principle in favour of the introduction of a formal scheme to encourage people to donate paintings and works of art to the nation and my Department is at present examining how best this might be done.</P>

      <P>Submissions were received last year in my Department regarding research funding for the Irish ME Trust.  Health research is carried out under the aegis of the Health Research Board which has an open invitation policy regarding applications for research funding and allocates its resources annually according to the <Col N="369" /> priorities it attaches to the various requests received.</P>
      <P>The funding of voluntary bodies is primarily a matter for health boards who may provide grants to such organisations under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.  The ME Trust applied for lottery funding in 1992 but due to the demands on funds I was not able to accede to that request.  I have received no request for a meeting with the ME Trust.</P>
      <P>People with ME can avail of services provided in the normal course of health service provision through the health boards.  A general practitioner provides personal, primary and continuing care to individual patients and families.  In relation to medical conditions generally, including ME, a general practitioner will be concerned with prevention and anticipatory care as well as an effective response to illness and patient rehabilitation.</P>
