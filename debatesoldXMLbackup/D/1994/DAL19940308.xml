      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  The basis of the three strand talks under the 26 March 1991 statement is that it is open to any of the parties to raise any aspects of the <Col N="2" /> relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands, including constitutional issues.  Accordingly, at our initiative, we put the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, on the table in the course of the talks during 1992. The 1920 Act also formed part of the background to the formulation of the Joint Declaration, as far as we were concerned, as I shall explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always made it clear, since I took office, that in any negotiations the Government of Ireland Act would also be on the table alongside Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  This is with a view to achieving a balanced constitutional accommodation as part of an overall settlement, as referred to in paragraph 7 of the Joint Declaration of 15 December 1993.  The aim of a &ldquo;balanced constitutional <Col N="3" /> accommodation&rdquo; as part of an agreed package is also contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is the principal counterpart to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution, and each is a statement of the formal constitutional position of Ireland and Britain, with regard to the <i>de jure</i> status of Northern Ireland.  It is natural that in seeking to arrive at a balanced constitutional accommodation both statements should be on the table, so that balanced consideration can be given to the question of what reformulation, refinement, or restatement may be required on either side.</P>
    <P>I recognise the fundamental importance and sensitivity of this question for people in both communities in Northern Ireland.  I have always approached the question in a constructive and conciliatory way, and not in any spirit of coercion.  I have sought to point out that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, embodied a constitutional compromise, which has largely been lost sight of in the intervening period.  Indeed, the abandonment of the compromise, and of the Council of Ireland in the 1925 Boundary Agreement is perhaps one of the reasons the Northern Ireland troubles resurfaced later.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand the original basis and terms on which partitition was enacted.  The legislation is far more than just a bald statement of British sovereignty, and was never purely negative from an Irish Nationalist point of view.  Even Article 75 was the basis on which the British Government was able to abolish Stormont and end majority rule in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution and the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, while apparently in direct opposition to each other, have one vital principle in common.  They are both based on the principle of the essential unity of Ireland.  The Government of Ireland Act in section 2 envisaged a Council of Ireland &ldquo;with a view to the eventual establishment of a Parliament for the <Col N="4" /> whole of Ireland, to bring about harmonious action between the parliaments and Governments&rdquo; North and South and &ldquo;to the promotion of mutual intercourse and uniformity in relation to matters affecting the whole of Ireland&rdquo;.  Under section 10 it also had the power to exercise delegated powers with respect to railways, fisheries and animal hygiene.  It had the power to &ldquo;consider any questions which may appear in any way to bear on the welfare&rdquo; of both North and South, and it was asked to consider &ldquo;what Irish services might in the common interest be administered by a body having jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Council of Ireland were explicitly carried over into the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was also based on the principle of the essential unity of Ireland, with an opt-out clause. While parts of the 1920 Act were subsequently superseded, it was, nevertheless, the foundation stone of Northern Ireland.  The Council of Ireland was revived in the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973.</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland Act also contained in section 5 a very explicit provision intended to outlaw any religious discrimination, and prevent any law that would directly or indirectly &ldquo;give a preference, privilege, or advantage, or enforce any disability or disadvantage, on account of religious belief&rdquo;.  There is now a strong parallel to this at the end of paragraph 5 of the Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>My argument in relation to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, has always been that the compromise and balanced accommodation it contained in relation to the North and to partition has never been implemented.  There were three principles: despite partition, the underlying unity of Ireland was not contested, and the long term aim was to reestablish political unity; it envisaged the establishment of joint bodies and institutions with executive authority; it outlawed religious discrimination.</P>
    <P>In other words, partition was never intended to give an unfettered freehold to the majority community in Northern Ireland to do as they wished.  The same <Col N="5" /> Act, which proclaimed British sovereignty in Northern Ireland, made the re-establishment of Irish political unity a long term aim, provided in the meantime mechanisms to have both parts of the island working together, and sought to prevent discrimination.  According to a <i>Financial Times</i> interview and briefing on 3 February by Sir Patrick Mayhew, his recommendations to the parties were to include proposals for a number of cross-Border executive bodies with responsibility for such areas as tourism and the environment.  Such institutions are exactly in line with the spirit of the Government of Ireland Act.</P>
    <P>If Nationalists are being asked in the declaration for some time into the future to respect the wishes of a greater number of the people in Northern Ireland to remain in the Union, we are entitled to seek implementation of the other balancing compromises contained in the Government of Ireland Act.</P>
    <P>The Joint Peace Declaration goes a considerable distance towards re-establishing the spirit of the original compromise. The declaration contains explicit recognition of the right to self-determination of the Irish people for the first time and disclaims any selfish British strategic or economic interest.  There is also a strong commitment by the British Government to work for an agreed Ireland, including the creation of institutions and structures enabling people, North and South to work together in all areas of common interest.  Our position is that such institutions and structures would need to have at least the scope and powers envisaged in the 1920 Act.</P>
    <P>The declaration is also based on full respect for the civil rights, religious liberties and identities of both traditions in Ireland, the more important of which are spelt out at the end of paragraph 5.  This, too, would be in keeping with the 1920 Act.  My next point would be that in the declaration we have already made substantial progress, following our decision to put the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, on the table, towards reinstating the principles contained in it designed to <Col N="6" /> offset partially the impact of partition, while it lasts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question on the International Fund for Ireland, the position is that the 1994 allocation of $19.6 million is already agreed but the provision for 1995 has yet to be determined. It should be borne in mind that the US budgetary process for that year has only just got under way, and that the proposed $15 million contribution to the IFI represents the US Administration's provisional allocation set out in a draft budgetary paper presented to Congress. This has yet to be processed through the relevant committees and Congress itself. I have already taken up this matter with the White House, and I am hopeful of an early and positive result, but I will, of course, use every appropriate opportunity during my vist to convey the importance of at least maintaining the present level of funding to the IFI in the context of the widespread desire in the United States to assist the advancement of the peace process.</P>
    <P>On the overall question of IFI funding, I am pleased to note that the European Commission proposed last week to continue European Union support for the International Fund for Ireland to the tune of 45 million Ecus for the three year period 1995 to 1997.  The proposals will now go to the EU Council of Ministers for approval, from which I also expect a positive result.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Will he accept that there is a political vacuum in Northern Ireland, that the Downing Street Declaration has not been successful to date in securing the agreement of Sinn Féin and the IRA for a cessation of violence and that in the absence of this peace dividend the Official Unionist Party has retreated into its internal settlement shell?  In these circumstances will he accept there is a need to maintain the momentum and that it is necessary to adopt a new approach?  The case for a Dáil commission has been made by Deputy Bruton but this has been rejected by the Government.  Will the Taoiseach <Col N="7" /> accept there is a need to adopt a new approach and that both Governments should now agree to new proposals covering the three sets of relationships to which he referred, internally, between North and South and the two islands, to be presented to the parties later this year? Will he also accept that the challenge now is to produce joint proposals acceptable to the moderate majority in Northern Ireland?</P>
      <P>On the question of the International Fund for Ireland, will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to indicate to President Clinton that this is the wrong time to reduce the fund by cutting it from $20 million to $15 million and that this cut should be reversed?  I appreciate that the select committee is a matter for the House of Commons and that it is not of great concern unless it is a step towards integration.  However, will the Taoiseach agree that by having only one member of the Nationalist community on the select committee it is unbalanced?  Can a case be made in favour of raising that issue with the United Kingdom authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views known on the question of the establishment of a select committee in the House of Commons, it is a matter for the House of Commons.  At the recent meeting in Downing Street I reiterated my view that the British Government should always be cognisant of the fact that there is a suspicion among the Nationalist community that their views, rights and identity are not fully recognised by the British Government and a fear that the British Government is not behind the Joint Declaration.  The British Prime Minister, John Major, made it abundantly clear to me &mdash; and later to the press &mdash; that he fully subscribed to and stood behind the Joint Declaration. He has taken many opportunities since to reiterate the view of the British and Irish Governments, that the starting point for the talks will be the Downing Street Joint Declaration, that both Governments are committed to the three strand talks process and that it is regrettable <Col N="8" /> the new strategy of the Unionists is to move away, temporarily or otherwise, from this process.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister and I made it clear that we do not subscribe to a one strand talks process for an internal settlement, recognising that this has not worked in the past.  The British Government stated on many occasions that there will be no return to the domination of a Stormont-type government in Northern Ireland and that any system of devolved government will have to enjoy the support and allegiance of both communities. We are committed to a resumption of the talks process.  Provision is made in the Downing Street Joint Declaration for the establishment of a forum for peace and reconciliation &mdash; which would be open to all parties &mdash; to commence the process of reconciliation of the divided communities on this island.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has already held one hearing, if not more, on the position in Northern Ireland.  This objective and strategies will be pursued at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference next week.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that there are great dangers in allowing a political vacuum to exist in Northern Ireland and that in the run up to the European elections and the marching season both Governments should try to adopt detailed joint proposals on the three strand talks process to which he referred to be presented to the political parties later this year?  Does he agree this is the best way to fill the political vacuum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there is a political vacuum.  Both Governments are actively engaged behind the scenes. Mr. Michael Ancram is engaged in bilateral talks, last Saturday the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs had a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland while the Anglo-Irish <Col N="9" /> Conference is due to meet next week. The liaison committee which operates under both Governments is back in action.  There is no question of a political vacuum.  It is hoped that all parties will be able to come to the table because it is by discussion and dialogue that an agreed future for the island of Ireland and accommodation between the two communities will be worked out.  It will never be worked out by a continuance of violence between the two communities. I stressed that on a number of occasions and that is still my strong view.  There is now an historic opportunity for everybody on the island to work out an accommodation for the future and it would be in the spirit of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to which I have referred extensively today, to proceed along the road envisaged as far back as 70 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is desirable that the three-stranded talks involving the political parties in Northern Ireland be resumed quickly so that people do not say things during the European election campaign in Northern Ireland that will make the resumption of political progress after the election more difficult?  What specifically is the Government doing to overcome the obstacles to the resumption of the three-stranded talks?  Is it the case that the Irish Government has not to date submitted any paper to the British Government on strand 1, strand 2 or strand 3?  If so, would the Taoiseach agree that that omission should be remedied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is highly desirable that the talks process should resume and hope it will as soon as possible. We are all political realists and know that things can be said during election campaigns, North or South, that might not be said in a different atmosphere. The talks process continued right through what is regarded as the marching season in 1992.  Although one would hope and expect that it would be possible to resume the talks process quickly, we must be realistic and listen to what other parties <Col N="10" /> say about the resumption of those talks. There is no point in dwelling on a strand 1 talks process that will not endure or yield a result.  Nobody in this House would advocate such a course and the Government is certainly not contemplating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Government has not to date submitted any paper to the British Government in regard to strand 1, strand 2 or strand 3 of the talks?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the absence of any paper creates an impression that the Irish Government does not take the resumption of the talks as seriously as it ought?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the view of some, but it is not the view of either Government.  We have had extensive discussions about the matter the Deputy refers to and we agreed at our last meeting in Downing Street that we would approach matters by first resuming the liaison group between the two Governments. That is the position to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see any role for a devolved power-sharing executive in finding a political solution in Northern Ireland?  Is he still optimistic that there will be a positive response from the Republican movement to the Joint Declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope there will be a positive response.  In a practical analysis of the Joint Declaration and the opportunities it can open up, set against the continuation of futile violence for another 25 years with the taking of more innocent lives, any sensible person would have to come down on the side of a cessation of violence and pursue the legitimate political objectives of the Nationalist community within the forum of political dialogue and the political process. That is my honest opinion, and I am still cautiously hopeful that there will be a positive response and that there will be a cessation of violence in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> On the question of a power-sharing executive, the problems of Northern Ireland cannot be solved in isolation.  The three strands must be taken together. Trying to solve the problems by means of a power-sharing executive simply will not work without working out the relationships between North and South and between the peoples on the island as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that he is now virtually the only person in this country that has any optimism, cautious or otherwise, that the Republican movement will accept the declaration?  The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is a dubious basis for making progress.  That Act was framed specifically in the context of this State being within the Commonwealth but we are no longer in the Commonwealth and now have a Constitution of our own.  The 1920 Act has been amended a number of times, particularly in relation to giving the people of Northern Ireland the right to opt out of the United Kingdom if they wish.  Will the Taoiseach, therefore, agree that it would make far more sense if he would accept that the two States exist and that it is on that basis that negotiations should proceed, not on the basis of a Government of Ireland Act which, in many respects, resulted in a civil war in this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are looking for a balanced constitutional settlement then, of necessity, we must look at the two positions.  I have from the start stated my belief that the Government of Ireland Act and Articles 2 and 3 must be on the table together and not one in isolation from the others.  I do not accept Deputy De Rossa's contention that we can walk <Col N="12" /> away and forget about the objectives of the Government of Ireland Act.  In the Act and the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum it was quite clear that the British Government of the day saw the eventual unity of Ireland, which would start by ensuring good economic co-operation between North and South and setting up institutions to administer the three or four areas that I instanced.  They were the views of the British Government when it put together the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  It is true that certain parts of it have been superseded but that does not negative the fundamental principles laid out then and that is the basis on which I started my talks with the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach's emphasis on the necessity for balance but I find it somewhat surprising that he has drawn attention to certain aspects of the Government of Ireland Act.  The Taoiseach agreed that section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 was responsible for the suspension of Stormont, yet in the previous 50 years it remained a dead letter because of a convention that grew up that the British Government would not interfere within Northern Ireland, and that is an important part of the British constitution that should not be ignored.  On the Taoiseach's comments on section 5 of the Government of Ireland Act relating to the banning of religious discrimination, could anyone in their right mind suggest that throughout the history of Northern Ireland this remained anything other than a dead letter?  It did not refer to housing, jobs or any of the things important <Col N="13" /> to ordinary people.  Finally, in regard to the Council of Ireland, will the Taoiseach remember that although the Council of Ireland was proposed by the Government of Ireland Act and the Unionists actually appointed members to that Council, it was the Government in this part of the island which was responsible for the strangulation of that body because it saw no future in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy that section 5 of the Government of Ireland Act was a dead letter.  What caused the problems was the denial of the rights of the Nationalists and that they were made into second-class citizens.  The domination of one community over the other eventually resulted in the suspension of Stormont&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should recognise the facts.  In paragraph 5 of the Joint Declaration we carried through some of those objectives, but if we revert to a Stormont-like Government, that is what we can expect.  That is not acceptable, it did not work in the past and will not in the future.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which preserves for the Westminister Parliament overall responsibility for Northern Ireland, is the Taoiseach suggesting that in the context of any change while Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom that there should be a diminution in the authority of Westminister over Northern Ireland?  Is he suggesting that there should be a watering down or a sharing of authority in respect of Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are matters for negotiation.  On section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 the British Government does not have a written constitution like us.  The partitioning of Ireland draws its legal basis from that Act.  If we are to seek a balanced constitutional settlement it follows that we should consider the two bases of the Constitution, that in respect of Britain and Northern Ireland and Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.  That is what I said and it should be clear to everybody.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is noteworthy that in his long answer he has not identified a single phrase in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 which he proposes should be changed immediately?  Furthermore, is he aware of the risks in a matter of this complexity of attempting to return to the constitutional fundaments of the issue and seek to reach agreement on the basis <Col N="15" /> that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed on matters about which there are profound &mdash; almost theological &mdash; differences between people on this island? Will the Taoiseach agree that the risk of this &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; approach he is adopting is that no progress will be made because there will be a few remaining issues on which agreement will not be possible?  There is a downside to the approach being adopted by the Taoiseach; it is similar to building a house by starting with the roof rather than the foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Report number 3 of the National Economic and Social Forum recommended that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... a substantial means disregard should be introduced into the current carer's allowance so that this allowance can genuinely become a supplement to support the work of the carer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report referred to the effect of the means test on the amount of the carer's allowance in cases where the spouse of the carer was employed and it pointed out that no carer's allowance was payable where the working spouse was earning more than £120 per week.</P>
      <P>The social welfare Bill which is before the House at present provides for the introduction of a significant improvement in the carer's allowance.  I am particularly pleased to be able to provide in the Bill an earnings disregard of £100 per week in respect of working spouses with effect from next July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means, for example, that a carer whose spouse has earnings of £160 a week and who is not, therefore, entitled to any allowance at present, will receive a weekly carer's allowance of £34 a week from next July.  In terms of numbers, this improvement in the means test <Col N="20" /> means that an extra 500 full-time carers will qualify for the allowance while a further 350 existing carers will get an increase in their weekly payment.</P>
    <P>Carers will also benefit from the general 3 per cent increase in weekly payments which will bring the basic allowance to £61 per week.  In addition, the initial £2 means disregard for entitlement to the full allowance is being increased to £6 a week.  Furthermore, a pensioner being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance will, in future, retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance where previously it would have been discontinued because the living alone condition would no longer have been satisfied.</P>
    <P>At the end of December 1993, allowances were being paid to 4,748 carers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that of nearly 50,000 applicants for the carer's allowance less than 10 per cent received it?  Will he not also agree that elderly people are being forced into institutional care because of the inadequacy of the three existing schemes, namely, the carer's allowance scheme, the nursing home subvention scheme and the home help scheme which is basically a slave labour scheme?  Under that scheme many women are being paid £2 per week and some of those women are present in the Gallery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to introduce a scheme which will empower people dependent on the carer's allowance by paying the allownace to the person cared for rather than the carer?  Will he extend the definition of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was introduced to give the carer an allowance. This matter was debated in the House at length.  It would be a major change to revert to the old system of giving the allowance to the person being cared for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> The total number of applicants refused the allowance was 5,034.  Of that number 38 per cent were refused because their means, including any social welfare payments, exceeded the income limit set in the scheme.  In 24 per cent of cases people were in receipt of social welfare payments. In 38 per cent of cases the principal reason for refusing the allowance was that their means included additional income.  In many cases the other spouse was in receipt of income.  In the budget we have made special provision for that group of carers and we will consider if the scheme can be improved further in the future.  A number of important improvements are currently being made. The scheme is an important one and I accept the Deputy's point in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider with his colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, a co-ordinated approach to the issue of carers and bring forward a scheme combining the concept of institutionalisation and that of caring? The Minister evaded my first question. How many applications were renewed for the carer's allowance?  Will the Minister consider a combination of a carer's scheme and an allowance for those receiving care to provide empowerment for the handicapped?</P>

      <P>It could not be that figure. The Deputy is referring to the total number of people who might be caring in one form or another.  I have given the Deputy the number of people who have been refused the carer's allowance and the grounds on which their applications were rejected.  Twenty-seven per cent of applicants were refused because they were in employment.  The Deputy would have to table a question to obtain information in respect of the total number of applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on social welfare income maintenance, the person <Col N="23" /> who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support. The provisions of Part 9 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 allow for the transfer to my Department of all court maintenance received by a claimant, including maintenance paid to children, to offset their spouse's liability.</P>
    <P>In situations where the family is adequately maintained by the liable relative, that is where the maintenance, which may relate to both the claimant and dependent children, exceeds the maximum rate of deserted wife's benefit or lone parent's allowance appropriate to the family size, then my Department is not involved in income support. However, if the level of maintenance is inadequate or no maintenance is paid to the family, my Department supports the family through the appropriate income support scheme.</P>
    <P>When a deserted wife is awarded deserted wife's benefit, then her spouse becomes liable to contribute to my Department towards that benefit.  Where that spouse is paying maintenance on foot of a court order, that order must be transferred to my Department to offset his liability.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind this measure is that my Department guarantees the lone parent a regular weekly payment and recovers some of the cost from the liable relative, including payments he makes in compliance with a court maintenance order.  A woman on deserted wife's benefit with three children will receive from July next £64.50 plus £17 for each child, that is a total of £115.50 per week.  This is the same payment as applies in the case of a widow.</P>
    <P>If the liable relative defaults on court maintenance payments subsequently my Department can take action under social welfare legislation.  This removes the onus on deserted or separated spouses to have to seek court enforcement under family law themselves where they are not receiving maintenance regularly.</P>
    <P>Since the legislation was introduced in November, 1990 my Department has <Col N="24" /> concentrated on identifying whether there is a liable relative and whether he or she is in a position to pay a contribution. At the end of this process existing recipients of deserted wife's benefit or allowance or lone parent's allowance may be requested to transfer their maintenance payments to the Department.  In all cases the Department seeks transfer of maintenance payments from a current date only.  In no case are any arrears of maintenance sought from the lone parent.  Where such transfer of maintenance takes place in the case of a person receiving a lone parent's allowance, their rate of weekly allowance is adjusted upwards to reflect the loss of means through maintenance.</P>
    <P>All new applicants for lone parents or deserted wife's payment are made aware from the outset that if their claim is successful any court maintenance payments which they are in receipt of will be transferable to the Department.  They are guaranteed their maximum weekly benefit or allowance entitlement in that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>How many husbands have been brought into the net as a result of the introduction of this provision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's earlier response will be very disappointing for families.  In practice women and children are receiving ultimatums from the Minister's Department to sign away their maintenance payments or have their deserted wife's benefit reduced accordingly. Does the Minister recognise the hardship this will impose on the families concerned and will he introduce a transition system so that payments will not be reduced from £120 to £65 in one week? Will the Minister agree that this proposal will cause severe hardship to families who cannot afford such a sudden reduction in payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is based on a guarantee.  I was very much involved in <Col N="25" /> its introduction which was suggested by Deputies as a result of their experiences. Many people were without proper payment and the conditions were such that they could not get deserted wife's benefit or lone parent's allowance.  Legislation was introduced to guarantee that people in those circumstances would receive payment equal to a widow's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They are social insurance based entitlements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That guarantee is set down in legislation.  The Department makes very clear to anyone seeking the guarantee that the maintenance order will be transferable.  Obviously, if the amount of maintenance paid is greater than, for instance, deserted wife's benefit, that payment will arise.  In so far as there may be existing cases where an order has been made, I will consider the transitional arrangement suggested by the Deputy. The legislation is very clear and the purpose and intent of the House in passing it was that a deserted wife should not be forced into having to go back to court to get even part of the maintenance due. The legislation provides that the Department would take that action on her behalf where necessary and in the meantime would give her a guarantee of a payment equal to that made to widows.  I wish to make clear the position and what is in the legislation.  I will consider the Deputy's proposal in the context of existing cases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's acknowledgment that the regulations cause severe hardship to families.  Does the Minister agree that this provision is a further attack on the social insurance based system?  What people are getting is not charity, but an entitlement.  This provision is akin to the attempt to means test widow's pension and the Minister should reverse it immediately.  It is a serious attack on women and children who, through no fault of their own, are experiencing hard times.</P>

      <P>Full social insurance cover will apply to all new public sector employees recruited on or after 6 April 1995.  This will end the system whereby certain public servants were insured only for widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wife's benefit and will close off a major gap in the coverage of the social insurance system.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that public servants should be liable for the standard rate of PRSI and felt that this step would improve the sense of social solidarity within the social welfare system and facilitate the mobility of public servants both within the public sector and between the private and public sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement told the House that the new recruits will have full PRSI cover, and their occupational sick pay and pension schemes will be amended to take account of their entitlement to the full range of social welfare benefits.  Staff interests will <Col N="27" /> be fully consulted as regards the amended conditions of employment, which will be in accordance with the arrangements applicable to other groups of public servants &mdash; comprising a large proportion of the public sector workforce &mdash; who already have a class A PRSI status.</P>
    <P>The Minister further told the House that following a comprehensive examination, and earlier consultations with the management of affected State companies, the Government has concluded that the application of full PRSI cover to all serving staff in modified public sector employments would not be justified.  The move is in line with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>How many new civil servants will be recruited in the next year and what will the implications be in terms of PRSI payments?  Has the Department undertaken an indepth examination of this matter and what are its views on extending PRSI payments to those already employed in the Civil Service?  With greater life expectancy the number of old aged pensioners will increase substantially and there will be a greater requirement for pension provision.  Is there any thinking on this matter or is it being ignored by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been considered for a number of years.  As the pension system is developed everybody should be covered.  Discussions on this question have taken place and as a result it is proposed that new entrants to the public service will pay full social insurance.  <i>Pro rata</i> payments and other arrangements still apply to those working part-time in the Civil Service.  These matters will be considered further in the context of the National Pension Board's report to see in what way people who are missing out on cover can be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision has been taken to apply full social insurance cover to all new entrants to the public sector from 6 April 1995. This will have a substantial impact in <Col N="28" /> the longer term in terms of ensuring a balance in pension provision.  Most concerns about pension provision in, for example, the year 2032 will obviously be eliminated by the broader contribution base.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme is administered by the eight regional health boards on behalf of my Department.  Unlike other schemes, it contains a number of discretionary elements which are without prerequisites for a scheme which must be flexible and responsive to immediate needs.  The combination of discretion and <Col N="29" /> the fact that the scheme is administered by separate health boards are factors which have contributed to certain inconsistencies in the operation of the scheme. I have acknowledged that these need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance service can be improved significantly by standardising the application process for supplementary welfare allowance payments. This would involve the introduction of a common application form for all supplementary welfare applications in all health boards and the provision of better information to clients on the reasons for a board's decision.</P>
      <P>I have established an advisory group under the chairmanship of my Department which includes representatives from all health boards to examine aspects of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The group has been asked to consider the design of such a form and will consider also the information and appeal requirements.</P>
      <P>A review of the supplementary welfare allowance appeal system is also under way in my Department and, when concluded, it is my intention to set down certain criteria for the operation of appeals under the scheme.  These initiatives will improve consistency and transparency in the operation of the scheme and will ensure equitable treatment for all applicants.</P>

Approximately 100 women who cannot get information from his Department on their entitlements marched outside the gates of Leinster House today.  Will the Minister undertake a review of the workings of his Department and the health boards in terms of the serious lack of information given to people about their entitlements?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department. Following discussions in the House, I made it clear that I would set up an advisory group to look at the operation of the scheme.  I will try to make the scheme as uniform as possible bearing in mind the need for some discretion in its operation.  This will include the standardisation of application forms, the provision of more information on decisions and an examination of the appeals system.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the appeals system for supplementary welfare applicants is not independent as it is operated within the Eastern Health Board?  How soon does the Minister expect the advisory group to report on the appeals procedure for applicants for supplementary welfare allowance?  Is it intended in the meantime to ensure that all people refused assistance by community welfare officers are informed of their right to appeal?  Most applicants are not informed of that right. Will he ensure that the appeal form is simple so that applicants can pursue what they regard as their right and that appeals under this system are dealt with speedily? This system is intended to assist people in dire need, it is a safety net, and it is surely not in the spirit of its provision that people should have to wait months for the result of an appeal.</P>

      <P>As I implied in my initial reply, I am not happy with the operation <Col N="31" /> of the appeals system.  I am having the matter looked at and will come back to the House on it as soon as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has taken an interest in this matter and the Combat Poverty Agency has issued some reports on it.  The Deputy referred to the need for speed when dealing with appeals.  I am looking at the integration of decisions.  The computerisation of the system, which should be completed in one year's time, will bring about very substantial changes.  The problems referred to by the Deputy are being dealt with.  As he probably knows, the amount of information provided varies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister prefer to see the entire supplementary welfare allowance scheme brought within the remit of the Department of Social Welfare so that the Department of Health is taken out of the equation altogether? The duplication in the operation of the scheme confuses applicants and gives rise to inconsistency.  It is enough that this very marginalised group of people should have to deal with one Department without having to deal with two of them.  The Minister should bring about a change whereby the supplementary welfare scheme will be operated by the local Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing the basis now for the closer integration of our schemes with this scheme.  Whether it should be operated directly by the Department of Social Welfare is dependent on the particular areas.  In some <Col N="32" /> areas, for instance, it might fit in well; it may work in the one stop shop arrangement provided the administrative arrangements are in place.  We ensured that as many interim payments as possible were cut out and the question of the Department taking over interim payments directly is very much to the fore. As Deputies are aware, there will always be a discretionary element in this matter and the supplementary welfare officer must exercise that discretion.</P>

      <P>There is no necessity to wait for at least a year until the computerisation is completed or indeed until the whole supplementary welfare allowance system is revised before indicating to community welfare officers that they must inform applicants who are refused the allowance that they have the right to appeal.  The Minister should have a simple appeal form drafted which would include the name and address of the person to whom an appeal should be sent and sufficient space for a person to state the basis for the appeal.  These are two simple matters and it is unnecessary to wait for the outcome of computerisation or a review of the whole scheme. It is simply indicating people's rights to them.</P>

I said already that we hope to issue an explanatory leaflet on the appeals process to people seeking supplementary welfare.  They will then know they have the right to appeal.  Earlier, I referred to my concern in a broader way about the whole system but we are currently discussing how to improve the provision of information and proper follow up in terms of advising people of their rights, etc.  As I said to Deputy De Rossa, that will be followed up further by the provision of explanatory information.</P>

      <P>The current payment of £5 per week, which is payable to eligible households from mid-October to mid-April, has been in operation since 1985.</P>
      <P>In 1990 I introduced an allowance of £3 per week, which is payable in addition to the fuel allowance, in recognition of the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The variations in domestic fuel costs year on year are identified separately in the consumer price index which is produced by the Central Statistics Office. The fuel and light component of this index shows that between August 1985 and August 1993 fuel costs have increased by 4.7 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister accept that the £5 fuel voucher, of considerable benefit in 1988, would have its value reduced to £2.50, £3 maximum, as a result of inflation and the increased cost of fuel in the meantime?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The change in terms of the value and cost of fuel has been relatively <Col N="37" /> small over the period partly because prices fell although they have risen recently.  It will be kept under review since it is a very substantial scheme covering a large number of people and is considered in the preparation of the budget every year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I think I detected a blush of embarrassment on the Minister's face endeavouring to defend keeping the allowance at the same level whereas old people who need that fuel badly must pay, admittedly not an exorbitant increase in the cost of fuel.  When inflation is taken into account, one readily realises that the scheme's value has been more than halved.  While I criticised the 3 per cent before as being useless, since it was merely keeping pace with inflation, surely the least that should be done is to take into account increases in the rate of inflation?  The £5 could be raised to perhaps £7 which would help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not want to advance this argument from a scientific viewpoint but, in view of the very obvious change in weather patterns over recent years, will the Minister consider making the allowance available to recipients a fortnight earlier and leaving it in place for a fortnight later until, say, the middle of April or thereabouts?  It would be of enormous benefit, particularly to the elderly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the elderly are concerned, at budget time the principal concentration is on increasing payments and benefits.  As the Deputy knows, that is what has been done in the most recent budget, resulting in payments to them above the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Because of the small variations in fuel prices overall the allowances have remained fairly static over the period concerned and they are based on the figures I gave the Deputy.  The estimated total expenditure <Col N="39" /> on the national fuel scheme in 1994 is £39.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the £5 voucher would not even buy a bag of coal for recipients?  It might buy a bag of wooden blocks.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will have to be considered within the context of the budget.  Since 1985 the scope of the scheme has broadened very considerably, leading to the total expenditure having increased significantly overall, extending the same benefits to many more people which has necessitated the extra expenditure on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992, my Department allocated a grant of £10,000 to Rural Resettlement Ireland under the scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations. No grant was paid in 1993.</P>
      <P>The 1994 scheme was recently advertised in the national papers.  Information on the scheme, together with an application form, has been forwarded to Rural Resettlement Ireland.  It is open to the organisation to apply for a grant in respect of a suitable once-off project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that this is not simply another organisation engaging in social work of a relatively routine nature?  He must be aware that the population of <Col N="40" /> Connacht has fallen by 23 per cent since 1926, that 759 townlands have been totally destroyed and depopulated while, at the same time, the population of Dublin has exploded by 519,000.  Is the Minister aware that Rural Resettlement Ireland, within the relatively short time it has been in existence, has provided resettlement for 130 Dublin families, that 80 houses have been freed up to Dublin Corporation, that there are at present 2,300 families on the waiting list and that it would make a lot of sense to give a decent injection of capital to this organisation to enable it to continue its good work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins it is an important organisation doing very valuable work which has a considerable impact.  Jim Connolly inspired it, he comes from just round the corner from me in Kilbarrack and his father was involved with me in founding the Kilbarrack and District Community Association a good many years ago.  Perhaps, he learned some of his community work in Dublin. This is a once-off scheme and an application form will be forwarded to the Deputy to apply in respect of any project.  I have no doubt the Deputy will be speaking to the person involved.  The fact that this is a once-off grant does not mean the group cannot get a second grant if other facets of their work are worthy of support.</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree that this group is doing important work.  Has any formal evaluation of the work been carried out?  Does the Department intend to encourage an expansion of that work or similar projects in other parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The work mainly relates to the Department of the Environment. The question is about a once-off grant for which the group applied and were granted.  No grant was paid last year.  Due to the nature of the work we would be happy to support the group provided a suitable project was advanced in the current year.  This work has an indirect bearing <Col N="41" /> on the Department of Social Welfare in that it is helping communities develop. The group has not applied for grant assistance under any of the Community development headings and that is one area that should be examined.  The group may wish to examine the position again. It may not have fully understood that the once-off grants can be sought for another project.  Should the group apply it will receive favourable treatment from the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister's positive remarks on the rural resettlement scheme.  Rather than look at this scheme in terms of once-off projects would it be possible to establish criteria under which the group would receive some type of grant-in-aid or support on a year by year basis?  The Minister is aware that many voluntary agencies have difficulty in financing projects because they have no idea what moneys they will receive from year to year.  If an organisation such as the rural resettlement group could be assured of a certain base amount to be established in criteria to be determined by the Minister, it would enhance their work and it would mean that the organisation could expand and continue to provide a very valuable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the group has proposals which would come under the heading of Community development we may be of assistance to it.  Strictly speaking, it is a matter for the group to apply.  We will certainly communicate with the group with the view to ascertaining its position. It would also be eligible for other support particularly in the context of the Leader programme.  We will follow up this case to ascertain what is happening, not only in relation to once-off grants but in relation to its position generally in dealing with groups of disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that instead of having this group on a voluntary basis with some State assistance this should become a main Government activity?  We are talking about huge <Col N="42" /> population imbalances.  For example, there are massive uncontrolled population explosions in one half of the country and decay, depopulation and devastation in the other.  What is needed is a proper mainstream Government activity rather than the group being a fringe voluntary activity as at present.  Is the Minister aware that on the airwaves, courtesy of Gay Byrne's radio programme, this organisation is literally begging for the money to buy a truck for the purpose of transferring furniture from Dublin to settlements in the various counties?  This should be looked at in the context of overall Government social planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This group has been fairly assiduous in pursuing different grants, including grants from the Department of the Environment and once-off grants under the EC Leader programme.  It has received grants of up to £40,000 from the Department of the Environment towards administration costs and up to now it has concentrated mainly on grants from that Department.  The Deputy should tell the group that if Gay Byrne does not have sufficient funds for the lorry it can seek a once-off grant for this purpose.  That is one of the items which is eligible for a once-off grant.  We will not refuse any funds Gay Byrne, or anybody else, puts into the pot because it helps us to spread our money further.  There are several avenues that could be explored.  Certainly, the issue raised in the Deputy's question can be followed up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The principal income maintenance scheme which is available to those people who are unable to work because of illness or disability and are not eligible for contributory benefits is disabled person's maintenance allowance.  This scheme is administered by the health boards.  In the event of a person not being eligible for disabled person's maintenance allowance, they may apply for supplementary welfare allowance which is a weekly allowance payable to people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there is a case for reform in this area.  Such reform would cater for existing disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients and for recipients of supplementary welfare allowance who are unable to work through illness or disability.  I would envisage that a significant step along the way would be made with the transfer of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to the Department of Social Welfare.  The integration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance or infectious disease maintenance allowance into the social welfare system would be a complex matter and would require detailed consideration. I have a number of major developments in hands at present to streamline the administration of social welfare schemes and improve the capacity of my Department's systems. Changes to the systems to accommodate the schemes in question are being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that these schemes should be streamlined. The Minister will agree that there is a great deal of unnecessary duplication which creates difficulty both for the clients involved and health board officials.  It would be desirable if the people involved could be brought together under a new national social assistance scheme for the sick.  Has the Minister a timescale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and I are anxious to see the transfer take place as soon as possible.  One of the first objectives will be to bring in the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme. I am also keen to have a scheme which would provide for those not catered for under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme and who are forced to claim unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance.  That is part of the change I would like to see take place.  We are doing further work on computerising the social welfare system which will result in a better and more streamlined service.  Provision is included in that for the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  We must have discussion with the health boards and make arrangements for any changes that may be made.  It is agreed in principle that will be done.</P>

      <P>How many people qualified for the infectious diseases maintenance allowance in the last financial year?  Will the Minister look at the way in which that scheme is administered by the health boards?  People who have been diagnosed as suffering from TB are asked to wait in crowded waiting rooms to see community welfare officers and are subsequently quizzed about the nature of their health before a decision is made on the allowance. Would the Minister agree there is urgent need to review the working of the scheme and the manner in which people are subjected to questioning about their health?  Will he issue one of his famous circulars to ensure that people who have an infectious disease get the entitlements they are due and do not have to claim <Col N="45" /> under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme?</P>

Will he employ temporary staff to work on Saturdays and Sundays so as to ensure prompt payment to farmers as the delays are causing resentment and hardship, which if allowed to develop will lead to public riots?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill on International Women's Day, as this legislation is another milestone in attaining rights and equality for women.  It has taken a long time to tackle the question of family law reform.  It is 150 years since the last major Act dealing with marriage was introduced in 1844.  We are notoriously slow in keeping pace with changes in family life, particularly with regard to marriage and child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first Government in the history of the State which has taken the question of law reform and equality <Col N="150" /> seriously.  It was a master stroke to separate criminal law from civil law between the Department of Justice and the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  In years to come the decision to appoint a Minister for Equality and Law Reform will be considered one of the most significant decisions taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>During the three years I was a Member of the Seanad while a plethora of criminal justice Bills were presented not one measure under the heading of civil law reform was introduced.  This underlines the need for a Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Taylor, the first Minister to hold that portfolio.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the package of legislative proposals contained in the Programme for Government under the heading of law reform covering such matters as women's rights and family law.  It is appropriate on International Women's Day to highlight the steps taken to date by the Government: on the question of gender balance, 40 per cent of the members of State boards must be women; legislation has been passed protecting the family home and we are now discussing the Family Law Bill, substantial legislation, which marks a further step towards the proposed divorce referendum due to be held in the autumn. This matter was raised on the Order of Business today.  There is a crying need to introduce a Bill to allow this constitutional referendum and make the required changes.</P>
    <P>Foreign divorces are recognised but people do not have the right to remarry. There is no point denying that marriages break up.  The purpose of the 1989 judicial separation Act was to put a mechanism in place under which the affairs of spouses whose marriages have broken up could be put in order.  That Act contains provisions dealing with children, property and financial matters.  We must also consider the question of what happens to the partnership; we must not confine spouses for an eternity to a relationship which everyone knows no longer exists. This is a mature society which should <Col N="151" /> be reflected in the Constitution and our laws.  We must recognise that if two mature adults have the right to enter into a binding legal contract they also have the right to dissolve that contract and start all over again.</P>
    <P>We cannot avoid this issue because if we do this will remain a stunted society which will be damaging for those compelled to remain within marriages which have broken down, particularly for the children.  It would also damage what we hold sacred in the Constitution, the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the support services he has put in place to protect the institution of marriage.  It is my contention that divorce, instead of damaging it, protects the institution of marriage just as this legislation is intended to protect the family.  Raising the age of marriage from 16 to 18 ensures that youngsters are more mature when they marry and that there is, therefore, a greater likelihood of their partnership enduring.  Making it a requirement to give three month's notice of intention to marry allows people a period of time to reflect on the substance and scale of what they are entering into.  That also is of benefit in ensuring that people enter in the fullness of knowledge into one of the most important relationships in their lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided for a 150 per cent increase in counselling services, a 142 per cent increase in mediation services and a 56 per cent increase in legal aid with the allocation of the Legal Aid Board increased to £5 million.  These are substantial financial increases to support the institution of marriage.  It is when a marriage has broken down irretrievably that we must resort to the courts, but there must be as much intervention as possible to prevent marriages reaching that stage.  An adequately-resourced and adequately-staffed family mediation service is, therefore, an essential plank in helping to maintain stable relationships within marriage.</P>
    <P>There are now 14 new family law centres, almost a doubling of the existing 16. <Col N="152" /> That means every county in Ireland will have access to family law court facilities through the Legal Aid Board.  As well as almost doubling the number of family law centres, a further 24 solicitors will be made available, also an enormous increase.  In addition, 34 additional staff, typists etc. will service the centres. Already the queues have been reduced enormously and, no doubt, in the not too distant future the service will be a fast and efficient one.  All of this is geared to supporting the existing institutions, putting emphasis on reconciliation and the mediation services and, in the last analysis, going to court.  That is the background against which we are discussing this legislation, where the Government is committed to a major overhaul of family law, and is prepared to put its money where its mouth is by providing the necessary resources.  We could talk forever about reform but if we do not provide the funding it is just waffle.</P>
    <P>In this legislation we are bringing our procedures into line with those of our European counterparts.  The courts can, for the first time, make orders following decrees of nullity, foreign decrees of divorce and nullity, and legal separation.  It is important that we recognise what is happening in other countries and regulate relationships that have been established and terminated abroad.  We are extending Circuit Court jurisdiction which will enable a greater number of cases to be dealt with.  The Circuit Court will have jurisdiction specifically over nullity proceedings.  We are extending the power of the court to make declarations about the status of a person's marriage.  We are raising the minimum age of marriage to 18 and providing that three month's notice of marriage be given, and the law relating to maintenance is being strengthened.</P>
    <P>There has not been a major overhaul of family law for 150 years.  We have been picking at this issue for up to 20 years. The report on the law of nullity in Ireland was produced by the Attorney General as far back as 1976.  We have had a variety of reports both domestically and internationally since then.  There was the Law <Col N="153" /> Reform Commission report of 1983 on the age of majority and of marriage and we are only dealing with that now, 11 years on.  We are only now dealing, too, with the question of proceedings for nullity though it is almost ten years since we had the report on recognition of foreign nullity decrees.  We have also had The Hague Convention on recognition of validity of marriages, the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, the report of the Combat Poverty Agency on the financial consequences of marriage breakdown and, more recently, the initiative taken by the previous Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey in 1991 when he made an announcement to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that he would introduce a White Paper on marriage breakdown.  The then Minister for Justice, Mr. Flynn, produced that White Paper in 1992.  That plethora of reports and recommendations has finally been drawn together in this legislative package.  It is good to see the matter being dealt with rather than merely reports being produced and left to gather dust.  That is why I am particularly glad to be able to compliment the Minister today.</P>
    <P>This legislation was initially proposed in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is a step on the way to a divorce referendum and provides safeguards for those who are married and for those whose marriages are breaking up. Up to now decrees of nullity were available only through the High Court, but under the provisions of this legislation they will be available through the Circuit Court which is more accessible to ordinary citizens.  Also, up to now the courts did not have power to make financial or property arrangements or support regulations in the case of annulment.  An annulment means that the marriage did not exist in the first place, but the considerations &mdash; children, property, etc &mdash; for a couple in such a union are likely to be the same as for a couple in a valid marriage.  By taking the view that because a marriage was null and void no such problems would arise, we were turning a blind eye to the real issue. <Col N="154" /> Under this legislation the question of nullity will be dealt with in a similar manner to that of judicial separation.  We are providing for barring, protection, custody and maintenance orders and for the protection of the family home and contents.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this legislation in respect of attachment of earnings by the courts when a spouse has been in default in the matter of contributions are infinitely superior to the measures which apply at present.  Statistics indicate that approximately double the level of payments is achieved once an attachment of earnings order is provided for.</P>
    <P>This is significant legislation but I do not have time to deal with all the sections. I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the age of marriage from 16 to 18 years.  Couples are biologically capable of procreation at the age of 16, but boys and girls of that age are still in their youth. They are in their mid-teens, in most cases have completed their junior certificate and are not fully grown mature adults. They are in the process of exploring life and not in a position to make long term lifelong decisions.  Eighteen is the age of majority and the age at which people are entitled to vote and I compliment the Minister for increasing the legal age of marriage to 18.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister for introducing it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Taylor, for introducing this Bill, but like other Members I have some concerns in regard to it.  We cannot but notice that this Minister is being watched carefully by many groups and individuals and that the legislation he introduces is being carefully scrutinised.  We are assured that one of those scrutineers is the office of the Attorney General, but I must remind the Minister that the opinion of that office did not coincide with the opinion of the Supreme Court in respect of recent legislation, namely, the Matrimonial Home Bill.  As a result the time spent debating that legislation both here and in the Seanad was wasted.  There is no doubt <Col N="155" /> that those who are scrutinising the Minister's moves, including the introduction of this legislation, will seek to have this Bill referred to the Supreme Court when it is passed through the Oireachtas.  If the Bill is not referred to the Supreme Court it is likely that its constitutionality will be challenged at a later date.</P>
      <P>The contents of the Bill are comprehensive and intricate.  The Minister described it as one of the most extensive family law measures to come before the House.  It is likely to take up much time and effort on the part of Members of this House, particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to abuse the privilege of this House by making unfair allegations, I would like to place on record my concern with the legal advice the Minister has been receiving.  I do not wish to unfairly criticise the Attorney General, but his advice to the Government on the last occasion was wrong.  As it is likely that similar questions will be raised about the constitutionality of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, it is not in order to reflect on an officer of the Government.  If serious charges are to be made against the Attorney General it should be done by way of substantive motion rather than by making comments here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to do so.  I am merely issuing a word of caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister will reassure and convince us that the work and effort we will put into this Bill will be useful and that it will not be overturned by the courts.  Such a turn of events would be unfortunate for a number of reasons.  It would mean that many valuable hours of this House's debating time would have been wasted.  More importantly, it would mean that the Government would introduce divorce legislation in the autumn minus an important chink in the armour that could protect the rights of the separating parties.  We have yet to see the Government's proposals for divorce legislation, but the chances of those proposals <Col N="156" /> being just and equitable would be severely impaired if this Bill was declared unconstitutional In short, if the Bill is passed, it must be capable of withstanding any challenge to its constitutionality. We need more reassurances from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that his legal advice is authoritative and reliable.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to consult as widely as possible among constitutional and family lawyers so that any necessary amendments may be made on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, even if one line of the Bill is found to be repugnant to the Constitution the entire Bill is lost.  While I have some reservations about the Bill, it would be tragic if divorce legislation was passed in the Oireachtas and accepted by the people without the backup of legislation such as this.  It would also be tragic if in this, the year of the family, we lifted the ban on divorce without the measures and provisions of this Bill being implemented, measures and conditions designed to minimise the hardship of the less well off partner and the children in the sad event of a marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>That would surely offend against the spirit of the Constitution even if the ban on divorce is lifted by will of the people. It would be unfortunate if the law provided for the dissolution of marriages without making adequate provision for the fair treatment of the less well off partner.  Such a scenario would, without doubt, seriously undermine the family and the family status as &ldquo;the natural primary and fundamental group of society&rdquo; as defined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>During our deliberations on this legislation we must recognise that if separation of spouses, whether by way of annulment or dissolution of a marriage, is allowed, it will not constitute the annulment or dissolution of the family.  We all know it alters the family but it does not dissolve it and, regardless of the steps taken, the family must be protected.  The Bill goes a long way towards providing that protection and I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <P>A number of sections in the Bill are <Col N="157" /> particularly welcome.  Perhaps the least controversial and complicated provision is the Minister's decision to raise the age of consent of marriage to 18 years for both partners.  In an era of an increasing incidence of marriage breakdown it is important that couples do not rush into marriage too young or too quickly.  The provision for three months' notice of intent to marry is welcome.  Too often young couples rushed to the altar without a proper and realistic understanding of marriage and it has turned out to be a serious mistake with couples not giving themselves sufficient time to fully evaluate their relationship and commitment to one another.  Even today couples feel they are trapped into marriage by a pregnancy, pressure from parents and relatives and the need to keep up appearances.  Such circumstances make a strong case for nullity in that the partners married without full consent.  I welcome the provision for a period of three months from the time of notification of intent to marry to the time of marriage.  Some Churches have made that provision a requirement for some time and it is strongly recommended by many psychologists and marriage counsellors.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy McManus's earlier contribution in respect of this point, she stated that the requirements to be 18 years old and to give three months' notice of intent to marry were alien to the travelling community and that they would enforce a cultural change on travellers. Deputy McManus is aware of the traditions and culture of the travelling people from her work as chairperson of the task force on the travelling community and I urge the Minister to take her remarks into account.</P>
    <P>I note the 18 years and three months' waiting period requirements can be avoided by making application to the court.  It is a good idea to recognise that sometimes extenuating circumstances make the three months' notice too long but I have reservations in that regard as I am afraid that this provision could become the norm.  Unless there is a clear definition of extenuating circumstances <Col N="158" /> this provision could defeat the aim of the three month's notice provision, namely, to prevent people getting married without due consideration.  Will the Minister clarify what the court will interpret as &ldquo;serious reasons&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>This Bill is also vague as to how the application for dispensation will be made.  Paragraph 33 states that the application may be made informally.  I do not understand how one makes an informal application for a Circuit Court order and I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.  I have visions of engaged couples tapping the county registrar on the shoulder as he eats his lunch and asking him if they can be exempted from the three months' rule.  The idea of him fixing an early morning appointment so that their case can be heard privately is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the idea of informality in respect of cases heard in camera would help to make the process user friendly and less traumatic.  However, this facility, even though it may be essential and helpful to a small number of couples, will be available only to those with the means to pay for legal representation.  It seems unfair that a measure designed to help groups, such as the travellers, to preserve their traditions and culture will not be available to them because of the cost of engaging counsel.  It would be quicker to give the registrar the required three months' notice and then marry rather than having to sign for free legal aid and applying for the three months' period to be waived.  The process of gaining a dispensation from the court would take longer than three months and this measure is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Section 5 which provides for the requirements of 18 years and three months' period should be the least controversial and the most readily understood by the non-legally trained reader, but it is causing much confusion.  The lack of clarity is worrying and makes one want to shrink from examining the more complex sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions.  The Bill is comprehensive in granting to the court powers to order either partner, even in the case of nullity, to pay for the <Col N="159" /> maintenance of the other.  I welcome the variety of options open to the courts, such as lump sums, periodic payments, attachment of earnings and soon.  It is interesting that we are debating this Bill on International Women's Day.  I have already criticised the Minister for not letting this important day become a valuable marker and a special day for all women. I had hoped that the Minister might have made an interesting statement on behalf of women in respect of the payment of their arrears or increasing the lot of carers.  It is ironic and sad that the first time many women will have heard that today is International Women's Day is through news reports of the visit of the President to the United Nations Headquarters in New York to address the United Nations organised conference to mark women's day.</P>
    <P>While we may not be having either largescale celebrations or conferences here to mark International Women's Day, we are doing something in this House which will make a positive impact on the lives of many women, particularly those who have suffered marriage breakdown. Women are usually poorer when couples separate.  While we cannot legislate for ways to prevent the terrible personal, psychological trauma suffered by a woman when her marriage breaks up, at least we can do our best through this legislation to ensure that when a couple split up, neither will be suddenly impoverished or destitute.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, said:</P>
    <P>One of the hallmarks of a modern and caring society is one which recognises needs and is prepared to do something about them.  In the context of marital breakdown it means a society with strong support services whether State or voluntary and it means a system of laws which protects spouses and children and which enables justice to be done where necessary.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister on this, but I am frustrated with the Bill as it <Col N="160" /> provides for only one small element of what needs to be done.  While it provides the basic framework on which the courts can base their decisions in cases of separation and nullity and is welcome, there is no provision in it for support services. I cannot accept this Bill alone will prove to be a hallmark of a caring society.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 when the Judicial Separation Act came into force, one in 12 of Irish couples affected by marital breakdown applied for judicial separations similar to the type provided for in this Bill.  It is interesting to note the reactions of different people to the way the system has been working since then.  Lawyers say it is fair and equitable and I have no doubt it is.  However, last week a spokesperson for the lone parents group, Gingerbread, said in <i>The Sunday Tribune:</i></P>
    <P>What we hear from most people who have gone through judicial separations is how horrible and expensive it was.  It is all done in a very adversarial manner and it means that everyone ends up being even more bitter about the whole separation than they would have been.</P>
    <P>The two key words in his observation are &ldquo;horrible&rdquo; and &ldquo;expensive&rdquo;.  Considering the expensive element, it is not difficult to see why bringing an action to court would be expensive.  It involves engaging solicitors and barristers and other experts like auctioneers, bankers, quantity surveyors, pension scheme administrators and many others who all charge fees.  This is a great expense and certainly cannot be afforded by many of the couples who separate.  It is especially crippling for a wife separating from a mean husband, who is caught in the vicious circle of not having enough money to sue him for maintenance.  The waiting lists for free legal aid, coupled with the waiting lists for court applications to be heard, conspire to make this Bill either too expensive or completely inaccessible to many couples.</P>
    <P>The other concern of the spokesperson from Gingerbread was that the process was horrible, that it was too arguementative and confrontational.  There are <Col N="161" /> a number of quotations in the same feature from women who have been through court proceedings and who found the experience deeply impersonal and soul destroying.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to give jurisdiction in this Bill to the Circuit Court to determine and hear proceedings under the Bill.  This should shorten the waiting lists, but the fact still remains that an X <i>versus</i> Y court case will continue to be the pattern.  I would be interested to know it on the one or two days per session that the Circuit Court transforms itself into the Circuit Family Court, the judge and barristers will still use the existing Victorian courtroom and the positively medieval wigs and gowns.  Some flexibility in this regard could go a long way towards making the process less daunting and I hope that the Minister, in collaboration with the Minister for Justice, will take this on board.</P>
    <P>However, this would still be only a modification of the adversarial approach. What we need most urgently is the other half of that coin that the Minister flipped over in his opening speech, that is, strong support services.  In particular I refer to stronger and better funded family mediation services.  Many voluntary and Church groups already provide services such as these where the couple, their solicitors and others such as psychologists and social workers sit down and work out a settlement without having to face one another across a courtroom, with a decision being enforced by a judge and his sheriffs.  Surely this is the way we should be going?  Surely this Bill, valid as it is, should only be a last resort when one partner refuses completely to take responsibility for the other partner and the children?</P>
    <P>By bringing in legislation such as this, without increasing the funding for services such as counselling and mediation, we are forcing people into the courtroom. I strongly urge the Minister, after he has seen this Bill through the House, to get working immediately with his colleagues, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Howlin, to ensure that such support services are put on a firmer footing.  If that <Col N="162" /> is done at least in the case of marriage breakdown, we may be able to upgrade the hallmark of a caring society which the Minister speaks of from 12 carat rolled gold to 24 carat pure gold.  I look forward to that day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for introducing this much needed legislation.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this very important matter which affects many people in society.  As legislators we should show compassion and leadership in cases of marital breakdown.  The Government must not be allowed shirk from its responsibilities in this area, and I believe it will not do so.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government is the blueprint from which the Government will implement its policies and initiatives. It is obvious to anyone who has read this document that it contains a very strong commitment to reform of the law in this area.  The Programme for Government states the Government's commitment to a major programme of family law reform, culminating in a divorce referendum at end 1994.  There are many people in society who believe that this legislation is urgently required.  A practical and caring approach must be taken to law reform in order to give people whose first marriages have failed a second chance.</P>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, this legislation is the first major attempt in more than 150 years to tidy up the whole area of family law.  It is a wide-ranging, comprehensive Bill containing 49 sections.  It is one of the most extensive Bills in this area to be published in recent times and it represents a substantial improvement on existing solutions to marital breakdown. The Bill will implement many of the proposals in the 1992 White Paper on Marital Breakdown.  In the past many critics claimed that reports on this matter have done little more than gather dust on shelves.  On this occasion that has not happened, and I compliment the Government on taking much needed action in this complex legal field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of divorce laws in Ireland <Col N="163" /> has in no way prevented widespread marriage breakdown.  The 1991 labour force survey shows that approximately 60,000 individuals are affected by marriage breakdown, but the real figure may be higher.  We could opt to bury our heads in the sand in the hope that the problem will go away &mdash; this approach has been taken in the past &mdash; but I am glad the Minister, with courage and the sense of urgency which the problem of marriage breakdown requires, is setting about tackling the many complex issues in this field.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Government is protecting the institution of marriage by raising the age limit from 16 to 18 years.  This follows the recommendations of many reports and bodies, including the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, the Law Reform Commission and the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Statistics show that the risk of marriage breakdown is much higher for those who married at a young age.  Very often those under the age of 18 are not mature enough to enter serious long term contracts &mdash; marriage is perhaps the most important and solemn contract entered into by a person in the course of their entire life.  I welcome the introduction of a three month waiting period for marriage.  This is consistent with the requirements of most Churches. Both of these measures reflect the Government's strong commitment to protecting the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>This Bill will resolve the problems created by the absence of a statutory role for the probation and welfare services in family cases.  The Bill provides that social reports be given by the probation and welfare service and by the health board. This measure will contribute towards protecting the welfare of spouses and particularly children in marital breakdown. The Bill will enable the courts to make financial property and other ancillary orders following the granting of a decree of nullity of marriage.  This is the first time the courts have been given such wide-ranging powers to protect the financial position of a dependent partner in <Col N="164" /> cases of nullity.  The powers given to the courts will cover all aspects of matrimonial property, including houses and other assets, pensions, succession rights and maintenance.</P>
    <P>At present when a marriage is annulled the courts have no power to award maintenance to the dependent parties.  Under the Bill separation and nullity cases will be treated in a similar and corresponding fashion.  It will also provide protection for spouses in cases where nullity, separation or divorce takes place outside the State &mdash; for example, where a husband emigrates to England, gets a divorce and the spouse does not appear in court.  In such cases the spouse can apply to the Irish courts for a maintenance order which can be served in the UK.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals for the first time with the allocation of pensions in nullity and separation cases.  This is a very welcome development.  In nullity cases the courts can either split a pension between the two parties or earmark a benefit for one of them when the payment falls due. These provisions, which have been broadly welcomed by the pensions industry, go way beyond the provisions in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The Bill will improve the application and enforcement of maintenance orders. It also introduces the concept of automatic attachment of earnings.  This is an order under which a husband's employer will be directed to pay the spouse directly.  The Bill also deals with the sale of the family home following a separation. Under the 1976 Family Home Protection Act the sale of the family home was a very complicated matter as the spouse selling the home had to have permission in writing from the other spouse at every stage of the conveyancing. The Bill sets a six year limit on the provisions of the 1976 Act so as to speed up the conveyancing.  This will protect the interests of both spouses and allow enough time for a spouse to challenge the sale of the home.  In addition, power will be given to the courts to make an extensive range of financial orders to protect a dependent spouse in cases where a foreign decree of separation, <Col N="165" /> nullity or divorce is recognised as valid in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to recent newspaper reports which suggest that the outcome of the proposed autumn referendum is in doubt.  I think all of us accept that much work needs to be done before that referendum can take place.  The Bill, with its wide ranging provisions, is an excellent start to this work.  It is important to recognise some of the other measures taken by the Minister, including the increase in funding for the family mediation service.  This voluntary service, which until recently operated mainly on a shoestring budget, has done excellent work in the area of family mediation and has assisted couples who have been the victims of family breakdown in reaching a non-acrimonious solution to their problems; I also welcome the increased allocation to the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>These measures and the other promised legislation is proof of the Government's commitment and determination to put in place the appropriate legislation before the divorce referendum later this year.  We cannot allow a repeat of what happened in 1986.  We cannot forget or abandon those people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  It is imperative that we as a nation show people whose marriages have broken down that we are prepared to deal with their problems in a compassionate and humane way.  These people must be given a second chance and we, as legislators, have a duty to give them such an opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very comprehensive, detailed and complex Bill, which requires much further discussion on Committee Stage in order to tease out its many implications.  Given the background to the 1989 Separation Act, it is unfortunate that once again a constitutional question hangs over this Bill to some degree.  The shadow of the decision of the Supreme Court must also be on our minds today as we discuss this Bill.  The very basic recognition in law of the right of the partner to automatic joint <Col N="166" /> shared ownership in the home, as recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women, has unfortunately been rejected by the Supreme Court.  This raises very serious questions and, despite the Taoiseach's statement in this House to the effect that the Supreme Court has spoken, I urge the Minister to look again at the issue of automatic joint ownership in the home to see whether it is possible to translate this principle into law by making arrangements for those who have already reached legal agreements in regard to the family home.  I know that the Supreme Court was concerned about this matter and I hope the Minister will look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we cannot translate into law a very basic principle of equality which recognises the contribution of the spouse who is not working outside the family home, serious questions will arise about how well our Constitution can deal with equality issues.  I regret very sincerely the refusal of the Government, in the person of the Taoiseach, on a number of occasions to concede that there is any need for a review of our Constitution. At the very least there ought to be a preliminary paper on this issue.  A number of recent issues &mdash; for example, the debate on Articles 2 and 3 and general equality issues &mdash; has shown that the Constitution is stretched to its limits in coping with the society of the 90s.  It would be appropriate to include in the Constitution an equality clause, as recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women.  Such a clause might have impacted on the Supreme Court decision and other decisions which need to be made.  Our Constitution should reflect the needs of the society of the 90s and not of the 30s.  Surely any Constitution needs review.  The society of the 90s is vastly different from the society of the 30s in terms of expectations and the realities for women with children, families, men and women.  I do not think I am asking too much for legislators to keep an open mind on this issue and not to treat the Constitution as if it was carved in stone and never to be looked at again.  This also has implications <Col N="167" /> in terms of our approach to the Downing Street Joint Declaration, the needs of women and divorce.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, but it is surprising that we are discussing it so late in the day.  The Bill contains a wide range of provisions dealing with the legal age at which people can get married, nullity, the implications of the nullity orders granted for property rights, pension rights, foreign divorce, the extension of the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts and notification of marriage.  The fact that we are dealing with the Bill so late in the day highlights the key point that in many ways we have continued to deny the reality of marital breakdown and separation.  For many years the AIM group on family law reform have provided assistance for people whose marriages have broken down.  These people, desperate for advice and information and caught in a real personal tragedy, found again and again that the structures in place &mdash; the legal aid structure, the court structure and the structures governing custody of or maintenance for children &mdash; were not sophisticated or developed enough to deal with the reality of the situation in which they found themselves. To take one small example, it has been confirmed to me today that there is a nine month waiting list for custody reports within the probation and welfare service. This raises serious questions about the practical services which will have to be put in place if this Bill is to be of benefit to people.</P>
    <P>In 1969 a writer described the tragic children of separation, the children caught in the entrenched legal battles of their parents, as the &ldquo;children of Armageddon&rdquo;. I do not think national figures are available on the number of families involved in full scale legal battles over custody and visitation, but I have seen the tragedy these battles have wrought on many families.  I have seen the lack of resources in child and family centres to handle parental visiting rights, for example, in disputed and contentious custody cases and to provide the therapy <Col N="168" /> and supervision which is required for these families.  Who will do this work if we make the legal avenue much more accessible for people?  What about the follow up work that is often needed?  Where will that take place?  I am also aware of the difficulties for many families because we have not faced up to the reality of marital breakdown.  Many children in schools suffer because of social attitudes.  Divorce will not introduce family and marital breakdown, it recognises the reality and is an attempt to deal with it in a humane and legally competent way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the structures that must be put in place, and as marital breakdown is a reality, we must ask what support services and structures are required to deal with this problem.  That raises a complex set of issues and I see divorce as being at the end of that continuum.  There is no doubt that changes within the contemporary family are reshaping the experience of growing up for many children and we must examine these changes in a realistic way.  That will then help us to develop the services to deal with this problem through mediation, legal aid, the courts or counselling services, so that families are supported by the services available and emerge strengthened by their experiences.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have not dealt with these issues in the past &mdash; which I acknowledge the Bill now attempts to do &mdash; has weakened families and prevented them from coping with stress.  To speak of the family in Irish politics, however, is no longer seen to be using a neutral term. Like so many issues it can be hijacked and devalued by fundamentalists of the right and left.  It is important that one can believe in the value of the family, in support for the family while also supporting the concept of divorce.  This seems obvious but we sometimes conduct the debate in such a polarised way that it is not recognised.  We must not only legalise divorce; we must legislate positively for the family and cater for the effects of marital breakdown and divorce when this referendum is held.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, as we approach a referendum on divorce, to <Col N="169" /> deal with property issues, the question of access to the courts and which courts will deal with maintenance and other issues. It is important also &mdash; and I would like the Minister's view on this &mdash; to recognise that the legal system can cause great stress to those trying to deal with these issues, picking up the pieces of their lives and getting on with parenting.  There are many cases, for example, of continued legal contests, which are complex and multi-determined, between separating couples.  There is a growing recognition by many people, particularly mental health professionals, that the adversarial system of the courts is not only poorly suited to resolving family conflict but may intensify it by further dividing the hapless parent and adding to the stress on the family.  It has been said that the adversarial system is ill-suited to deal optimally with custody conflicts, psychically detrimental to children and, therefore, antithetical to good practice.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address this issue and outline how it and other issues can be resolved, particularly those which arise in separation cases?  I would like him to comment on how legal intervention can be kept to the minimum for many families. I realise this may be difficult for the Minister as a solicitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but how can we ensure that the legal system operates in an effective but minimal way rather than placing the legal system at the centre of the situation?</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases in funding to legal aid centres, mediation services, voluntary groups dispensing legal aid, advice and information, but of course it is not enough.  We have not placed the development of our social services and supports for families sufficiently high on our list of social priorities.  The Minister's Department should have much more financial support, this is the essence of the problem.  Are we prepared to allocate resources at the preventative stage rather than waiting until matters have deteriorated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> This is similar to the problem in the health system, the Department of Health should be called the Department of Health and Social Services thereby allowing us to shift the emphasis from the high tech, hospital-centred approach, which has been the case over the years, to a more health promotional, preventative, community care type approach. Obviously, both are needed but we have erred in our approach to justice and in our approach to helping families and health by focusing too much on the point of highest intervention rather than on intervention at an early stage.</P>
    <P>As legislators, we must have an informed debate on the issue of separation and divorce, the changing family and the effects on children.  We must learn from other jurisdictions.  A review is being carried out in England on divorce legislation because it is clear mistakes have been made.  There is an attempt to ensure, for example, that the many issues which arise as a result of a family separating are dealt with before the divorce is granted.  In other words, as many of the problems as possible should be dealt with before the final decision is made by a court.  That is a fundamental point and I would be interested to know the Minister's views on the review in Britain.  It is important to learn from mistakes in other countries and the Government has a serious task in relation to this issue to ensure there is informed discussion.  It is wrong to pretend that a short, sharp campaign is the answer.  There should be a steady and informed degree of public discussion on an ongoing basis in relation to the many issues I mentioned and dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The divorce referendum must be put in its proper context.  Many people are frightened to discuss it at present. Attempts will be made to define the family in an unrealistic, idealised way which does not sufficiently acknowledge the complicated family of the 1990s and the powerful pressures and distress facing many families.  The Government should indicate its approach to divorce.  We need to know this now and we must have a <Col N="171" /> discussion on the matter over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In regard to public policy &mdash; which as legislators we must address &mdash; we must recognise that many families need professional advice and guidance to negotiate their way through the tangled pathway and conflicts of separation and divorce.  It is important not only to provide the services they need but to find ways to reach adults and children at the appropriate times, mainly at the time of marital separation and at critical turning points along the arduous road that lies ahead for many families.  We must provide the necessary services to those experiencing marital breakdown.  I am sure the Minister is aware that most health boards are engaged in crisis work; they are unable to provide &mdash; and I know this from experience &mdash; the type of counselling necessary for families suffering from stress.</P>
    <P>In relation to support for families, we are dealing with juvenile justice legislation from 1908.  Young delinquents are not getting the services they need and in many cases these children come from families who have experienced marital breakdown.  The problem is interconnected. Services must be provided for families at risk and all the evidence indicates that we are not dealing adequately with these families.  In this regard, we must have three agendas.  The first is the preventative agenda which is extremely important when we are discussing a fundamental change.  The second agenda should be the restoration of the family structure and parent-child relationships within the separated, divorced or remarried family.</P>
    <P>The third agenda is in relation to children. The child of a divorced or separated couple faces a special set of challenges. While it is quite clear from research undertaken that many children wear the distress of marital separation or family rupture without huge psychological problems a considerable number do falter along the way.  This is something we must address and not pretend that it is not a problem.  Of course, there are children <Col N="172" /> who end up in better circumstances after separation since they may have been living with extraordinary levels of marital stress and violence.  However, we must also recognise that, for example, one national survey of adolescents whose parents had separated found that 30 per cent of those children by the time they were seven, had received counselling or psychotherapy by the time they reached adolescence compared with 10 per cent of their counterparts in intact families. Much of this research has been undertaken in the United States; we do not have a great deal of data, although there is some emerging here now.  That, too, has implications for the various services.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 46 allow for social reports in family law proceedings. Perhaps the Minister could clarify a point in this respect.  Is it possible for a judge to request an independent report on children and how they are faring as opposed to either of the parties requesting such report, in other words, a sort of guardianship report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that provision. I consider it most important that there be an independent report on the functioning and needs of children in those circumstances.  Children's needs must be central to any discussion of this nature and it would be helpful to such families if that began to be the case.  We have been slow here to place children's needs high on the agenda.  It is crucial, at a time when we are experiencing marital breakdown and considering a referendum on divorce later this year, that we have an informed discussion on this subject.  However, it is distressing to note that the report of the United States Government on human rights in Ireland finds strong evidence that this Government has not been publicising the United Nations Rights of the Child Convention signed by a former Taoiseach some years ago amidst great ceremony.  For example, the US report found that in the past year we have not been highlighting the various <Col N="173" /> points referred to in the convention.  I urge the Minister and the Government to devote more attention to the contents of this report, ensuring that they receive higher priority and are publicised nationwide so that our electorate are clear about them.</P>
      <P>The inability of this Government to deal with poverty and unemployment which so many of our people are experiencing is clearly a major issue for those families affected.  It seems now that children &mdash; and relevant evidence supports this view &mdash; are the quickest route to poverty in Ireland.  We are not supporting the family in the manner in which we ought in terms of financial and/or tax supports.  The presence of unemployment is extraordinarily damaging to family life and, more than anything else, places enormous pressure on children and families.  Here the overall matter of developing community supports is critical.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have the second lowest level of child care services in Europe demonstrates that we are not approaching this issue seriously; only the United Kingdom has less publicly-funded child care services than we have.  I want to know from the Government &mdash; whatever the final amount of Structural Funds made available may be &mdash; what amount will be allocated to child care services? To date we have seriously neglected to meet children's needs.  We need to urgently develop further publicly-funded child care services here.  If we really want to support families in our society we must do so by the development of these types of services, whether it be through providing playgrounds in our parks, flexibility in the workplace or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support families also by our attitude to women in our society, the respect we afford equality issues and the manner in which they are dealt with.  Some responses to the discussion on leakages of the provisions of the Equal Status Bill do not take sufficient account of the importance of the question of &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; which politicians, judges and others in prominent positions do.  For example, it is incompatible with public duty to be <Col N="174" /> a member of a club that discriminates against women, incompatible with the needs of ensuring equality in society.  I make no apologies for saying so. Whether it would be enforceable legally, whether our Constitution would support this contention being translated into law, is another matter.  But we, legislating in this House for equality, should not at the same time be members of clubs that discriminate.  At the very least we should state whether we are members of such clubs.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill cover a wide range of issues which I have endeavoured to place within the wider context of the changes in society we face at present.  As Deputy Currie said, if the Government is serious about family law reform, careful consideration must be given to the overall matter of access to the law, to our courts and court facilities.  If there are insufficient judges to cope with the existing workload, insufficient staff to cope with administration, if major delays occur, what impact will these have on implementing the provisions in this Bill?</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the other detailed provisions in this Bill.  However, the Bill should not serve as a blueprint for the Government's divorce proposals, rather it should form part of the blueprint.  The many other issues I have raised must be addressed and expanded in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a progressive one which is long overdue.  The Government has tackled the reality of the social, economic and psychological problems arising from marriage breakdown in this country today.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill comprise a wide-ranging expansion of family law legislation, providing for the promotion of stability within marriage by recognising that security is necessary to any successful marriage partnership.  This is helped also by the provision to raise the legal age for marriage from 16 to 18 years and a three month period of notification of intention to marry.  Anybody who has lived abroad &mdash; I lived in the United <Col N="175" /> States for a time and was shocked at the number of people who had married at 17 and divorced at 18 years of age &mdash; will realise the importance of this provision. I remember thinking that it was a total farce.  I very much welcome the raising of the legal age for marriage because it is very important, when people decide to marry, that they realise it is a partnership for life.  Any legislative assistance a Government can provide to bring such stability into marriages must be welcomed. I also congratulate the Minister on the three month period of notification of intention to marry which is important, particularly when one realises that elsewhere, in the United States in particular, one can marry at the drop of a hat, within a matter of a couple of hours, and very often this proves to have been a wrong or imprudent decision.  I realise that that does not happen in Ireland, although it may have.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum the provisions of this Bill recognise and establish structures where marriage breakdown has already taken place.  The Government is putting in place provisions accepting that marriage difficulties have arisen.  The Bill provides for the resolution of such difficulties, where they are capable of resolution, through the expansion of mediation services and legal aid.  This in turn, enables easier, less costly access to the courts if disputes cannot be resolved between the parties themselves.  Some interest groups have suggested compulsory mediation, which is worthy of serious consideration.  I might congratulate the various mediation services and the Legal Aid Board for the work they have undertaken in the past. I have been a strong supporter of the mediation services and have lobbied on numerous occasions to have money allocated to them in various budgets.  I have not been anything as successful as the present Minister in getting £750,000 for voluntary marriage counselling, £300,000 for the family mediation services, in addition to £5 million for the Legal Aid Board which will go a long way to help these groups provide a badly needed service. <Col N="176" /> Any examination of the record of many of these mediation services will clearly demonstrate their high success rate in reinstating marriage, getting partners to recognise the various personal problems within their marriages.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 there have been 6,583 applications for separations under the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, of which 2,395 have been granted.  There is a huge backlog of such cases.  The present position is that couples who have filed for judicial separation this year are unlikely to have their cases heard before next Christmas.  This adds to the difficulties which many people experience and is an area that has been badly treated in the past and needs to be tackled by the Government.  Meanwhile the misery continues. The cost of an application for judicial separation, which includes solicitors, barristers and other expenses and the punitive 21 per cent value-added tax applied to solicitors and barristers' fees in family situations, can range between £3,000 and £10,000.  Perhaps the Bill should allow in these exceptional cases of last resort where the marriage contract has broken down to waive the value-added tax element and thereby reduce the Bill by over 20 per cent.  In family law cases there are never any winners and the further hardship imposed and this additional 21 per cent, which none of the parties can recover, seems a further imposition in an already stressed situation. Justice at this price can be justice denied.</P>
    <P>This Bill will attach the relatively successful mechanism of &ldquo;divorce Irish style&rdquo; as it operates under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act to cases of nullity where the courts decide for a number of reasons that the marriage never existed from the outset.  This is to be welcomed in itself as the current inequalities in the nullity law area are both undemocratic and unchristian.  It seems extraordinary that while on the one hand couples can be legally separated and those separations recognised or enforced by the court, on the other hand couples who have their marriages <Col N="177" /> nullified do not have any facility to have financial support mechanisms such as maintenance applied in their situations. The Government is to be applauded for correcting this position with this Bill.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once a husband, always a husband; once a wife, always a wife&rdquo;.  This adage does not hold true at present.  The effect of a decree of nullity voids the marriage from the outset and holds that it never existed, despite the wedding anniversaries, births and christenings.  If the marriage never existed then no provision can be made for a spouse regarding maintenance and, furthermore, all succession rights are extinguished as the marriage is considered never to have existed or taken place.  However, children of the marriage have entitlements under the Succession Act, 1965.  This is an extraordinary situation and is now corrected in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be read in the context of the very comprehensive White Paper on Marital Breakdown prepared by the Government which outlines both the extent of marital breakdown in this country and suggested alternatives to deal with the situation.  These range from better recognition of the financial aspects of nullity and maintenance as set out in this Bill to the possible ultimate introduction of divorce.  This may follow a constitutional referendum to be held possibly in the latter part of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have supported divorce for many years but I do not believe we should have a referendum if we are not prepared for it.  We will probably be prepared for it at the end of this year.  We should not rush headlong into it as we did in 1986 when it was defeated for many good reasons.  This careful and considered consultative approach by Government is in stark contrast to the headlong rush in 1986.  At that point the only apparent remedy to marital breakdown offered to the public was a divorce referendum on its own.  At that time the financial implications of divorce and marriage breakdown did not appear to have been considered.  It resulted in a massive <Col N="178" /> rejection by the public of the divorce amendment itself.  On this occasion the Government will be seen to have involved the public in an open debate and have furnished enlightened and progressive legislation to address all of the financial and property issues which have to be considered in advance of such an important constitutional decision.  The stakes are too high for the issue not to be approached in this way.  We are all aware of the hardship caused by marriage breakdown, and in recognising it as a fact of Irish life it must be confronted and addressed in a sensitive and balanced fashion.  This is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Part I, section 2 (1), has a key definition of the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  It includes persons who are party to a marriage which is void or voidable or in respect of which a foreign decree of divorce or nullity is recognised in the State.  Part IV provides for cost savings by enlarging the jurisdiction of the courts to hear nullity proceedings and to allow both the Circuit Court and the High Court to make the necessary orders.  These orders can be made either at the time of granting the decree of nullity or judicial separation or at any time afterwards.  In the interim section 5 envisages that before such financial determination is decided, urgent orders such as protection, barring and custody orders can be made.</P>
      <P>When marriages break down and couples separate this inevitably leads to financial difficulties for the family.  The court may order periodic payments or lump sums payments, pending determination of the application of nullity or separation.  These payments, whether periodic or of a lump sum nature, may be directed by the court to be secured, and the former may also be the subject of an attachment of earnings order at the time the payments are ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attachment of earnings order to which the Minister referred in his speech is very important.  It has been proven that when one has such an order the financial problems of the separated couple can be lessened considerably.  However, on the basis that financial difficulties can result and be experienced by both parties in the <Col N="179" /> proceedings, before any such attachment order is made the Bill provides for the right of the spouse who is to make the payments to be given an opportunity to make representations to the court in the matter.  Furthermore, it is provided that any periodic payments ordered shall cease upon the marriage of the spouse in whose favour it is made, or indeed any further property adjustment order in their favour.</P>
    <P>Following a decree of nullity or judicial separation a number of property adjustment orders may be made under section 8 (1) of the Family Law Bill.  The courts will take all the circumstances into account.  These orders include transfer of property from one spouse to another, or to a dependent child of the family; an order for settlement of property; an order for variation of ante or post marriage settlements made between spouses, or orders varying or extinguishing or reducing the interest of either spouse under such settlement.  This is important as the courts can now police bad marriage settlements made, particularly if one spouse is under pressure at the time of signing.  The courts will level the playing field and ensure fair play all around.</P>
    <P>This is a very important area because when people are in such a situation there is enormous pressure on them, due to the whole nature of marital breakdown. Other orders which can be made include conferring a right of residency, an order for sale of the family home and the disposal of the proceeds of sale between the parties.</P>
    <P>In the interests of justice and fair play and for the protection of the more vulnerable spouse and dependent children, the long-term financial effects of nullity have been considered and legislated for. To minimise the hardships that may result, the courts have been given a wide ranging power to modify the financial status of both parties to provide a fair division of the marriage property.</P>
    <P>All in all this is fair and balanced legislation which brings people in the nullity limbo into the fairness of the judicial separation mechanisms that have operated <Col N="180" /> since 1989.  The Government intends to continue this programme of legislation to rectify the inadequacies in the law so that there is fair play for all parties concerned.  It is only in this way that we will have a balanced and sensitive approach to deal with the ultimate issue in marriage breakdown, which is the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>The debate on the divorce referendum should be an open and informed debate to ensure that people are aware of the choice before them.  On the last occasion in 1986 the debate was full of confusion and half truths.  As it turned out, some of the arguments we made were wrong because the legislation was not in place. If the divorce referendum, even though I supported it, had been carried, there would have been enormous problems in the courts because of the lack of legislation. We must proceed with caution and ensure that all the necessary legislation is in place rather than rush headlong into a divorce referendum.  Huge mistakes in regard to this issue have been made in other countries.  We must recognise those mistakes and look at things such as the Exeter report, which was published recently, and the problems and the needs of children, which are paramount.  There is no use in saying, as one speaker said, that divorce can sometimes be a challenge to children.  We have to recognise that in many cases those children are not up to the challenge.  This is a huge problem, but I welcome the furthering of this debate.  By the time the referendum is held at the end of the year, one would hope, people will be well informed about the choice they will make.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate as it provides a forum for Deputies to address the forthcoming divorce referendum. The Bill seems to be a masterpiece of distraction in that it refers to introducing powers for the courts to make orders in relation to judicial separations, marital breakdown and the recognition of foreign divorce.  What we are really talking about is divorce and <Col N="181" /> what the position will be if and when we convince the people that divorce is the way forward.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a comprehensive one.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that there is widespread gloom about the possibility of the divorce referendum being carried. We must be courageous and accept that this is the case.  The Bill does not address the public's legitimate worries which might well scupper the referendum.  The worry in the previous referendum was in relation to property and the financial implications of marriage breakdown, but now the main public worry is about children. It would be an exercise in distraction for this House not to respond to these fears and have a full debate on how marital breakdown affects children.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill to the House the Minister outlined its main purpose and then voiced his regret at and acceptance of the Supreme Court decision regarding the Matrimonial Home Bill which was held to be unconstitutional.  I regret that everyone does not have a copy of the Supreme Court judgment.  The Minister and his officials should revisit that judgment because I am not inclined to cave in so readily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one.  The Minister said that the Supreme Court judgment struck down what is, in effect, the central principle of the Bill, namely the establishment of joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the norm within marriage.  In the light of that judgment the Government has already announced there is no alternative legislative route which can safely be taken to achieve a broadly similar result.  He went on to say the Bill was an attempt to copperfasten the principle of equality in marriage and was aimed at stable marriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not recall that the concept of a stable marriage was spoken about in the debate on the Matrimonial Home Bill. We had a fulsome contribution from all sides and now much is being made in a revisionist way about the notion of a <Col N="182" /> stable marriage.  It is an attempt by the Government to accept the bottom line of the Supreme Court judgment and not look to the arguments made in the judgment which were very supportive of the notion of joint ownership of the matrimonial home within marriage.  The Government is fleeing with indecent haste from the principle of joint ownership within marriage and I regret this is the only opportunity I have had to raise the matter with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The principle was a good one and for the Government to give in at the first obstacle shows a lack of courage and belief in that principle which the House supported.  We must look at the original motivation of the Bill.  The courts had decided in a series of cases, particularly in L &amp; L, that they were not prepared to extend the principle of joint ownership of the family home to instances where the wife had not made any financial contribution to the home.  The gist of the judgment was basically that they could not extend any further the notion of a wife having equity in the matrimonial home where she made no material or financial contribution.  The judges said it was a matter of social policy on which the Oireachtas should legislate.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see the agruments put forward by the Attorney General in support of the Bill and those put forward by counsel to challenge the Bill.  The Attorney General's argument was that the Bill supported marriage and should be constitutional.  It secured the family home for the family; emphasised the partnership in marriage; contained a mechanism which secured the interests of the wife working within the home and provided security for spouses and children in the event of marriage breakdown. Much reliance was placed on the decision in L &amp; L, where, at page 107, it was stated that anything that would help to encourage that basis of full sharing in property values as well as every other way between the partners in a marriage must directly contribute to the stability of the marriage, the institution of the family and the common good.</P>
    <P>Counsel for the other side argued successfully <Col N="183" /> that such a blanket and mandatory creation of a joint tenancy was a disproportionate intervention in the authority of the family.  They had a point. The Bill did not try to address a particular category of spouses but was expansive and indiscriminate in its application and on that point the judges said it was a &ldquo;disproportionate intervention&rdquo;.  They said provisions do not constitute reasonably proportionate interventions by the State and went on to say that the provisions of the Bill did not seek to apply to particular categories of cases only.  In other words, they upheld the fundamental principle, which was a good one and had the support of the House, that to help and support the notion of an equal partnership in marriage is supportive of marriage but because it was mandatory and interfered in decisions entered into by the spouses it was not reasonably proportionate.  They said that as one section of the Bill offended the Constitution the whole Bill must fall.  I got a clear signal from that judgment that they were not blowing the fundamental principle of joint ownership out of the water but that the Bill, as framed, was too expensive.</P>
    <P>It was complex legislation and we were blinded by its detail.  We had constitutional qualms about it but never imagined that they would relate to Article 41, the authority of the family. The notion of a stable marriage, which has been introduced in the flight from the principle of joint ownership, is one which arouses considerable annoyance in me. What is a stable marriage?  Is stability in marriage to be a matter of law?  The Minister is saying that the State can only intervene in marriage when the marriage is at the point of breakdown.</P>
    <P>The emphasis of this and all legislation surrounding family law should be to buttress and support marriages when they are viable.  The Minister is saying to women that when their marriage breaks down, but not before, they can be assured that the courts will see them right and look to the contribution they made by way of their home making.  However, <Col N="184" /> that will be at the judge's discretion and that is not enough.  In the context of a stable marriage they cannot assume that they have joint ownership or believe that they have a stake in the house which is usually the main asset of a family.  They may have been working in the home looking after children or elderly parents and unable to contribute to the purchase of the matrimonial home.  Many women are horrified that they have not been given the assurance that, as a result of their work in the home, they have a stake in the matrimonial home.  It is not very reassuring to women working in the home that they do not have a stake in the house.  The Minister will recall that it was this worthy category of women to whom we were originally trying to address the benefits of the Matrimonial Home Bill.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the judgment has not been analysed further and that the Government is accepting the bottom line without a whimper.  It is clear the judges rejected the Bill because it was disproportionate in its application and also an intervention into the authority of the family.  I believe, however, there must be another way to focus on women working in the home who have no possibility of earnings to contribute to the mortgage.  There must be a way to frame legislation to meet that need.  I see the Supreme Court judgment as a comma rather than a full stop in the long march to joint ownership of the family home in the context of women's rights within marriage.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the Minister of the long gestation of joint ownership in the family home.  The First Commission on the Status of Women recommended 20 years ago that legislation should be framed that would enshrine joint ownership of the family home.  Subsequent legislation protected the spouse from a vindictive partner selling the home over her head without conferring ownership and it was left to the Judiciary to develop the law.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Minister to recognise that for many women economic dependence in marriage is a major cause of depression and a feeling of disempowerment. <Col N="185" /> It contributes to an overall climate of unhappiness if a woman can only rely on the breakdown of her marriage to be awarded the right of joint ownership in the family home.  I reject the Minister's revisionist justification that the Matrimonial Home Bill was a bad idea.</P>

      <P>I know he is disappointed but I urge him to reconsider the Matrimonial Home Bill.  I have spoken to judges, constitutional and family lawyers and academics who say that this Bill must be revisited as it is not appropriate that this Coalition Government which had a commitment to the principle of joint ownership should run away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals in detail with the financial maintenance of both spouse and children following the breakdown of a marriage and a decree of judicial separatation or nullity.  I agree with previous speakers that nothing in the Bill deals significantly with the emotional maintenance of children.  The Bill fails dismally to address the most important issue arising from the breakdown of marriage, which is what will happen to the children and how divorce and judicial separation is managed by the institutions set up to manage the breakdown.  This will clearly colour the possibility of success or failure in the forthcoming divorce referendum. The financial maintenance of children cannot be divorced from the emotional maintenance of children.  The Bill does not address key problems and issues surrounding the custody of children. Nowhere is it questioned that the best decision is always to give custody to the mother and limited access to the father. There is nothing in the Bill which seeks to explore new models of custody based on learned experience in other jurisdictions where they have had a long experience of divorce and marriage breakdown.  I think we can learn from the bad experiences of the United States where some 30 states have now adopted <Col N="186" /> joint custody models after marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The adversarial and litigious model of judicial separation and divorce must be questioned and changed now.  I do think it is sufficient for this Bill to try to bend the existing facilities in the Circuit Court, as it will be swamped by the volume of litigation.  The adversarial nature of judicial separation proceeding exacerbates the trauma of marital breakdown. The court's focus on financial maintenance pitches the parties against each other which brings out the worst in individuals, leaving the children to live in the war zone of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State Governments have failed, in spite of the pious aspirations of the Constitution, to support the institution of marriage and to be supportive of families in the various ways the State can impact on their lives. The State has consistently refused to be proactive in encouraging proper child care and the division of responsibilities for child care.  Last week I took the Minister to task for his lethargy in encouraging and supporting measures to provide workplace crèches for working parents. There is no interest in this House in the need for the workforce to respond to the changing role of women working outside the home who still have to bear full responsibility for child care arrangements. Women's lives have changed enormously in the past 30 years.  Thank God for that &mdash; I would not be here otherwise &mdash; yet there has been no legislative recognition of the duality and complexity of women's lives, given equality and opportunities to work in the professions, politics and at all levels in society.  Women bear the main brunt of responsibility for the care of children and as soon as their child care responsibilities finish they are presented with the expensive and traumatic responsibility for elderly and infirm parents and the management of their old age.  There is no evidence that this Government or previous Governments have taken an interest in the fulfilment of women and their ability to combine working and parenting duties.  If equality is to be anything <Col N="187" /> more than a pious aspiration, it means questioning a range of presumptions about how work is shared and how families can function properly in the context of the changed needs and aspirations of women.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to take part in a survey to prove the need for a Dáil crèche and inherent to that request is a deep seated reluctance to accept the rights of women and family to be integrated into the workforce.  What hope have we of influencing public opinion if this House refuses consistently to budge on the issue of a Dáil crèche?</P>
    <P>The theme running through the Bill is that we are doggedly preparing for the worst.  We are not planning for the best and the Bill does not address the reality when divorce will be introduced.  There is an air of gloom among the general population because they fear the divorce referendum will not be successful.  I share their gloom because Fianna Fáil Ministers have been sitting on their hands and have not helped the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The Bill in its attempt to be pragmatic and deal with dependants following nullity is attempting to treat them in the same way as following a judicial separation. That is a curious and a dubious way of dealing with the matter.  While this may be necessary in some cases, it highlights the hypocritical way in which we have dealt with the question of marriage breakdown.  Many people have sought nullity decrees in the absence of divorce.  It is disingenuous to suggest that judicial separation and nullity are the same, they are different.  Nullity and divorce are also different concepts.  We are fudging the issue on the basis of pragmatism. If we say that a marriage never existed but nonetheless spouses and dependants have obligations and rights, there is no justification for not extending these rights to cohabitees and, by extension, to their dependants.  I await the Minister's comments with interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most extensive family law measures to be <Col N="188" /> presented in recent times.  I wish to congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for introducing this much needed legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill re-enacts substantial portions of the Judicial and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and will allow considerable discretion to rearrange or adjust pension rights or earmark pensions to protect the original spouse.  The Bill contains many complex provisions and it would be advisable to examine the various sections at great length on Committee Stage.  Until now, the High Court had exclusive jurisdiction to grant decrees annulling marriages. This jurisdiction derived from the Ecclesiastical Courts which had exclusive jurisdiction until 1870 when the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Amendment) Act was passed.  Under section 13 of that Act a new civil court was established.</P>
      <P>The law on nullity to which the previous speaker referred has for the most part been developed by judges.  The Judiciary have developed the nullity principles taking into account advancements in the field of psychiatry and psychology. It is proposed to make considerable changes in the law on nullity, and jurisdiction will now be conferred on the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>It would appear at first sight that people seeking annulments will have greater access to the courts but the outcome could be different and may well be a cause for concern.  There are not enough judges to deal with the number of cases that will have to be dealt with.  While it is important to provide remedies it is also important to provide adequate resources to ensure that access will not be restricted due to a backlog of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors have led to a backlog of cases in the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine family law proceedings on the following matters: judicial separation; ancillary orders made pursuant to orders for judicial separation; guardianship; protection and barring orders; the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, especially section 12 which is of vital <Col N="189" /> importance in disputes between spouses over the title to or the possession of any property in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling to which reference has been made; the Family Home Protection Act, 1976; the Partition Acts, 1868 and 1876; maintenance; wardship; injunctions and the Family Law Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>As a practitioner I am aware that one day per session is set aside in the Circuirt Court on each circuit to deal with family law cases.  This is inadequate in dealing with complex matters.  By granting the Circuit Court jurisdiction to deal with nullity cases the pressure will be enormous. It can take three to four days to hear and determine a nullity case.  This could defeat the purpose in allowing litigants who, unfortunately, are unable to resolve their difficulties without having recourse to the courts, greater access to them.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, to increase the number of Circuit Court judges by at least eight and designate these judges as family law judges; to reorganise the Circuit Court sittings to ensure that one week on a particular circuit is devoted to family law cases with a specialist family law judge presiding and to upgrade the facilities available to litigants, particularly consultation rooms.  Consultations are often conducted in overcrowded rooms within earshot of the other parties to the case.  This has led to increased tension and confirms the perception of litigants that the system is adversarial.  It is not uncommon to find lawyers and litigants conducting consultations or settlement negotiations in passageways or on the street.  This is not conducive to the efficient administration of justice which is the aim of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Catherine McGuinness on her appointment to the Circuit Court.  She has a wealth of experience in the area of family law.  The Government should appoint more judges with experience and expertise in this area.  To date, Catherine McGuinness is the only woman to have been appointed to the Circuit Court.  The Government should appoint more <Col N="190" /> women judges in meeting the need for at least eight more judges.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 (6) the court will be permitted to make an attachment of earnings order when a maintenance order is being made by the presiding judge.  The spouse who will have to make the payments will also be allowed an opportunity to make representations on this matter.</P>
    <P>A maintenance order may now be made in proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  This provision is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  If the circumstances of a maintenance debtor change, as often happens, he may apply to the court for a variation of the maintenance order made against him.  Up to now, if the maintenance debtor refused to pay or did not bother to seek to have the amount varied the maintenance creditor had to go back to court to seek enforcement of the maintenance order. The current proposal to expand the provisions relating to the attachment of earnings will be welcomed by maintenance creditors who have lost out in the absence of this much needed provision.</P>
    <P>In examining nullity decrees we must bear in mind that such a decree pronounces a marriage to be null and void. The marriage is thus declared to have been invalid from the date of initiation. In the case of a marriage which the parties are entitled to treat as void without obtaining a decree, the decree does not apply retrospectively, it merely declares that the marriage is void <i>ab initio</i>.  In the case of a voidable marriage the decree effects a change in the status of the parties and will apply retrospectively.  A voidable marriage is valid until it is set aside by a nullity decree.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands the parties to a void or voidable marriage which has been annulled are not considered to be spouses and are not entitled to the various remedies, protections and benefits which the law confers on a married couple.  Neither can apply for maintenance unless it is to be used to support a dependent child under the Family Law <Col N="191" /> (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 or for a barring or protection order under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  The various protections afforded by the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, in respect of the family home and other matrimonial property are not available, nor are the rights of succession afforded the spouses by the Succession Act, 1965. Questions have arisen as to whether a person is entitled to retain any financial benefit, for example, under a maintenance order derived from the foregoing legislation, prior to obtaining a nullity decree.  The legislation before the House is useful in so far as it brings clarity and certainty into this complex area of law. This is an important function of any legislation but, although the provisions for reliefs in the case of nullity may be desirable, they may be open to constitutional challenge.  Cohabitees may well claim that they are entitled to a similar level of protection as married couples.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to comment on the law relating to barring and protection orders.  The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, provides a system of barring and protection orders for the benefit of spouses and children whose safety and welfare is put at risk by the conduct of the other spouse.  Only a spouse may apply for a barring or protection order. This means that cohabitees are not entitled to apply, nor is it possible to bar other relatives or members of the household.  In these instances the applicant's remedy would be by way of an injunction.  I urge the Minister to bring forward legislation to fill this lacuna and thus take cognisance of the changes that have occurred since the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>The greatest advances relate to the making of financial and property orders, which were ancillary to a decree of judicial separation, under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The 1989 Act permitted the court to examine a wide range of options to ensure a fair distribution of property and other resources between separated <Col N="192" /> spouses.  The property adjustment order was the most significant of these ancillary orders which were not previously available in family law proceedings.  Other orders, such as those relating to the occupation of the family home, orders for the sale of the family home and orders extinguishing possession rights, are also important advances.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 31 relating to the minimum age for marriage is necessary and is an important amendment to the current law as set out in the Marriages Act, 1972, which permits marriage at the age of 16.  This is a sensible provision because young people will have a greater awareness of their responsibilities and the nature of the commitment they are entering into at the age of 18.  It is noteworthy that people are not allowed to vote in this jurisdiction until they have reached the age of 18.  It was ludicrous that people could get married at 16 years of age but could not exercise the franchise in the selection of the parties by which they wished to be governed until they reached the age of 18.  This provision, together with the provision that three month's notice of marriage must be given, will help to protect the institution of marriage and lead to greater stability in marriage.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the requirements of notification as set out in section 32 (2) which states:</P>
    <P>The Registrar shall notify each of the persons concerned in writing of the receipt by him or her of a notification under sub-section (1) and, upon receipt by him or her of such notification he or she, shall make it available at his or her office or place of business for inspection by members of the public during ordinary office hours in the month following its receipt.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about this provision and ask the Minister to amend or possibly delete it.  If the publication process envisaged full-scale publication there would be some attendant difficulties and an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individuals concerned. A number of churches already have notification <Col N="193" /> procedures in place.  Accordingly, there is no need for the publication procedure to be vested in the registrar.  A more useful approach might be to extract and harmonise the procedures already in use by the various churches.</P>
    <P>Section 33 permits the exemption of certain marriages from the application of section 31 (1) which deals with the age requirement and section 32 (1) which deals with the notice requirement.  It is stated in section 32 (2) (d) that such application which will be made to the court shall not be granted unless the applicant shows that its grant is justified by serious reasons and is in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage.  It would be profitable to set out what serious reasons are envisaged by the Minister as being important enough to warrant the granting of the application.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for his undoubted commitment to the delivery of strong support services in the event of marriage breakdown.  A brief examination of the allocations by the Department demonstrates that he has delivered in this area.  We have seen substantial increases for counselling services, mediation services and the Civil Legal Aid Board.  It is always preferable that considerable time and resouces be expended in exploring the possibility for reconciliation and this has been greatly facilitated by the provision of expanded counselling services.  Only last week the Minister announced a substantial increase in the number of legal aid centres and I congratulate him on that. At this stage I must be parochial and tell the Minister that we need a legal aid centre in Mullingar.  I am using this opportunity to call up him &mdash; I know he always listens &mdash; to ensure that we get this service in 1995.</P>
    <P>Legal aid centres have long waiting lists and we are all aware that justice delayed is justice denied.  Many of my constituents have to go to Athlone legal aid centre and take their place in the queue.  The staff in the legal aid centres are working above and beyond the call of duty to deal with the ever increasing number of cases and I am glad the Minister <Col N="194" /> is in a position to give additional resources to these centres.  I look forward to the Minister being in a position to bring good news to Mullingar and its environs in 1995.</P>
    <P>The right of access to courts was first recognised by Mr. Justice Kenny in the High Court in the case of Macauley <i>v</i> the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1966). However, the constitutional right of access to the court may, on grounds of expense alone, prove the theoretical only and it has been recognised that the cost of litigation may effectively preclude access to court.  The civil legal aid scheme has been unable to meet all the demands made upon it.  It would be appropriate to examine the levy payable to the State by litigants in the form of stamp duty on legal documents and other charges and the high VAT rate imposed on both solicitors' and barristers' fees, as they may have a major deterrent effect on people who require access to courts and who have limited resources.</P>
    <P>This Bill re-enacts substantial portions of the 1989 Act which provided the basic framework for separation, dealing with custody, maintenance, division of property and other essential matters.  Cognisance should be taken of the constitutional challenge which is now before the High Court to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 which will have the effect of at least adding certainty to this area of law when the judicial pronouncement is made.</P>
    <P>Section 46 deals with a matter about which I have been concerned for some time.  I brought it to the attention of the Minister for Justice on a number of occasions and, therefore, I welcome the provision in the legislation for the presentation of social reports in family law cases.  That will resolve the problem created by the absence of a statutory role for the probation and welfare service in such cases.  The provision whereby social reports may be given by the probation and welfare service and health boards will contribute significantly to the protection of spouses and children in cases of marital breakdown.  That matter was not highlighted by many other Members <Col N="195" /> but I certainly noted its inclusion in the legislation and I compliment the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important and balanced legislation and contributes greatly to the corpus of legislation in the area of family law.  It is one of the most extensive Bills on family law introduced recently and I compliment the Minister on his work in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this legislation. In introducing the Bill the Minister stated that the Government's approach to law reform is practical and caring, focused on the areas of high social priority and that there is a real and pressing need for legislation and administrative measures to deal with the growing problems of marital breakdown.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, is the first in a series of legislative measures which the Minister believes will address the problems effectively and I agree wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>The Bill increases the legal age of marriage from 16 to 18 years and, for the first time three month's notice will be required before a couple can get married. Those measures are important signals from the Government of its firm intention to protect the institution of marriage and they will clarify matters for those who might misunderstand the purpose of this legislation.  For many years there has been a growing concern about the absence of a statutory role for the probation and welfare service in family law cases and the Minister has taken this opportunity to deal with the matter.  Such reports will greatly assist those assessing the difficulties experienced by people in our courts and will make a real contribution to the welfare of spouses and children in the case of marriage breakdown. It is an important provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department estimates that, in tandem with the enactment of this legislation, a sum of £750,000 will be provided <Col N="196" /> for voluntary marriage counselling organisations and for measures to promote the International Year of the Family.  I welcome the allocation of £300,000 for the family mediation service which is double that provided last year and will enable the service to expand outside Dublin.  Legal aid centres will receive an allocation of £5 million, an increase of 56 per cent on last year, the largest increase in the history of the legal aid service.  That additional money will enable us to tackle the problem of waiting lists, new law centres can be opened and extra staff recruited.  This is tangible evidence of the Government's firm commitment to provide the necessary support for families and to assist in minimising the difficulties associated with marital breakdown.  The Tallaght law centre will benefit greatly from such funding as it will shorten the waiting list for people seeking advice and will make access to the services of the legal profession more amenable to the vulnerable sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in respect of pension adjustment and financial compensation orders which will give the courts the necessary powers to deal with pension rights.  This new provision is very important in dealing with family resources and the pension rights of partners in the case of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court will now have the power to hear nullity cases which at present are heard in the High Court.  The move to the Circuit Court will reduce considerably the cost of such cases and thereby give many more people access to such services.  In regard to separation and maintenance, new powers will be provided for the preservation of pension rights where appropriate.  The existing law on maintenance will be strengthened and the new provisions will ensure a much wider use of the courts in respect of attachment of earnings orders.  I am conscious of the recent research carried out in those areas and from my experience the new provisions will greatly benefit those deprived of the service at present.</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of a series of <Col N="197" /> measures designed to strengthen and improve the position of injured parties in marital breakdown cases.  I presume it is the Minister's intention that all those issues will be clarified and that the necessary financial powers will be given to the courts to clear the way for the divorce referendum later in the year.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a series of provisions to be introduced by this Government in the area of law reform for which the Minister is responsible.  It is one of the most extensive Bills on family law to come before this House.  It substantially modernises and increases the powers of the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown and extends those powers to cases of nullity and foreign divorces.  It creates new remedies and jurisdictions and makes the law more accessible.  In effect, the Bill extends power to the courts for the support of spouses and dependent children in the case of marriage breakdown in all circumstances except domestic divorce.</P>
    <P>With a view to safeguarding and protecting the institution of marriage the increase in the legal age at which a person can marry signifies that perhaps easy access to marriage is one of the problems of marriage breakdown.  The seriousness of marriage must be recognised by ensuring that people who enter such a complex contract know precisely the long term consequences.  The Bill contains important new provisions in respect of the jurisdiction of courts in proceedings for a decree of nullity.  At present jurisdiction is confined to the High Court and under the Bill it will be extended to the Circuit Court to bring it in line with that for separation proceedings.  That provision will improve access to the courts and reduce costs.  The Bill provides comprehensive remedies which can be secured through the courts by spouses and children to deal with problems of marriage breakdown.  It gives statutory recognition to the principle that following a marriage breakdown a spouse is obligated to maintain and accommodate the other spouse and children, if any, to the fullest extent possible.  In cases where this obligation is not met and in the absence <Col N="198" /> of an agreement on such matters, the court should be in a position to intervene on the basis of a comprehensive range of powers to order maintenance, lump sums, security payments and the restitution of property, mainly the family home and pension rights.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court's decision that the Matrimonial Home Bill was unconstitutional resulted in considerable publicity and a great deal of contrary opinion as to its impact on the divorce referendum to be held later this year.  The judgment struck down the central principle of the Bill, namely, the establishment of joint ownership of the marital home as being the norm.  In the light of that judgment the Government announced that there is no alternative legislative route to achieve a similar result.  The essence of the Bill was an attempt to copperfasten the principle of equality in marriage.  It was not framed to deal with marriage breakdown, separation, nullity or divorce.  If couples obtain a judicial separation the division of property is a matter for the courts to decide in accordance with the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The provision in the Matrimonial Home Bill would not have affected that position.</P>
    <P>The major thrust of the Bill deals with the power of the courts to make decisions in respect of finance, property and ancillary orders on the granting of a decree of nullity.  It may surprise some people that following the granting of a decree of nullity the courts have no power to order maintenance in support of a former spouse or restitution of property between both spouses.  Many people will know of cases where the Catholic Church has granted annulments and find it difficult to understand why the State does not allow people whose marriages have been annulled to marry again.  The implementation of such a provision would conform with the rulings of the Catholic Church, which is not regarded as progressive in the area of social legislation. In the area of annulments the State is not in tune with the Church.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a wide range of social <Col N="199" /> legislation dealing with the many difficulties couples experience in marriage breakdown.  Marriage difficulties may affect people's health and lead to problems of anti-social behaviour and in coping with relationships.  The effects of marriage breakdown are so great that we must introduce some regulation to deal with those issues and prevent problems in areas of education where children suffer greatly because of the difficulties experienced by spouses who try to keep the family unit together.  Civil legal aid centres are the first point of contact for many people who seek advice on marital problems and the new law centres being financed by the Minister will be of great benefit, especially in the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>The lack of legislation dealing with separation in many cases leads to family violence, particularly where couples have no acceptable alternative but to remain in the marriage.  That causes a great deal of stress and in many cases violence.  Due to financial difficulties the husband may resort to drink and abuse the family, especially his wife who is under great strain trying to keep the family home together.  Those difficulties are manifested in many ways.  Women will be pleased that the legislation will provide a clear guideline as to what rights they have should they suffer from the problems associated with a marriage breakdown. Husbands to a lesser extent also suffer and will have access to the same facilities.</P>
    <P>The matter of dividing the family home and resources to ensure that nobody loses their legal entitlements will be clearly stated and everyone will have access to the courts to deal with those difficulties. Children of 18 years and older who live in the family home will also have access to the courts for protection should they experience any difficulty exercising their rights.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's work in the area of family support.  His expertise has helped the weakest section of the community. This legislation is an example of his commitment to that section of society. I congratulate him on his contribution <Col N="200" /> and wish him well in the future and assure him of my support.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's ineptitude and mishandling of the negotiations and preparation of the National Development Plan 1994-99, and calls on it to lay before the Dáil details of the revisions to the plan that have been discussed with the EU Commission with a clear outline of the annual level of investment from the EU, the Exchequer and the private sector; and affirms that the taxpayer should not be asked to contribute any extra own resources to make up for the shortfall of finance arising from the Government's incompetence and false claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there was a programme on television entitled &ldquo;Call my Bluff&rdquo; in which there were three members on each team.  Each side picked an unusual word and the three members of the team put forward convincing arguments about what this word meant.  However, only one version was correct; the other two were bluffing.  What the Government has persisted with since last October is a game of call my bluff, with Ministers coming into the House and giving different interpretations of what was happening with the national plan.  We knew they were bluffing but the public has been clearly misled.  The Government has been downright disingenuous and shifty in its approach to this matter.  There has been, as we saw last week, a clear discrepancy between its public stance and <Col N="201" /> its private understanding of the position. This has resulted in a pathetic but unparalleled humiliation for the Government at home and, more seriously, abroad which is entirely of its own making.  The reports of last Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, which I will deal with in some detail, show that the Government is, if not openly divided, clearly in total disarray.</P>
    <P>This story is far from over.  The revised proposals presented to the European Commission last Thursday morning &mdash; an across-the-board cut of 8.5 per cent in the national plan &mdash; will be rejected.  This suggested revision of the original national plan is vague and is only an opening offer, a negotiating stance.  It is more of the ridiculous stonewalling by the Government whose credibility is greatly damaged. More selective specific cuts are required to individual projects and schemes.  From my sources in Brussels I learned that cuts in the order of between 13 and 20 per cent are required to make the national plan acceptable &mdash; this will be self-evident in the coming weeks and months.  An 8.5 per cent cut is equivalent to a saving of £500 million on the proposed expenditure.  A minimum of £730 million is required.  I understand that 12 of the offices of directors general raised serious questions about individual components of the plan.  When the Community Support Framework is published and the operational programmes become evident we will see that the Government's position of last Thursday is untenable and is still not at the bottom line.</P>
    <P>An elaborate attempt has been made to mislead the Dáil and the Irish people, resulting in a woeful mess.  We have had many quotes such as that from a Government spokesman, &ldquo;All projects to go ahead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nothing has changed&rdquo;, said the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Finance said, &ldquo;There will be no revised national plan&rdquo; and the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;No new national plan&rdquo;.  These people sought to avoid the blunt reality.  The inevitable moment of truth has yet to come.  There will be no hiding place for the Government on the central issue of the need to scale down and revise the plan.  Until that <Col N="202" /> is done, the plan will unravel on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach of winks and nods in Europe has resulted in it sustaining a bloody nose and egg on its face.  In an attempt to save face the Government has abused European officials and whinged about the Commission. After 20 years in which successive Commissioners saw it as their job to represent the interests of smaller nations and goodwill has been shown to Ireland, we realise that it has been for nothing.  The accusation against Mr. Landaburu, of &ldquo;publicly beating his drum&rdquo;, by a Minister in answer to questions at the Regional Affairs Committee was at best counterproductive and at worst downright stupid.</P>
    <P>The reports of last Tuesday's Cabinet meeting are extraordinary.  The Minister for Finance proved indecisive and inept. He agreed with his officials and with the Tánaiste on a package of cuts of £730 million.  He signed a memorandum that was faxed to these people on Monday between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock.  Subsequently, when he had this early morning session with the soldiers of destiny in Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He then joined the Cabinet revolt against his own memorandum and, in a breath-taking somersault, opposed his own proposals. Not satisfied with abandoning his officials, the Minister sought to blame them for the débâcle.  I read in a series of weekend reports that Mr. Bob Curran and Mr. Michael Tutty were the authors of these proposals and were to blame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will leave them out, but it is little wonder that I read in the same report of strains between the Minister and Department of Finance officials. These incontinent leaks from the Cabinet portray the Government bootboy, namely, pitbull Brian, as having savagely objected to the proposal of a 33 per cent cut in his Department's capital programme. Some of the Sunday newspaper depictions of that Minister waving a broken bottle in front of a petrified Taoiseach are somewhat excessive.  It was stated that Albert just kept grinning through the entire affair in the firm belief that reality was what he said it was.  &ldquo;Bulldog Brian&rdquo; led the revolt and the Minister for Finance was not long following suit.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, has many headaches &mdash; Irish Steel, an unemployment level of 300,000 and his human resources programme which is up the &ldquo;swanny&rdquo;.  It is clear that Minister Quinn is over-stressed with his current workload. His petulant performance in this House last Friday, his walk out, was a direct result of the dressing down Commissioner Bruce Millan gave him last Wednesday night when, as I understand, he was told in no uncertain terms that his £3 billion job and training schemes would have to be modified.  His intrepid performance in Brussels has been likened by officials to that of a dead sheep.</P>

    <P>Needless to say, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs was abroad when this important Cabinet meeting took place.  I call on the Taoiseach to insist that future Cabinet meetings are held at the same time as rugby internationals so that there is a reasonable prospect of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs attending them instead of talking to him <Col N="204" /> on a phone link with some other country. There is no escaping the reality that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs dropped the ball on 20 July when his handshake with President Delors did not secure the £7.84 billion he thought he had in the bag.  His failure that night is the basis for the Government's humiliation now.  His increasing tendency to berate members of the media &mdash; we hear he wanted to talk to named journalists last week &mdash; is less than inspiring and not in keeping with the high standards he espoused when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>In the wings we have Dame Eithne who surely must get the award for the most memorable quotation in this shambles. I wish to quote from what must be a very valuable clipping from a recent edition of the <i>Sunday Press</i> which states:</P>
    <P>Minister Fitzgerald said she believes officials from Brussels will &ldquo;recognise ultimately that we are the experts on this country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, she resembles Mavis in &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, a whimpering, indecisive and directionless character. On 23 November last her replies to parliamentary questions on the National Development Plan, and especially on Tallaght hospital, were so inaccurate and incorrect as to raise queries about her integrity and capacity to mislead this House.  Lest I am accused of being unfair to the Minister of State I wish to quote from statements made by her in the Dáil on 23 November.  In reply to my question about whether she was aware of newspaper reports that the plan had run into very heavy weather with EC officials, the Minister of State replied:</P>
    <P>I am happy to have this opportunity to inform the Dáil that there is absolutely no basis for these reports. We have not run into any obstacles in the course of those negotiations and I do not anticipate that we will.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Minister has proven to be somewhat wide of the mark again.</P>
    <P>We then have the most mysterious, collective and appalling attempt of all to mislead the public.  Last Tuesday night <Col N="205" /> the Government released a one page statement on the national plan.  That afternoon questions on the plan were raised in this House and on the same day there was a blazing gun battle in Cabinet after the early morning <i>contretemps</i> at which the Minister had done his somersault. After all this pain and suffering, we were told that the Government was fully committed to the implementation of the National Development Plan as published. It went on to say that we would secure extra funding in the mid-term review, we would have increased Exchequer funding and would draw down even more than we expected.  This statement was issued after Ministers had nearly torn out each other's eyes in the debate about which Departments were to bear the cuts.  Within 36 hours of issuing this statement Government officials were presenting an 8.5 per cent cut in the plan to EU officials.  The Government knew at the time it issued that statement that the situation was not tenable.  This was subsequently proven to be the case. As a result of the Cabinet revolt the Government was in such disarray it could not recognise reality.</P>
    <P>This is a repeat performance by the same brazen scriptwriters who gave us the devaluation collapse; wearing green jerseys, they depict critics and, in particular, the Opposition as anti-national. The subsequent tragedy of errors showed the Government wriggling on the hook of its own incompetence.  This was followed by the day of reckoning when the white flag appeared.  In a welter of confusion everyone except the Government is blamed for this crisis &mdash; on last occasion it was the Bundesbank and the speculators who were blamed.  It is the Government's failure to confront the financial facts of life which led to the whirlwind of panic and recrimination both now and in the past.  The Government must now outline where the cuts in the plan are to occur.  <i>Pro rata</i> alterations disguise the real effect of tough decisions on semi-State companies, the light rail transit system for Dublin, the Tallaght Hospital, local and regional roads and the 100,000 places on job and training schemes.  Until <Col N="206" /> such time as the Government comes clean on the changes, all these projects will remain in jeopardy, with resultant confusion about their source of funding.</P>
    <P>The central fact remains that the National Development Plan has to be revised.  Fine Gael is deeply concerned by the reference of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;.  It would be totally unacceptable to ask taxpayers to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for this fiasco. The amount of money at stake is equivalent to any of the following tax impositions. To pay for the shortfall out of own resources the Minister for Finance would have to either reintroduce the 1 per cent income levy, increase the standard rate of tax by 2 per cent, increase the top rate of income tax by 3 per cent to 48 per cent or reduce the standard rate tax band by £2,000.  The middle income sector, which has less medical expenses relief, less mortgage relief and less VHI relief and is faced with the residential property tax, has had enough.  This over-burdened sector will not carry any further the strain of the Government bungling.</P>
    <P>The story of the shrinking billions can be summarised as follows.  After the devaluation crisis we were told, applying the arithmetic after the Edinburgh deal, we could reasonably expect £8.6 billion. After the midnight handshake between Dick and Delors on 30 July last year we were assured that the minimum we would get was £7.84 billion.  On 21 October last the European Commission sanctioned £7.2 billion.  Given the shameless double counting of the 1993 figures and the obvious need for their exclusion &mdash; we are talking about a plan for 1994-99 &mdash; we will at best receive £6.1 billion.  The Government's performance with these declining figures &mdash; £8.6 billion, £7.84 billion, £7.2 billion and £6.1 billion &mdash; resembles the voting pattern of the judges at the Olympic skating rink, with particularly poor marks for technical ability and artistic impression.</P>
    <P>This bogus plan with its false assumptions remains critically under-funded.  I have heard reports of &ldquo;funny money&rdquo; solutions.  It has been suggested that the <Col N="207" /> National Treasury Management Agency will raise money on the bond market. We have been told by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, that famous bulldog, that the deferral of projects for seven months is all that is required to keep the plan intact.  Another rumour relates to an increased private sector contribution.  When this is decoded it means fewer headage grants for farmers in disadvantaged areas, a lower percentage of aid for forestry and industry programmes and, worst of all, the hidden agenda of Labour Ministers to introduce a training levy on employers to fund programmes which include the cutting of nettles.</P>
    <P>The national plan is not a clear-cut strategy to improve economic competitiveness, efficiency and output.  It is a patchwork quilt of political and social pet projects.  There has been no focus on value for money, only an adherence to what the Taoiseach calls &ldquo;visual flagships&rdquo;. Areas of economic development such as tourism, marketing, telecommunications, research and development have been underfunded already in this plan and there is no basis throughout the plan for a return on investment.</P>
    <P>The Government's adherence to the hope that the mid-term review in 1996 will make up for the shortfall of funds represents more of this wishful thinking. A new Commission will be in place then. The other Cohesion states of Spain, Greece and Portugal will not be caught flat-footed as they were in the last tranche of funding.  The Portuguese plan of £11.5 billion has already been approved in full. The Irish share per capita does not provide a comparative logical basis for additional funding for Ireland.</P>
    <P>This attitude of &ldquo;it will be all right on the night&rdquo; has not yielded one extra penny for the Irish people and is unlikely to do so.  Instead, it reflects poor political judgment and incompetence.  It is an exercise in pretence and creative accountancy and will result in more own goals for this Government.  The Government ignored advice from officials at home and in Brussels.  As one wit said <Col N="208" /> over the weekend, &ldquo;At the end of the day we will probably owe them money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the handling of this issue the Government has shown itself to be riven with dissension and unstable under pressure. Its disunity and division has resulted in a lack of ability to give priority &mdash; that was the real failure of last week &mdash; to the parts of the plan in need of development and those that needed to be dropped. The only acceptable response from the Government is to set out a timetable for a transparent alteration to the plan which is implementable, practical and realisable. Only then will it remain for the Government to do the decent thing, to offer a humiliating and preferably grovelling apology to this House and the people for bungling and mishandling the affairs from the inception of this Government.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Fine Gael.  This debate is about the shrinking billions but, unfortunately, we have not seen any shrinking violets. We have the Taoiseach putting his foot firmly in his mouth; we have the suave Tánaiste going to Brussels and assuming that the same charisma he displayed in the last election will work as if somehow that would carry him through in regard to errors in his statements of how meetings were handled in Brussels.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take this House on a nostalgic journey, not back to May 1992 when the Taoiseach had progressed from a quarter page to a half page so that later he would eventually achieve the ability to cope with one page but to 12 April 1989 when this House debated the last National Development Plan.  I remind the House what the then member of the Opposition, <Col N="209" /> Deputy Quinn, and indeed his party Leader, now Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, did during that debate.  The Labour Party moved the following amendment:</P>
    <P>condemns the failure of the Government to consult Dáil Éireann on the National Development Plan prior to its submission to the European Commission on March 31st; resolves to amend the Plan by taking into account the contributions in the Dáil debate of April 12th-April 14th 1989 inclusive. Dáil Éireann further instructs the Government to establish, on a formal and legal basis, the seven sub-regional working groups and their advisory bodies, so as to provide for an open democratic forum which would actively engage the energies of local and regional community groups throughout the country.</P>
    <P>They were fine sentiments expressed by Deputy Quinn.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have consistently asked this Government &mdash; and I would include also all of the Opposition parties here &mdash; to consult with us and publish in advance of the 31 March deadline the proposals they were preparing so that whatever would go to Brussels would, in so far as possible, have the maximum amount of political support...</P>
    <P>He highlighted the inadequacies of the Government plan and the inadequacies of the democratic role of the Opposition parties.  He said:</P>
    <P>It is above the petty politics we sometimes engage upon in this political arena and should be bigger than all of us; yet the Government have consistently refused to provide for a democratic political forum which is at the very outset of the philosophical thinking which produced the idea of social cohesion...</P>
    <P>His contribution at that time is riddled with requests to the then Government which clearly, in the passage of time, <Col N="210" /> have been forgotten by him.  He even castigated the Taoiseach by saying:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not have to insist, and if he did insist at any European Council meeting, then he did enormous damage to this country and to his credibility by insisting that we should get something we already have.</P>
    <P>He had the audacity at that time, considering what happened in recent weeks, to criticise the Taoiseach and accuse him of lacking in credibility and ruining Ireland's reputation by daring to question or challenge something at EU level.  How quickly he forgot about that when he went off to Brussels in the past few weeks and damaged Ireland's credibility.  He went on to say: &ldquo;If we had this debate on a draft document in January or February we would have reinforced the negotiating position of every Irish Minister asking for funding...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many of those quotations speak for themselves.  How quickly the Labour Party can change its clothes and its thinking when it moves from the Opposition to the Government benches and partakes in what were considered to be the quite reasonable attributes of Government such as a ministerial car and a driver.  The Labour Party Ministers went way beyond that; they got their mobile telephones, advisers and a range of specialists to help them to forget the kind of sentiments expressed in this House when the last national plan was debated.</P>
    <P>My nostalgic journey brings me now to 14 April 1989 when Deputy Spring, spoke in the Dáil.  He said: &ldquo;The Taoiseach said that there would be a debate, but the understanding was that it would take place when there would be time to make a contribution to the plan&rdquo;. I heard that expression from this side of the House quite recently.  Why did the Tánaiste not remember that he had asked for that and provide this House with the possibility last September to debate this plan before it went to Brussels?  He also said:</P>
    <P>If we are interested in the concept of democracy and allowing elected representatives <Col N="211" /> and local groups to make a contribution to the development of the country, we would want to look very critically at the mechanisms and processes we have employed in the preparation and the development of this plan.  For the record I said that the regional development plan to be published the following day was a sham and that the Government were doing a considerable disservice to this country...</P>
    <P>Those words have perished with the sands of time.  The people who are now in Government have totally forgotten that they made those statements in this House castigating the Government in 1989.</P>
    <P>The remarks of which I most want to remind the Tánaiste are to be found at column 1687 of the Official Report of 14 April 1989.  He said then:</P>
    <P>When we have a further opportunity in the Dáil to question the so-called plan, we will be seeking to have it replaced by one which includes real projects properly costed and funded. The reality is that this plan, albeit a grandiose plan, is not worth one penny if it cannot stand up to the independent and rigorous scrutiny which the EC will apply.</P>
    <P>I wish the Tánaiste had remembered those remarks because that is precisely why we find ourselves in our present position. This Government, including the people who made these statements on the initiation of the National Development Plan 1989-93, chose to forget that their programmes and projects, as the Tánaiste said, would have to stand up to the independent and rigorous scrutiny which the EC would apply.  The Tánaiste went on to call on the then Government to take the necessary policy decisions so that this country could avail of probably what was the most important intervention.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remind the House what those men said at that time and also perhaps the Minister for Finance present who I note has been left all alone in his <Col N="212" /> glory, not a single Minister to support him.  Where is the Tánaiste now?  Where is the Minister for Enterprise and Employment?  Is he off making apologies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or is he putting salve on his wounds?  We know that last week he was utterly demeaned when he emerged from his meeting with Commissioner Bruce Millan because the journalists knew what had taken place at that meeting from their sources, yet the Minister emerged and pretended that all was the same.</P>
      <P>My nostalgic journey moves on to 5 May 1992 when we were debating the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 in the House to allow for the holding of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, said at column 162 of the Official Report of that day:</P>
      <P>...so that we could reasonably look forward to receiving roughly £6,000 million between 1994 and 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; £6 billion in four years, my goodness, that was a lot of money then.  Various speakers in the course of that discussion urged the Government not to base the Maastricht debate on whether we would or would not get £6 billion at that stage, that the debate was much more serious than that.  Of course, the Government at the time wanted to piggy-back on those kinds of promises.  That would have been fine had it rested there but, of course, it did not.  The Taoiseach then went off with his bags packed to Edinburgh, returned and announced £8 billion over seven years; it was growing, changing before our very eyes.  Now the inference on the part of the Government is that, because the Taoiseach returned from Edinburgh in December 1992 and upped the ante, of course implying that he had it &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;&mdash; to quote him &mdash; he did Ireland a great service.  It was like players in a game of poker: I have a royal straight flush; have you something better than that? <Col N="213" /> This is what they are now endeavouring to say, that by upping the ante to £8 billion we eventually got £7.2 billion.  Did one ever hear such an argument?  Nothing would shake the Taoiseach from that figure of £8 billion.  Yet in July 1993 the Tánaiste returned with £7.84 billion.  The very next day President Delors used the &ldquo;L&rdquo; word &mdash; which, in deference to you, a Cheann Comhairle, I will just refer to as such &mdash; essentially President Delors indicated that the Tánaiste was economical with the truth of what we would get from the Structural Funds.  He spoke about the &ldquo;fourchette&rdquo;, endeavouring to get across to us that we should not take as gospel the £7.84 billion, that the policy of the &ldquo;fourchette&rdquo; was still working.  Perhaps it was that Ministers at that time had not studied sufficient French to understand the significance of the word &ldquo;fourchette&rdquo;. By golly, they know what it means now because that fourchette has certainly damaged them over and over again. Indeed I am sure they have some sore parts as a result of that fourchette having been prodded at them since then; I do not want to ask where they might be hurting.  But President Delors said: Be warned, there is not going to be this amount.</P>
    <P>The subterfuge continued throughout the summer.  The Dáil was not sitting so it was easy for Ministers to make statements outside the House when they could not be questioned in here.  Ministers engaged in their summer tours, attended summer schools and paraded the £7.84 billion.  Then, in September 1993, we heard from the Government that the plan was ready, that they were obliged to submit it to Brussels poste haste, otherwise they would miss the post, as it were. The Opposition, Fine Gael in particular, called for the Dáil to be recalled so that we, the Opposition, who wanted to support the Government, as the present Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said on 12 April 1989 &mdash; so that any plan that went to Brussels would have the unanimous support of all Irish elected parliamentarians &mdash; could debate the plan.  That is why he called for the debate back in <Col N="214" /> 1989.  How quickly he forgot.  We requested that the House be recalled but, of course, our request was refused.</P>
    <P>On 10 October 1993 the Government submitted the £20 billion worth of a plan, £8 billion of Structural and Cohesion Funds included therein.  In July 1993 we were told the figure was £7.84 billion.  Yet the Government did not even have the decency to scale it down to that figure, they sent in our application for £8 billion, which was, I think to save the Taoiseach's face because he had already done the £6 billion trick in May 1992, the £8 billion trick in December 1992 and could not lose face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you do, yes, you have to cast your net somewhat farther, and the Government submitted a plan for £8 billion.  Eleven days later the news broke that the &ldquo;fourchette&rdquo; was still operational, that the range was now going to be £7.2 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened on Sunday last to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, on the radio.  Talk about post-hocery and post-justification.  The Minister for Finance having come into this House last week and told us there would be no changes, that there was no need, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications had the gall to say: but we knew back in October last it was £7.2 billion; what is all the fuss about?  The Government did nothing about that information; they did not have the guts to come in here or announce anywhere that they were now going to trim down the plan so that &mdash; to quote Deputy Spring at the time &mdash; it can stand up to the most independent and rigorous scrutiny the EC will apply.  One would think they were a crowd of fools over in Brussels, that they could not add up and calculate that our proposals amounted to £8 billion from the Structural Funds, that they were offering £7.2 and, in between, there was a difference of £800 million.  I would remind the House that they have calculators, <Col N="215" /> they are still not working on their fingers over there; they can actually calculate over in Brussels, they are not mere civil servants, they are the highest quality civil servants each country can provide.  To think that one could get away with pretending that this was not going to happen is beyond comprehension.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications say on Sunday last: we knew about this.  I say to them: in the name of God why did not they do something about this and not leave us out to dry with officials in Brussels and everywhere else?  I want to say to the Minister for Finance present that my firm information from Brussels &mdash; he knows it and, I hope, will admit it this evening &mdash; is that there is no way that an 8.5 per cent trim can succeed.  I do not know how many Members present make apple tarts, but it would be as if one took one's knife and trimmed a bit of pastry off all the way around, a little bit here and a little bit there.  If the plan is being scrutinised because of its content, taking 8.5 per cent off a programme being scrutinised for content, which will not really be approved, will be of no use to the officials examining this project because taking a bit off something of bad content is not good enough.  I warn the Minister for Finance that in the changes needed in this National Development Plan he and his Government had better not adopt the line of least resistance by deciding in Cabinet, behind closed doors &mdash; but with all these leaks &mdash; that they will adhere to the programmes and projects irrespective of whether they are as they should be &mdash; adding to the true capacity of this country as opposed to just &ldquo;income transfers&rdquo;&mdash; because, if so, he will not be cutting programmes or parts thereof based on the fact that he cannot cut or change others, because Ministers have given excessive promises to their constituents, to their various sectoral bodies.</P>
    <P>Already we have heard of one Minister saying at meetings in his constituency it is wonderful news that we have to trim down and that the projects not included the first time will now be included <Col N="216" /> because some of the others will be excluded.  Can anyone imagine a Minister of State advocating that?  Projects will be cut in places such as Dublin where there is not a strong or cohesive lobby because a Minister in another part of Ireland has made excessive promises and will raise his fist or have a histrionics attack in the middle of a Cabinet meeting.  I appeal to the Minister to tell us tonight what he will do and let us have no more subterfuge.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann, recognising the major contribution to jobs and to Ireland's economic potential arising from the substantial investments to be made with EU Structural Funds and associated public and private expenditure, supports the strategy and priorities set out in the National Development Plan 1994-99 and supports the Government in its discussions with the European Commission on the Community Support Framework 1994-99 to ensure maximum return for Ireland from this expenditure&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I start by setting out the overall background against which this debate is taking place.  At the European Council in Edinburgh in December 1992, the Government achieved a major success in the level of resources that the Council agreed should be provided for the four cohesion member states &mdash; Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland &mdash; through the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund over the following seven years to 1999.  The benefits of the new Cohesion Fund have already been seen in the additional investments in the areas of transport and the environment that <Col N="217" /> became possible in 1993.  This was followed by the further achievement of securing over £7 billion as Ireland's share of these increased resources.  While this is less than had been hoped for as a starting point, it is still a very substantial result and represents easily the largest block of aid ever secured by an Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Over the seven year period concerned, Ireland will receive the highest level of EU aid per head of population of any member state.  Aid to Ireland will amount to approximately IR£2,100 per person, compared with approximately IR£1,700 in the case of Greece, IR£1,650 in Portugal and IR£1,400 in Spain.</P>
      <P>I will turn now to the latest position.  It is important to make the position clear in relation to certain key issues.  Discussions are underway currently with the European Commission on the National Development Plan 1994-99 with a view to agreeing the Community Support Framework, which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The way the system works is as follows. The national authorities decide their development strategy and on the basis of this put forward their proposals for expenditure in the structural area, including the use of the Structural Funds and domestic resources, in the development plan.  This plan is then discussed with the European Commission and on foot of those discussions the Community Support Framework is agreed.  The Community Support Framework will set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the development objectives, the priorities adopted for Community assistance and the indicative financing plan.  Following adoption of the Community Support Framework, the operational programmes are approved.  These set out in more detail the objectives and measures for each of the main sectors. The programmes are the legal basis for the commitment of EU aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about projects and, in particular, about which projects will or will not go ahead.  I have described the different stages of the process, that is the development plan, the Community Support Framework and the <Col N="218" /> operational programmes.  None of these deals with individual projects.  They are concerned with the broader levels of programmes and measures.  Only a small number of individual projects are even mentioned in the National Development Plan and the same will be the case in the Community Support Framework.  Comprehensive lists of projects do not exist at this stage and we are not discussing individual projects with the Commission, apart from a few major projects which have to be treated separately from the programmes.  The selection of individual projects is a further phase following the approval of the operational programmes. Project selection is a process that will continue right through the implementation period.  We cannot say now what projects will be implemented in 1997, 1998 or 1999.  This is how the system worked under the previous Community Support Framework also and it is how the system works in other member states.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure proposals which will be aided under the Community Support Framework 1994-99, Ireland's plan includes investments to be aided by the Cohesion Fund, to be aided under Structural Funds Community initiative programmes and to be aided under the EFTA Cohesion Fund in the 1994-99 period.  These are governed by different administrative procedures from the Community Support Framework and are not part of the current negotiations.  The plan also includes eligible national structural expenditure not proposed for EU aid and 1993 expenditure, including 1993 EU aid.</P>
    <P>In addition to 1994-99 expenditure, the plan also includes 1993 expenditure including EU aid.  This is to give a complete picture, arising from the increased Community resources, since the new Cohesion Fund came on stream in 1993.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan was prepared and submitted on the basis of a certain projected amount of EU aid under each of these headings &mdash; the Community Support Framework, the Community initiatives and the Cohesion Fund.  Subsequent to the submission of the plan, on 21 October 1993, the European Commission made decisions on the <Col N="219" /> allocation of resources to member states and specifically on the allocations to the Community Support Frameworks for the Objective 1 regions, including Ireland. The allocation approved for Ireland under its Community Support Framework was 5.62 billion ECUS or IR£4.54 billion.  This amount fell short of the amount which had been included in the plan in respect of the Community Support Framework element.</P>
    <P>This shortfall was recognised and acknowledged by me and by the Government from the outset.  It is important to distinguish here between two different issues.  The Community Support Framework has to be agreed now on the basis of the EU aid which has been allocated by the Commission at this stage.  Accordingly, adjustments have to be made to the expenditure allocations to take account of the shortfall.</P>
    <P>However, it remains the Government's belief that, over the six year period to 1999, it will be possible to do better than this and to get additional EU aid over and above the allocations already made up to 1999.  This is a legitimate aspiration which one would expect to be shared by all Members of the Dáil.  It is also a realistic aspiration in the light of our experience in the past.  The possibility of increasing the allocation during the period has been recognised by the Commission. President Delors was the first person to draw attention to the potential of the mid-term review at the time of the October decisions.  Is it really the position of the Opposition that as of now we should completely write off the mid-term review, as far as any benefit for Ireland might be concerned?  We will continue at every stage to try to maximise the aid coming to Ireland and that is our duty.</P>

      <P>As I have said, however, the Community Support Framework has to be agreed on the basis of the aid now available.  It has been suggested, both in the Dáil and outside the House, that this issue has only been <Col N="220" /> addressed by me and the other members of the Government in the last week.  This is not the case and I want to make the record clear on this.</P>
      <P>At the press conference on 9 December on the 1994 Estimates I said, &ldquo;the indicative allocation of Structural Fund aid for Ireland for the period 1994-99 made by the Commission on 21 October is less than the figure on which the National Development Plan was based&rdquo;. I also said at that press conference that this shortfall in EC aid, &ldquo;has been taken into account by the Government in settling the 1994 Estimates and Public Capital Programme.  The assumption underlying the PCP and the Estimates is that Exchequer and EC spending in areas covered by the Plan will be £130 million less than the Plan projections&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was fully reported in the press at the time.  I would draw Deputies' attention to the headline in the business section of <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 10 December 1993 in which Mary Canniffe correctly reported that the 1994 Estimates showed a shortfall in European aid of £170 million.  Thus, a full three months ago, I acknowledged that there was a shortfall and I made the first set of adjustments to take account of it in respect of 1994.  More recently, in a radio interview I did likewise.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the adjustments which the Government proposes to make to the expenditure allocations in the Community Support Framework.  Since the plan was submitted in October there have been extensive discussions between the various Government Departments involved and the Commission services. These were on an informal basis at first as the Commission services were still engaged in internal consultations before arriving at an overall Commission approach to the Community Support Framework.  The discussions moved into a more formal phase with the first formal meeting in Dublin on 18 February 1994 and have continued since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset, the Irish side in these discussions has made clear that the National Development Plan represented a set of strategies and priorities carefully <Col N="221" /> chosen by the Government and that we would want to see the basic shape of the plan reflected in the Community Support Framework.  This view was restated at the opening of the formal discussions on 18 February 1994.  Last week the Government confirmed this essential position in deciding that its position was that the total expenditure provisions in the plan should be adjusted on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to take account of the shortfall in EU aid.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that these adjustments are not sufficient and that there have to be further cuts.  This is not the case.  The total EU contribution to be included in the Community Support Framework was settled last October.  It is not at issue in the present discussions. The adjustments put forward by the Government deal fully with the shortfall in EU aid.  Lest there be confusion about the size of the cutback needed, the Government is looking at the cut in overall expenditure, including the Exchequer and the EU assistance.  Higher cuts mentioned by others tend to relate only to the proportionate cut in EU aid.  The end result is the same no matter which basis is taken.  There is no question of the matching Exchequer funding being cut back in addition to the EU aid.  The Exchequer input will be at least maintained.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have been furiously trying to create the impression that the Commission has major problems with the plan or that there is some possibility of the plan being rejected.  This is totally incorrect.  The Commission has accepted the strategy set out in the plan.  The ongoing discussions are about some of the detail.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to look back at what Opposition Deputies said in 1989 in relation to the previous National Development Plan.  To take some examples from newspaper reports, Deputy Alan Dukes said that the plan was &ldquo;inadequate, ill-conceived and vague&rdquo;.  Deputy Noonan said that &ldquo;the Cabinet would now be forced to drop about £1 billion worth of projects from the National Plan and he called on them to say quickly which ones will not be <Col N="222" /> going ahead&rdquo;.  Deputy De Rossa said that &ldquo;the plan was so fundamentally flawed that it stands every prospect of being rejected by the EC Commission&rdquo;.  He also said that &ldquo;the Government's handling of the application had been incompetent and inept&rdquo;, words used again this evening.  Deputy McDowell said that the plan was &ldquo;a piece of propaganda&rdquo; and &ldquo;an abject failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What happened?  The Community Support Framework was successfully negotiated with the EC Commission.  The strategies, priorities and measures put forward in the plan were reflected, with little change, in the Community Support Framework.  Implementation of the Community Support Framework was carried through extremely successfully, now universally acknowledged.  It has been the subject of independent evaluation with very positive results reported.  The European Commission has also recognised the success of that Community Support Framework and, not least, we received £3.4 billion.</P>

      <P>My Department notified other Departments of adjustments to their Structural Fund allocations on 28 February.  The Government considered the matter the following day and decided that instead of the approach of my Department, allocations might be adjusted on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis subject to the possibility of securing increased funding at the mid-term review of the programme.</P>

      <P>The discussions with the Commission are continuing.  Naturally, there are issues on which the Commission requires clarification and areas where it has suggestions for adjustments to improve the overall effectiveness of the measures proposed in the plan.  This is not an adversarial process; we view it rather as a constructive one.  To the extent that the discussions between the Government Departments and the Commission services can refine and improve the measures in the plan it is all to the good.  Thus refinements may be needed but we expect these to be largely at the margins or within particular expenditure areas, with the Community Support Framework reflecting the overall strategies and priorities identified in the plan.</P>
      <P>Since the overall shape of the proposals in the plan will remain unchanged, the expenditure adjustments will mainly affect the timing and rate of progress of the various measures in the plan and when additional EU aid becomes available over the period, the pace will be readjusted again.  We did this the last time and will do so again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission services are, of course, concerned to ensure that the best return is obtained from the Community funding.  This view is shared fully by the Government.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil last week, I do not intend to get involved in commenting on any of the details of the discussions as they progress as it would be neither helpful nor appropriate.  As I said, it could give rise to distortions with relatively minor issues being blown out of proportion and unnecessary alarms being created.  The Community Support Framework, when agreed, will be published. There is another important point to remember in this context.  Of the total Exchequer expenditure included in the National Development Plan which would be eligible for EU aid, not all will be aided by the EU.  Some substantial elements will be financed exclusively by the Exchequer because, with the percentage EU aid rates that apply, there is more than enough total Exchequer expenditure to absorb all the EU aid.</P>
      <P>The ongoing discussions are primarily about how the EU aid is to be allocated across the total expenditure package. Therefore, if it turns out that less EU aid than expected is allocated to one measure with an increase in the net Exchequer cost of that measure, this can be balanced by higher EU aid and a net Exchequer saving elsewhere.  Adjustments of this nature would have no net effect on expenditure totals or on the overall Exchequer cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the motion by Deputies Bruton, Owen and Yates raises the issue of the impact on the Exchequer of the adjustments which will be made in the Community Support Framework.  This is an issue on which, as Minister for Finance, I should comment.  The Government is firmly committed to maintaining budgetary discipline and to a fiscal policy set in the framework of the Maastricht convergence criteria.  For this reason, as I already pointed out, adjustments were made in the 1994 Estimates to take <Col N="225" /> account of the shortfall in EU aid.  Further adjustments will now be made in the Community Support Framework to deal with the situation for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In the 1994 Estimates reductions of £130 million were made to plan expenditure. This was not the full amount of the projected aid shortfall.  It was possible for the Exchequer to meet some £40 million of a cost which the plan envisaged would be met by EU funding.  That will depend on the Estimates each year.  The Government would, however, regard it as imprudent to commit inself at this stage to significant further increases in public expenditure, without having regard to the economic and budget position which will apply each year.</P>

The Government is in a position to make decisions and has influence in Europe and at home.  Its decisions will be supported by people of influence here and in Europe.  The Opposition has created a climate where it almost wishes that we will not get the money.  The reality is that we are getting a greater amount of money than any country ever received before.

    <P>There is general acceptance that there will be a reduction but there is an opportunity to review the plan in accordance with the commitment given by the Commission and M. Jacques Delors.  In that event, is the Opposition suggesting we should not try to get additional money? Should the Government, united with the Opposition, not try to get the greatest possible level of funding from the European Union?  Is it not more important that we make the best possible use of any money we get?  Should the Government go cap in hand to Brussels and say it is sorry for asking for so much and it intends to make cutbacks to the projects?  The Opposition would then say the Government had promised the light rail link, <Col N="231" /> corridors from the south to the west, and the commissioning of the Tallaght hospital.  The Tallaght hospital is being built in spite of the Opposition.  The Opposition would be the first to criticise the expenditure of public money to build the hospital.  We started it and we will finish it.  The problem is that the Opposition knows that as well.  We will also carry out the major programmes in the plan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on a number of points the Minister made in his speech either in this debate or in some other forum.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions for reply today to ascertain what we were seeking for the period 1994-99 at 1994 prices.  I was anxious to discover what the starting point was in the current negotiations between the Government and officials in Brussels.  The Minister gave some of the figures tonight.</P>
      <P>Under the Community Support Framework in the period 1994-99 we will receive £4.54 billion at 1994 prices. Under the Community initiatives which have not been finalised we should receive at least £400 million, with some variations, at 1994 prices and £1 billion approximately from the Cohesion Fund which has also not been finalised at 1994 prices.  Taken together, in the relevant six year period we will receive £5.94 billion at 1994 prices.  That is the figure on which we are working.</P>
      <P>The Minister said tonight that the adjustments are sufficient and no more cuts will be required.  It was reported last week that a cut of 8.5 per cent was required.  The Minister or the Minister of State should clarify which figure was cut by 8.5 per cent.  While he did not concede that the cut was 8.5 per cent the Minister said the Government is looking at the cut in overall expenditure, including that of the Exchequer and European Union assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sought £6.824 billion at 1994 prices for the National Development Plan.  The gap between the figure mentioned by the Minister in his reply today and the amount sought for the plan is £884 million. I am confused as to which figure has <Col N="233" /> been cut by 8.5 per cent which would give one an answer of £884 million.  I would like that clarified.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that for every £1 provided by the European Union we were to provide £2.50 by way of public and private sector investment. The gap in the figures for the National Development Plan in the relevant six year period is the equivalent of £884 million multiplied by 2.5.  If there are to be no further cuts which figure has been cut by 8.5 per cent, if the reports are correct?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Martin and Ferris and the Minister that of all the Cohesion countries we have got the best deal.  The reason this debate is taking place is that the triumph has been shattered and obscured by the myth that surrounded it.  That is the reason the Government has found itself offside.  I stand over the contention that even before the plan was published the message was conveyed in no uncertain terms at Commission level that the mythical figure was not going to be made available. We engaged in an exercise of selfdelusion to the extent that we knew that the figures were unattainable.  This led over time to a triumph being turned into failure and a débâcle.  It was an act of selfdeception and we continued to propagate that act over time.</P>
    <P>Several new elements &mdash; I will not call them deceptions &mdash; which might deceive, confuse or obscure, have crept back into this debate.  One way of extending the old myth is to extend the timescale, and say that if we cannot finish on time we can drift for another year or two.  That can be done with any plan, but extending the timescale is extending the myth itself rather than relating to the timescale of the plan and the realistic figures that are available and sticking with them.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister compared the amount this Government got from Europe with amounts negotiated by past Governments and said what a great Government this is to have got what it did.  Funding from Europe is the exclusive preserve of our negotiators.  It requires that financial perspectives be agreed by the Twelve within which we <Col N="234" /> negotiate our slice, and it is not a triumph of any Irish administration that the funding went up.  The funding increased significantly when the European Union implemented the Single European Act and agreed to double the amount of Structural Funding at the time.  It was a decision of the Twelve.  When we agreed to the Maastricht Treaty we agreed again on a substantial extra layer of Structural Fund resources and the new Cohesion Fund.  The Twelve delivered that.  It is a falsehood to suggest that it was either a triumph of one administration or a failure of another.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Owen's criticism of the Labour Party and her excursion through the records.  I can only recall a very elegant remark by Deputy Brian Lenihan on the futility of consistency. The Labour Party is establishing in Government that it subscribes to the Lenihan philosophy that to be consistent is futile.</P>
    <P>I have doubts about the mid-term review the Minister referred to, but I do not express these doubts in an antagonistic way.  I hope that if there is a mid-term review the Government and the nation can prosper from it.  However, the financial parameters within which Europe can spend up to 1999 were settled at Edinburgh.  Although that may change in money terms because of inflation or adjustments in the exchange rate, there will not be more resources overall.  Whatever extra we would hope to get must arise by way of others not getting or not using what might have been theirs.  That may happen, and good luck to us if we can benefit from it, but although not impossible, it is of a low order of probability.</P>
    <P>I am greatly amused at the Minister's saying that President Delors was the first person to draw attention to the potential of the mid-term review at the time of the October decisions.  Indeed he was.  He was also the person who stuck the <i>four-chette</i> into this Government's mythological bubble at the same time.  Jacques Delors, whom we are now citing as the saviour signalling the way forward in the <Col N="235" /> mid-term review, who could not deliver as President of the Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>He delivered a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not deliver what the Government thought was in the bag, but perhaps he never thought it was in the bag.  We now cite Jacques Delors as being able to predict how well we will do in the mid-term review when the same Jacques Delors will not even be there as President. When he was President he could not deliver what we thought he had delivered, but when he is gone we want to believe he is the fountain of all wisdom as to the prospects in the mid-term review.</P>
      <P>We love confusing the public with numbers because it is so easy to change base years, inflation rates etc. and no one ever knows what we are talking about. However, what we will have in the bag when the whole process is finished will be fixed at 1994 constant prices, subject to inflation or exchange rate adjustments over time.  That will produce more in money terms in the future than any current suggestion might suggest, but in real terms it will not be one ECU more than the real base on which it is set in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another myth is that when we add everything up in 1997 or 1999 we will have proved our worth and the total will not be £6.1 billion or £6.8 billion but £7.84 billion or whatever.  That may be so if inflation is high and there are significant exchange rate adjustments.  However, the £2.86 billion of the last time, which we say grew to £3.4 billion, did not grow by magic or by mirrors; it grew because £300 million came from inflation and exchange rate adjustments and about another £200 million came from Community initiatives subject to the same adjustments.  There was no magic, no mirrors, no inside track and no horse trading.  That is why I draw attention to these creeping elements of mystique that the timescale will be out a little and the mid-term review will be our saviour &mdash; Jacques Delors told us that and he ought to know.  That we got much more by 1993 <Col N="236" /> than we thought in 1989 is part of the same mythology.</P>
    <P>I am glad &mdash; and I give this much credit to the Minister for Finance &mdash; that slowly but surely in recent weeks the Minister has begun to demythologise, at least in finance terms, some of the elements that the Government still vigorously defends. I refer to the demythologising of some of the figures.  As the Minister pursued the inevitable logic of cutting down in the 1994 budget, his Government insisted on continuing the mythology of the £8 billion or the £7.2 billion or whatever.</P>
    <P>I will finish as I began by remarking that this has been a major achievement in the lifetime of this Government, a major contribution to European solidarity and to economic and social cohesion by our fellow member states in the European Union.  All that said, the reason it has been an embarrassment for the Government for so many months is that we turned the reality of the triumph, through myth, nonsense, bluff and bluster, into a political debacle and a failure. That is why this debate is taking place. Members of the Opposition need not apologise for having a debate on this issue and the Progressive Democrats will vote in support of the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  There are ten members involved in the St. Brendan's group water scheme in Ballygar, County Galway.  It is a small scheme involving five householders and five landowners.  Will a supplementary grant be paid towards the scheme or, alternatively, will the Minister announce an increase in the grants available for group water schemes because there is a shortfall of £15,000 for the Ballygar scheme?  I understand that £3 million has been allocated in the Department of the Environment for <Col N="237" /> group water schemes in 1994, but schemes will not proceed if supplementary grants are not paid or if grants are not increased.  Those grants constitute £700 for each householder and £500 for each landowner and are inadequate to deal with the increased cost of group water schemes.</P>
      <P>The allocation of £3 million for 1994 is a small figure compared to that in 1982 when £8 million was allocated for such schemes mainly from FEOGA funds.  I urge the Minister to secure European funds for such schemes now.  More than 100 are awaiting approval in County Galway, St. Brendan's is only one of them.  In other words, 2,500 houses in Galway do not have an adequate water supply.  This is an issue of major concern in Galway, particularly in my constituency. Will the Minister indicate if approval can be given for the Ballygar scheme?  It is one of the smallest schemes and cannot proceed unless the shortfall is bridged by either a supplementary grant or an increase in the grants for houses and landowners.  I hope the Minister has positive news for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this issue.  This proposed scheme will serve nine houses and five farms.  It is designed to connect to an extension of the Ballygar public water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>The area to be served is close to the town of Ballygar and is likely to undergo further development.  For this reason, Galway County Council has recommended upsizing the distribution system to cater for the future development needs of the area.  This would involve the laying of larger, more expensive water mains as well as increasing the capacity of the sump from 2,250 gallons to 7,000 gallons. These recommendations mean that the scheme would now cost considerably more than originally planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated cost of the revised scheme is approximately £33,000.  As the number of grant eligible houses and farms is relatively small, grant income only amounts to £9,500 or less than 30 per <Col N="238" /> cent of overall cost.  The revised scheme is not economically viable on the basis of standard group water scheme grants and the group has sought a supplementary grant of around £20,000 from the provision for public water and sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt will be aware that the detailed arrangements for water and sanitary services schemes generally, including group water schemes, are being reviewed in the context of the operational programme for environmental services, now under preparation.  It will take some time to finalise these arrangements.  No specific commitments can be made with regard to the funding of group schemes such as St. Brendan's until the overall funding arrangements for public water and sewerage schemes have been decided for the period.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's concern that the scheme should proceed at the earliest date possible is appreciated and will be borne in mind in the further consideration of these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath comes from Ballymore and I live in Ballynacargy. Moyvore and Ballymore are only a few miles up the road from where I live.  The whole area is bereft of industrial development.  The absence of a water supply undoubtedly hinders the best and earnest efforts of the local community groups to initiate developments to bring worthwhile projects to this large geographical area.  The current unemployment rate is approximately 25 per <Col N="239" /> cent, one in four persons are out of work. Accordingly, all obstacles hindering progress in that unemployment blackspot should be removed immediately.</P>
      <P>The immediate approval by the Minister's Department of the tenders submitted for this scheme will remove the biggest barrier to siting projects in our area.  This is how industrialists perceive the appalling water supply.</P>
      <P>There is no mains water in Ballymore or Moyvore or in the rural areas proposed to be served by the scheme which forms part of the major water scheme for the central areas of Westmeath known as the Mullingar regional water supply scheme. The overall scheme, based on Lough Owel as its source, has been divided into five sections, some of which have already been developed.</P>
      <P>The north low level section &mdash; the section I am now requesting the Minister to approve &mdash; consists of an expansion of the trunk main systems from Bunbrosna to serve the rural area in the north-western front of the county, together with towns and villages en route, such as Ballynacargy, Moyvore and Ballymore.</P>
      <P>I briefly refer to Ballynacargy because I live in the heart of the village and can give a first-hand account of the water supply in this area.  The water supply in Ballynacargy needs to be improved in terms of quality and quantity.  The source is also vulnerable &mdash; it is a river which can be subject from time to time to foreign matter being placed there.  The supply is variable, with occasional breaches of drinking water regulations as set down by EU legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system for which tender approval is now sought is designed for a future population of over 3,500.  It will allow for future development as well as permit the expansion of other towns and villages in the area which has been hindered by the absence of a piped supply.  The scheme will also help provide the conditions necessary for the development of agriculture and industry in the area.  This is a mixed farming area and a reliable water supply is vital to agriculture.  I understand a group scheme is ready to start in Ballymore, <Col N="240" /> but is unable to do so because of the lack of a piped system of water.</P>
    <P>Tender reports were sent to the Minister's Department on 20 June 1991.  It is almost three years since they were submitted, and it is vital that the Minister ends the uncertainty for the people of the area, and indeed Westmeath County Council, by giving approval for the tender submitted in June 1991 and allow this much needed scheme to commence without any further procrastination or delay.</P>
    <P>It would be a major boost to these three picturesque villages, serve as the necessary impetus to get some industry into the area and help to tackle the huge unemployment problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time with me and compliment him on raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose mentioned his home village of Ballynacargy.  My home village is Ballymore and I wish to impress on the Minister the importance of extending a water supply to that village where there is a thriving community.  It has a marvellous community centre built with little outside help.  There is an excellent sewerage system in the village which I am sure is unique in Europe in that there is no mains water supply.  The system is adequate for the village but it cannot be utilised to the full because of the lack of a proper water supply.  That supply has been promised to the people of Ballymore and Ballynacargy for a long time and they have been told they are at the top of the priority list but, unfortunately, no work has been done.  I hope the Minister has good news for us tonight.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputies Penrose and McGrath for raising this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed scheme is designed to extend the Mullingar regional water supply to serve a large area of Westmeath currently without a public water supply; this area includes Ballynacargy, Moyvore and Ballymore.  The scheme will provide a high quality water supply for public and <Col N="241" /> group schemes in the area and will serve domestic, agricultural and industrial uses.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, considerable progress is being made in County Westmeath in the provision of water and sanitary services.  Contracts 2 and 3 of the Athlone main drainage scheme now nearing completion are estimated to cost £8.6 million.  The Athlone scheme provides secondary treatment for the town of Athlone and environs and will eliminate the existing polluting discharges to the River Shannon and enhance it as a high class amenity.  In addition, the Castlepollard sewerage scheme, costing £2.4 million, the Kinnegad sewerage scheme costing £1.2 million, and an extension of the Mullingar sewerage disposal works costing £1.95 million, have all recently been completed.</P>
    <P>Contracts 2 and 3 of the Athlone regional water supply to extend the scheme and provide additional water storage are also at an advanced stage of planning.  This high level of broadly based investment in County Westmeath is clear evidence of this Government's commitment to meeting the objectives of the environmental action programme and satisfying urgent local requirements.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan provides for expenditure in excess of £600 million for the period 1994-99 on environmental services.  The provision for this year alone is an all-time high of £122 million.</P>
    <P>This level of investment clearly demonstrates the Government's continued commitment to the provision of good quality drinking water and the elimination of pollution blackspots.  I am aware of the need for the north western low level section of the Mullingar regional water supply.  Tenders for the scheme have been submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>The question of funding is being considered in the context of the 1994-99 operational programme for environmental services.  Preparation of this operational programme is well advanced and <Col N="242" /> it will of course have to target areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that until the operational programme has been completed, it will not be possible to indicate the priority of specific schemes.  The case which the Deputy has made will of course be borne in mind in the further consideration of these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for granting me permission to raise the question and I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>For more than 150 years the Patrician Brothers and their teachers have provided an outstanding educational service to generations of young Galwegians who attended St. Patrick's National School in the city.  An essential element of the broad education of life given at the Patrician Brothers' school was having a seventh class to prepare the boys well for entry into the secondary school system. Numerous testimonials exist from grateful parents expressing appreciation of the value of attendance at the seventh class in that school.  Time permitting I will refer to some of those testimonials later.</P>
      <P>There are 579 pupils attending the school, 18 teachers, two special teachers and a principal.  There are four sixth classes in the school with a total of 140 pupils and approximately 70 stay on each year for a further year to attend seventh class and approximately 44 pupils are taken on at the special request of parents of children attending mostly rural schools around the city.  At present there are 114 pupils in seventh class made up of three classes of 38 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of seventh class has existed in that school for the past 150 years.  That class has traditionally catered for three distinct categories of pupils: children who have failed to achieve an adequate level of literacy and numeracy which is critical to their further education; children from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds who have greater than usual difficulty <Col N="243" /> progressing through the primary school cycle and children who are too young and emotionally ill-prepared to progress and integrate successfully at second level.</P>
    <P>Four years ago, the Department of Education informed the board of management that the provision of seventh class should end in June 1990.  After discussions with the Department a phasing out period of four years was granted. In the intervening period, because of parental demand, Brother Robert Ruane, the principal, reluctantly agreed to increase the number of seventh classes in the school from two to three to accommodate increased numbers demanding placements in those classes.  Despite repeated appeals and representations from parents and teachers to rescind the decision arrived at in 1990 and allow the seventh classes to continue, the Department of Education refused to alter its decision. The chairperson of the board of management, Brother Marcus, was informed on 1 March last that the seventh classes should cease at the end of the current school year.</P>
    <P>I consider that to be an educationally regressive decision by the Coalition Government.  The Minister, who is a teacher, should know the transition between the child-centred primary education system and the more academically orientated secondary system can be difficult and traumatic for children with learning difficulties.  The new curriculum purports to allow children to progress at their own pace.  Automatic and compulsory progress to second level makes nonsense of this ideology when it is evident that children are not ready.</P>
    <P>While one can agree in theory with the Department's policy that all children should progress to second level after eight years in the primary cycle, this only holds true in ideal circumstances.  The reality is that not all children are ready to advance to second level for a multiplicity of educational, psychological and social reasons.  One of the most trenchant arguments for a seventh class year is that it allows flexibility in the system and gives a vital chance to those children who do <Col N="244" /> not have an adequate basis in literacy and numeracy and children who are young or immature and provides a much needed opportunity to make transition to secondary cycle easier.  Unsought testimonials from parents over the years reinforces that point strongly.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education argued that with the introduction of a six year cycle at secondary level that the need for a seventh class is eliminated.  However, the proposed transition year is not available in all schools at present and is in most cases a post-junior or leaving certificate year.  This is too late for children who for one reason or another are struggling in the first and subsequent years of the secondary school cycle.</P>
    <P>Historically, there has always been a demand for a seventh class and at least one seventh class has been in operation in that school for 150 years.  Since the population boom of the 1970s, and probably also due to increased pressure on children to achieve high grades at second level, St. Patrick's school has under pressure, provided a second seventh class.  Since 1991, again due entirely to demand from parents outside the schools normal catchment areas the principal, Brother Robert Ruane, has provided a third seventh class.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Brothers National School, since the closure of St. Brendan's, is the only city centre school in Galway.  It caters for the school-going populations of the vast sprawls of local authority housing estates on the west and east sides of the city.  A significant number of students from those disadvantaged areas do not achieve potential in literacy and numeracy by the end of their primary schooling. Seventh class has been an ideal opportunity to redress that.</P>
    <P>Article 42.1 of the Constitution states that parents have the inalienable right and duty to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.  Parents, as the primary educators, should have the option of allowing their children to do a further year at primary level should they deem it necessary for their child's education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> It is a retrograde step to abandon a system that has worked so well and proved educationally successful down through the years.  In view of my cogent arguments I ask the Minister to reconsider her decision.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the Deputy the position in relation to the promotion of pupils to a seventh class and the related matter of retaining pupils in sixth class. In 1967 my Department issued a circular to the management authorities of all primary schools.  This circular clearly outlined my Department's policy in the matter of the promotion of pupils in national schools.  The circular stated:</P>
      <P>...the normal procedure (for the promotion of pupils in national schools) should be that a pupil is promoted to a higher standard at the end of each school year.  There may be cases where the principal teacher feels that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for second year in a class.  In regard to such cases it is felt that by reference to educational principles they should be minimal: that no pupil should be held back for longer than one year throughout his national school career.</P>
      <P>A further circular was issued by my Department in 1989 which reaffirmed my Department's policy in this matter.  In this latter circular it was stated:</P>
      <P>Having regard to Government policy that all children should have the opportunity of having three years post primary education before reaching the minimum school leaving age, Boards of Management are reminded of the terms of Circular 10/67 in the matter of the promotion of pupils in national schools.  School authorities should ensure that the promotion and retention of pupils in their schools will have regard to the principles set down in that Circular.</P>

    <P>In regard to pupils who have completed sixth standard in a national <Col N="246" /> school, it would be in accordance with accepted practice that they transfer to post primary school.  Accordingly, consideration can be given to their inclusion as eligible pupils for staffing and other purposes for a further period in a national school only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Deputy will accept that there can be no ambiguity about my Department's policy in these matters.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific case of St. Patrick's national school, the position which developed there is that over the years my Department's policy and guidelines concerning the promotion of pupils have not been implemented.  As a result, from staffing and provision of resources perspectives, the school has enjoyed considerable advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> schools which implemented my Department's policy.  I am anxious to ensure that all schools are treated in the fairest possible way.  Accordingly, I will not permit schools perpetrate inequalities by disregarding my Department's policies.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that the management authorities of St. Patrick's school were granted a concession in 1990 whereby the school was allowed to retain a seventh class for an additional four year period.  That decision was not taken by this Government, but it allowed for a phasing out period.  The basis for that concession was to allow the school to take the steps necessary to phase out the practices of promoting pupils to a seventh class or allowing pupils to repeat sixth class.  In the circumstances, requests for additional time to phase out the practices cannot be considered.</P>
    <P>I would make one additional point. The national school curriculum is designed as an eight year programme with provision for an infant's programme of approximately two years duration followed by six years in standards I to VI. Accordingly, there is no approved course of study for a seventh class.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy believes that as a teacher I am not aware of the educational arguments in favour of seventh class. While the practice has been going on for <Col N="247" /> a long time, perhaps for the 150 years the school has been in existence, matters are quite different now in that there is in place the junior certificate programme, the offer of a transition year and three options in the leaving certificate.  It would be much more beneficial for the student to avail of at least three years of a junior certificate programme before reaching the mandatory school leaving age.  For those reasons and the fact that two circulars have been issued to this school giving notice of the phasing out period, I cannot agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the cost of reducing the pension age from 66 to 65 would be in the region of £25 million to £30 million per annum and this would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  If such a change were to be made <Col N="47" /> it would have to include both contributory and non-contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> has recommended that a standard qualifying age of 65 for retirement and old age pensions should be introduced.

      <P>Social welfare legislation requires that, in order to qualify for a deserted wife's benefit a number of conditions must be fulfilled.  One of these is that if a woman is under 40 she must have a child dependant or dependants.  This condition has applied since the introduction of deserted wife's benefit in 1973 on the basis that a woman under 40 with no child dependents would not have the same needs as those in the same position with children.  The condition is designed to ensure that resources are targeted at those most in need.</P>
      <P>A woman who does not qualify for a deserted wife's benefit payment may qualify for other social welfare payments such as unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance subject to the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are not entitled to deserted wife's benefit under Irish legislation but who have worked in a number of European Union member states may have insurance in another member state taken into account under EU regulations on <Col N="48" /> social security for migrant workers in order to qualify them for benefit.</P>
    <P>It has recently been decided that deserted wife's benefit is a family benefit under those regulations and that, as a consequence, social insurance contributions in another member state may be taken into account in determining entitlement to deserted wife's benefit in certain circumstances.  Family benefits as a general rule apply only where there are family dependants.</P>
    <P>Arising from the decision that desterted wife's benefit is covered by the European Union regulations a number of difficult issues have been raised concerning the precise effect of this, including the application of the decision in cases where there are no dependent children. These issues are being considered at present and as soon as they have been resolved I will be in touch with the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>The new widower's contributory pension is a significant break-through in the development of our social insurance system.  It is by far the most significant measure to be introduced in social welfare since I extended social insurance to the self-employed in 1988.  It also marks a major step forward in providing support for families where the wife has died.</P>
      <P>The pension will be available to widowers on the same terms and subject to the same contribution conditions as currently apply to widows.  Over 9,000 widowers will benefit from this first time scheme which is being introduced at a very substantial cost of some £27 million in a full year and over £6 million this year.</P>
      <P>As this is a new scheme, it is being implemented in October rather than July.  This will allow for the administrative arrangements to be put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent years have seen a growing importance of self-employment in the construction sector.  The result of this change in working patterns has given rise to extensive use of the C2/C45 system. These are forms issued by or on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  To qualify <Col N="50" /> for a C2 a sub-contractor's tax and PRSI affairs must be in order.  If the sub-contractor does not have evidence of C2 status, the contractor is required to deduct 35 per cent of any moneys paid to sub-contractors as a retention tax and sends this money to the Revenue Commissioners. For those not holding C2s, the main contractor gives the sub-contractor a form, C45, which sets out the gross amount of money to the sub-contractor as well as the amount deducted for tax, and the amount actually paid to the sub-contractor.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent controversy in relation to the issues which are raised by the use of these forms in the construction sector.  I have arranged for a review of the operation of the system and its implications for the social welfare system.  I can confirm that the review will involve consultations with the trade unions concerned and with representatives of employers as well as with the Revenue Commissioners and other interested State bodies.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the Revenue Commissioners will be asked to take measures to ensure that the C45 system is applied only to genuine sub-contract situations. Revenue will discuss the matter with my Department to see if procedures can be strengthened further.  In addition the black economy monitoring group will be asked to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 scheme and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the scheme generally.  Pending the outcome of the review, the Revenue Commissioners will take measures to prevent the C45 system being applied where PAYE would be the appropriate system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I am concerned that moves from employed to self-employed status should be genuine and not simply devices to avoid the payment of employers' social insurance contributions thus leaving workers without vital social welfare cover when, in reality, the employer-employee relationship is still in existence.  The whole question of determining between employee and self-employed <Col N="51" /> status is a complex one and is surrounded by a considerable body of case law.  My Department decides on these matters on a case-by-case basis taking into account previous interpretations of the courts on the nature of employment.</P>
    <P>My concern is the possibility that sub-contractors may be left with insufficient cover in the event of an accident on the construction site.</P>
    <P>It was this concern that prompted me to provide in the Social Welfare Bill at present before the House for regulatory powers under which entitlement to certain occupational injuries benefits may be extended to categories of workers not covered at present for those benefits.  It is my intention to use the regulatory powers to extend occupational injuries benefits to workers whose work arrangements have changed in recent years requiring them to become sub-contractors, and thereby insured for PRSI pensions only, rather than remain as workers insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  It is my intention that changes in working arrangements in the construction industry will receive particular attention.</P>

Where an applicant and his household has income in excess of £5 per week in addition to his contributory social welfare income he will not qualify for a fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992, S.I. No. 152 of 1992, were introduced to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period or delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7.  The delay in implementing the directive meant that during the period December 1984 to May 1986, married women received a lower personal rate than other claimants in the case of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit.  During this period married women received a maximum of 12 months unemployment benefit as against 15 months in the case of claimants generally.  During the period December 1984 to November 1986 married women were not entitled to claim increases for adult and child dependants except in exceptional circumstances and they were not entitled to claim unemployment assistance, other than in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide for payment of increased rates of benefit, extended duration of unemployment benefit, increases for dependant in the form of a household supplement and unemployment assistance.  The legislation provided for the payment of arrears on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Claimants with potential entitlement to arrears were identified from my Department's records and were issued with claim forms in mid-1992.  A total of 86,400 claims were received and of those 70,500 were entitled to payment.  All arrears due were paid in 1992 and 1993. The final phase or arrears due was not due to be paid until 1994.  However, as <Col N="56" /> the Deputies no doubt are aware I made special arrangements for the arrears due under this phase to be paid before Christmas last.  A small number of claims are still being received and these continue to be processed.</P>
    <P>As I have made known on several previous occasions, a number of court proceedings were initiated seeking retrospective payments, in some cases as far back as 1985.  In the absence of implementing measures, settlements were made in eight such cases.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the retrospective legislation, legal proceedings have been initiated seeking payments over and above those provided for in the retrospective legislation.  I have repeatedly stated that these proceedings are being defended by my Department and ultimately the matter will be determined by the courts.</P>

      <P>Social welfare recipients who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional weekly payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Entitlement to payments of a diet supplement is determined by the health boards by reference to standard costed diets.  The supplement paid is in respect of the additional cost of the special diet over and above the amount a person would be expected to pay for a normal diet.  Where a recipient of a diet supplementary receives an increase in income, for example through an increase in social welfare payments, the value of the supplement is recalculated and may be reduced as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be reviewing the operation of the provisions of dietary supplements under <Col N="57" /> the scheme during the coming months. In this connection I understand that the Eastern Health Board has established a committee to review the payment of diet supplements and that the recommendations of the committee will be presented to the board shortly.  I will take account in the context of my review of the conclusions of the board in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1992 as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government introduced the Community Employment Development Programme (CEDP).  Projects were set up in twelve pilot areas known as &ldquo;PESP Pilot Areas&rdquo;.  It was agreed at that time, on an administrative basis, to allow a special tax exemption to facilitate the pilot scheme.  It was never intended to be long-term in nature.</P>
      <P>At the close of the pilot period, the experience with the scheme gave rise to serious concerns that a wide scale tax exemption to participants of CEDP projects could give rise to distortions within the tax system.</P>
      <P>I would point out that persons whose sole income is derived from the CEDP will not, in many cases, be liable to income tax as their tax free allowance will exceed their income.  The extent to which tax will actually arise on CEDP payments will, in many cases, depend on the level of other taxable income a participant has in a particular tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to income set aside for child minding expenses being assessable for income tax purposes I would point out that there are no measures in the tax code which allow persons to deduct such <Col N="64" /> expenses from their income for tax purposes. I could not agree to introduce such a general tax concession as it would be very costly to the Exchequer in terms of revenue foregone which would have to be made up elsewhere.  Furthermore were such a measure introduced it would undoubtedly lead to cognate demands from other taxpayers for reliefs for other personal expenses which in equity would be hard to resist.</P>
    <P>In addition to introduce such a measure would clearly lead to a narrowing of the tax base which would run counter to stated Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 49, 50, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware the allocation of resources to Ireland falls within the range 8.1 to 9.3 billion ECU in 1992 prices.  Converting to Irish pounds and to 1994 prices, this is equivalent to a range of IR£6.9 billion to IR£8 billion.  In October 1993, the Commission decided the amounts on which it would negotiate Community Support Frameworks (CSFs) for the disbursement of the Structural Funds in the period 1994-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amounts do not cover all the resources in the range because 1993 <Col N="66" /> Structural Funds resources were already allocated and Community Initiatives and Cohesion Fund resources are dealt with separately.  While the overall EU aid contribution under the Community Support Framework has been settled, the year by year phasing of that aid has still to be finalised.</P>
    <P>Community Support Frameworks are broad statements of priorities and commitments and the indicative amounts of Community assistance contained in them may be subject to adjustment during the implementation period.  For Ireland, the CSF amount expressed in 1994 prices is 5.62 billion ECU or IR£4.54 billion.  The equivalent figure included in the National Development Plan is IR£5.3 billion.  As regards Community Initiatives no allocations to member states have yet been made.  The Plan projected that Ireland might receive the equivalent of IR£524 million in 1994 prices from Community Initiatives.  The Government consider that Ireland will receive at least IR£400 million in aid under the Initiatives in the period 1994 to 1999.  Cohesion Fund resources over the period 1994-1999 are expected to be in line with the figure included in the National Development Plan at over IR£1 billion in 1994 prices.</P>
    <P>In relation to 1993, EU aid commitments to Ireland amounted to £845 million from the structural funds under the Community Support Framework 1989-1993, £122 million from the structural funds under Community Initiative programmes and £114 million from the Cohesion Fund, all in 1993 prices.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for reinstatement in the Civil Service in 1990 but her application was not successful as she did not meet the statutory criteria for reinstatement contained in section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973.  This is the only statutory authority for the reinstatement of women to their former positions and it was clearly intended as a limited exception to the general rule that entry to the service is by way of open competition only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that application was dealt with, the Labour Court, in response to a complaint made by the Employment Equality Agency, has determined that the statutory provisions in question are discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment.  The Court recommended that the provisions be repealed. The Labour Court Determination has <Col N="68" /> recently been challenged in the High Court by means of judicial review and further action concerning the repeal of the provisions has been deferred pending the outcome of that review.</P>
    <P>Of course, the person concerned may seek reappointment to the Civil Service by means of the open competitions which are held by the Civil Service Commission at various levels from time to time.  The raising of the upper age limits for these competitions in 1991 &mdash; the maximum age for most competitions is now 50 &mdash; has facilitated the return of married women to the Civil Service by this means.</P>

      <P>The current employers' PRSI exemption scheme, introduced in September 1992, is an incentive to employers to provide full-time job opportunities for unemployed people who are taken on from 19 October 1992 to 5 April 1994. Subject to certain criteria, employers are exempted from paying the employers share of the PRSI contribution in respect of new employees for up to two years for the tax years 1993/94 and 1994/95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 4,700 applications have been received for the existing scheme and 4,000 unemployed people have been employed to date under the scheme. Information on the number of employees still at work under the scheme and on the amount of employer's PRSI foregone <Col N="69" /> is not available at present.  An interim assessment cannot be carried out until late this year when the end of year records for the 1993-94 tax year have been processed.  Employers can benefit from the existing scheme up to 5 April 1995.  A full assessment will be carried out in late 1995 when the end of year records for 1994/95 have been processed.</P>
    <P>In view of the success of the current scheme in creating job opportunities for the unemployed, I have recently announced as part of a PRSI package aimed to generate new jobs, a new PRSI exemption scheme for the tax years 1994/95 and 1995/96 in respect of new jobs created for unemployed people before 6 April 1995.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this measure will make a worthwhile contribution to the Government's wide-ranging efforts to combat unemployment.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years of age or over as well as certain incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel for eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Those include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-state companies such as Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnrod Éireann, as well as services provided by certain private contractors.  The scope of the free travel scheme has been expanded over the years both in relation to the number of routes covered and the concessions made available to people with disabilities such as the free travel companion pass which I introduced in 1990.  About 440,000 people qualify for free travel at a cost of around £30 million a year.</P>
      <P>The question of further extensions of the scheme to include the use of alternative forms of transport by people with disabilities or people living in remote areas is limited by the financial implications which this would have.</P>
      <P>In recognition, however, of the special difficulties of people in remote areas, I was glad to be able this year to make a grant of £30,000 to the Forum project in North West Connemara for a pilot transport project aimed at the needs of elderly people and others in isolated rural areas.  I will consider the results of the pilot project in the context of any further developments of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the rate of £54.10 per week based on a means assessment of £79 per week, derived from self-employment.</P>
      <P>He requested a review of his means. The review has been completed and he has been assessed with weekly means of £138, derived from self-employment and a small amount of capital.  The revised assessment will be effective from 9 March 1994.</P>
      <P>As the revised means exceed the maximum rate of assistance payable in his case of £133.10 per week he will not be entitled to assistance from 9 March.</P>
      <P>The person concerned does not satisfy the contribution conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit, in particular, he does not have the necessary 39 paid or credited contributions in the relevant contribution year 1992-1993.  Self-employed persons with income in excess of £2,500 per annum are insured under the social insurance system for old age and widow's pension purposes and pay a contribution at the Class S rate.  They are not covered for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is intended to provide an employee with a replacement income in the event of involuntary loss of employment.  An employee, by definition, supports himself-herself through earnings from employment.  Loss of employment in such a case generally occurs as a result of a decision by the employer and the person is therefore in need of income maintenance.  This is supplied through unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In the case of a self-employed person, the overall income position rather than the week-to-week earnings is the relevant factor in regard to his-her need for income maintenance.  The position of such a person between jobs would not be regarded as unemployment in the sense in which that term applies to employees.</P>

As I informed the House on 19 October last, I asked the Garda authorities for a full report following the receipt of correspondence in which certain allegations were made relating to the incident in question.  I have received a report and I have asked the Garda for additional clarification on a number of issues which will allow me to complete my detailed consideration of the report. At that stage, which I hope will be in the near future, I propose in the first instance to respond to representations which have been received from a legal adviser acting on behalf of the persons concerned.  I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <P>I understand that Garda response to automatic alarm activations from the premises referred to in the question was discontinued on 7 July 1993, in accordance with the terms of the Garda <Col N="79" /> Policy on Intruder Alarms.  The policy was introduced with effect from 1 September 1992, with the aim of reducing the level of false alarm activations by getting the owners of premises to take the remedial action necessary to improve the operation of their alarm systems.  In recent years false alarms had accounted for approximately 94 per cent of all alarm activations notified to the Garda.  This involved very substantial waste of Garda time and resources and diverted those resources from geunine alarm calls and other calls for Garda assistance.</P>
      <P>Prior to 7 July 1993, I understand that the company in question had 27 false alarms recorded against them, far in excess of the level permissible under the Garda policy.  As a result the company were informed by the Garda that response to alarm activations would be discontinued as from 7 July 1993, and would not be resumed until there had been a period free from false alarms which is not normally less than three months.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that from 7 July 1993, to date, there have been a further 23 false alarms, which again is far in excess of the level permissible and does not justify a resumption of service to the company.</P>
      <P>I understand that the company mentioned have spent a considerable amount of money and effort in trying to eliminate the problems.  Nonetheless, the figures show that they still have a major problem with their alarm system, which needs to be addressed urgently.  The Garda, therefore, are not in a position to resume the service at this time but they will co-operate fully where possible with the company in correcting their problems.  I understand that arrangements have been made for the local Crime Prevention Officer to call on the proprietor and try to advise him on how his alarm system can be used to his advantage, with a view to resuming Garda response at the earliest possible date within the terms of the Garda Policy on Intruder Alarms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the interest not only of the Garda but also of the company that this <Col N="80" /> alarm system functions properly and that the level of false calls coming from it is not such as to make it ineffective as a crime prevention instrument.</P>

      <P>Many complex factors need to be taken into account in performance evaluation of public sector bodies and, ultimately, it is difficult to avoid at least some element of subjectivity.  There is, <Col N="84" /> therefore, little to be gained by attempting formally to categorise individual local authorities in terms of overall performance.</P>

Specific matters arising relating to individual programmes or services are taken up with the local authority concerned as they arise.

      <P>I met city and county managers on 25 February 1994 to review the position on the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads, which the Government and I regard as a priority. My primary objective was to ensure that the State grants provision of £101.4 million for these roads in 1994 (an increase of 35 per cent on last year) together with the substantial expenditure from local authorities' own resources, would be used to best advantage.  To this end, I stressed that the overall funds available, estimated at £162 million this year, should be allocated to work which will ensure value for money and give lasting <Col N="85" /> benefits in terms of road conditions.  I mentioned also the potential for greater community involvement on the repair and maintenance of local roads, whether through contributions in money or kind, in the light of the experience of counties where pilot projects have operated successfully.</P>

      <P>Rathmullan Pier is in the charge of Donegal County Council which is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the structure.  The Department of the Marine will, depending on funding available, provide assistance to local authorities for capital development projects in the fisheries interest.  Aid will not be provided for normal maintenance works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> The Department is updating its Fishery Harbour Development Plan for the period 1994 through 1999.  All maritime local authorities have been invited to make a formal submission to the Department detailing proposals for harbour developments in the fisheries interest. Donegal County Council's submission lists Rathmullan Pier as its first priority for development.  The council's proposal includes strengthening the pier and providing a slipway at a cost of approximately £3 million.</P>
    <P>In view of the level of funding which is likely to be available over the period of the plan, only the most economically and strategically beneficial projects will be undertaken.  Therefore all proposals are being fully assessed by the Department. The inclusion of any project will be dependent on this assessment and on the agreement of the Commission of the European Communities who are subventing the plan's implementation.  Until these matters are finalised I am not in a position to indicate what work can be undertaken at Rathmullan Pier.</P>

      <P>An application to divide this commonage was received in the local Land Commission office in Castlebar early last year.  As a result a Land Commission inspector contacted the shareholders with a view to assisting <Col N="96" /> them in preparing a scheme to divide the commonage.  At a recent meeting of the shareholders to discuss the division two of the seven shareholders were still undecided as to whether they were in favour of the division and a third shareholder did not attend the meeting.  The Land Commission is willing to provide technical and legal assistance in the voluntary division of this commonage but they cannot do this until the shareholders reach agreement on the question of division.</P>

He did not submit the cattle identity cards for stamping and punching prior to selling the animals in question as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme and consequently lost entitlement to the premium.

      <P>In compliance with EU regulations 79/65/EEC on the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) family farm incomes are estimated by Teagasc in its National Farm Survey.  This annual survey relies on a random sample of 1,400 farms, where accounts are kept under the supervision of Teagasc personnel, to represent approximately 160,000 family farms. These accounts are then analysed and the results published each year giving estimates of input costs and output prices for different categories of farms.  The results of the 1993 survey are not yet available.</P>
      <P>From the survey Teagasc estimate that average family farm income for 1991 was £5,955 and for 1992 £7,172.  It must be noted that, as is pointed out in the survey, this includes part time and full time farms and does not take account of off-farm or land rental income.</P>
      <P>A full picture of farm household income, both from farm and off-farm sources will be provided by the 1994 Household Budget Survey by the Central Statistics Office which will start this year. Results from this survey should become available during 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain parts of the country will always be more attractive than others as tourist destinations, primarily due to natural features.  However, the important issue, is to exploit the real tourism potential <Col N="112" /> that exists in all areas of the country. My policy is geared towards achieving this end.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>National Development Plan,</i> 1994-99 the Government has had regard not only to potential for further tourism growth but also to the contribution that this growth can make to regional development within Ireland.  Many of our major tourist attractions and most of our scenic routes are located in remote areas of great natural beauty with little prospects for industrial or farming development but which can enjoy the benefits of an expanded tourist industry.  My Department is at present preparing a new operational programme for tourism 1994-99, which will ensure that each region will benefit significantly from the scale of investment being proposed.  I am aware that other Departments are also preparing operational programmes in areas such as rural and local development which will impact positively on tourism potential in the regions.  A second round of Community Initiatives are planned and further programmes like LEADER and INTERREG, which are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance respectively, will also benefit regional tourism development.</P>
      <P>The restructuring of the tourism organisations at regional and county level which I carried out last October will enhance the role of the perceived &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; tourism areas.  New County Tourism Committees have been set up and will be involved in the &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; development of tourism at county-area level.  They will primarily be responsible for stimulating and co-ordinating projects in the tourism sector by identifying, influencing and bringing forward new products and initiatives in their operational area; and formulating county tourism sector plans for incorporation into the County Enterprise Boards' action plans and the RTO's plans.</P>
      <P>The recent budget contained a number of measures that will impact positively on tourism, including the allocation of £5 million for tourism promotion and development programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> To a large extent tourism is industry-led. My main responsibility is to ensure that the optimum support framework is in place in terms of its structures, the fiscal environment and grant aid.  I will, of course, be receptive to any suggestions that might come forward through the Tourism Council or elsewhere on further measures to develop tourism in the weaker areas.</P>

      <P>The job-sharing scheme for the health service was introduced in 1985.  The terms of the scheme provide that the operation and maintenance of job-sharing arrangements are a matter for the management of each health agency and must necessarily depend on the demands of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent annual Health Services Personnel Census carried out by my Department shows that there were 2,526 nurses employed throughout the health service in a job-sharing capacity at 31 December, 1992.  This represents nearly 9 per cent of the total nurses employed. The position in the voluntary hospital and the health board sectors reflect the overall position for the health service as a whole.  Thus 678 or 8.5 per cent of nurses in the voluntary hospital sector and 1,693 or 9 per cent of nurses in the health board sector were employed in a job-sharing capacity at 31 December 1992.  Information on job-sharing numbers in the third non public hospital category sought by the Deputy is not <Col N="118" /> available as my Department has no responsibility for employment policy in hospitals in that category.</P>
    <P>The increasing success of the job-sharing scheme in the health service in providing both an attractive alternative to full-time working arrangements and greater employment opportunities for nurses can be gauged from the following figures which show the annual increase in the total number of nurses availing of the scheme for the period December 1989 to December 1992.</P>

I recently wrote to the chief executive officers of the health boards exhorting them to adopt as flexible an approach as possible in relation to accommodating staff wishing to avail of the scheme.  Within the context of overall personnel policy for the health services for 1994, details of which will be circulated to health agencies soon, it is my intention to emphasise the positive aspects of the job-sharing scheme and to ask each health agency to make every effort to ensure that the opportunities for greater participation in the scheme that exist are fully exploited.</P>

      <P>The accident and emergency departments of the six major hospitals in Dublin operate a 24-hour service.  The dressing clinic at the Mater Hospital is located within its accident and emergency department. The Mater Hospital has advised me that it has been necessary on recent occasions to cancel the dressing clinic at short notice due to the number of patients attending the accident and emergency department and also due to the number of patients awaiting admission to the <Col N="120" /> hospital from the accident and emergency department.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Mater Hospital that, in urgent cases, patients have been advised to return to the accident and emergency department to have dressings changed and, where possible, patients have been referred to their local health centres.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital is at present examining the situation with a view to relocating the Dressing Clinic to another location which would be in close proximity to the Accident and Emergency Department.  The hospital is also examining the feasibility of providing additional observation beds at the Accident and Emergency Department.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital Accident and Emergency Departments at any particular time. However, at all times, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may arise it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the Accident and Emergency Departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem of this type.  In December 1993, following further discussions, I allocated an additional £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the Accident and Emergency Hospitals to be eased.  This was achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six major A &amp; E hospitals in Dublin, who were no longer in need of acute hospital care, in step-down accommodation more appropriate to their condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change which I announced recently in relation to the charge for attendance at Accident and Emergency Departments is intended to create an <Col N="121" /> incentive for patients to attend their general practitioner in the first instance, in cases where their condition would be most appropriately treated at this level. I am hopeful that this change will help to ease the pressure on hospital Accident and Emergency Departments.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the Accident and Emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 163 together.  Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, which came into effect on 1 October 1992, placed a statutory duty on health boards to make suitable accommodation available to homeless persons up to the age of 18 years.</P>
      <P>At the time of its commencement my Department informed the health boards that the placement of youngsters in bed and breakfast accommodation was not acceptable, except in an emergency where a suitable placement was not readily available.  In such cases the health boards were asked to take immediate steps to secure an appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for the child.  The directive issued by the Western Health Board to its staff is fully in keeping with these instructions.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate plans to amend these instructions, which I believe are a reasonable and pragmatic approach having regard to the current state of development of our services for homeless youth.  It is, however, my intention to devote additional resources to this area, from the £15 million available this year for child care, to expand the number of hostel, residential and family placements and thereby reduce the reliance on bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>

      <P>I have not been made aware, nor has my Department, of difficulties being experienced by children from the areas referred to by the Deputy in gaining entry to any of the four second level schools in Swords.</P>

    <P>Intake policy is essentially a matter for each post-primary school management subject to the application of acceptable criteria.  My Department's primary objective is to ensure that all the schools in a catchment area have between them adequate provision to meet the demand from pupils in that particular area.  I am <Col N="129" /> satisfied that this requirement is being met for the area in question.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for disadvantaged area status.  Schools are selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic criteria.</P>
      <P>Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's Inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools and their prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>At present under this scheme, a total of 258 primary schools have the services of 275 additional ex-quota teaching posts. The schools in question also receive supplementary capitation grants at the rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
      <P>As I recently announced in the context of the 1994 education budget, I intend that a further 50 primary schools will be designated as disadvantaged for capitation grant purposes in the current year. The case of the school mentioned by the Deputy will be fully considered in this context.</P>

      <P>There are 69 Gaelscoileanna, which have been approved by my Department, operating in the State.  My Department is fully committed to facilitating and supporting the establishment of Gaelscoileanna. Where a demand for such a school is demonstrated, and there is no alternative within a reasonable distance my Department, subject to certain conditions, will sanction a new Gaelscoil. Practical support for Gaelscoileanna is further demonstrated through the payment of increased capitation grants for pupils in these schools, allowing a more favourable pupil teacher ratio compared with ordinary primary school, and paying allowances to teachers who teach through Irish.  Furthermore, my Department provides 100 per cent of the cost of site acquisition and the provision of new buildings or extension/renovations to existing building for Gaelscoileanna.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation, there is no distinction made between television sets used as monitors for videos and those used to receive television programmes. Any provision to exempt schools from the requirement to purchase television licences would require a change in present legislation, which would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Officials <Col N="131" /> of my Department are having discussions with the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht at present with a view to examining the possibilities of granting such exemption to schools.</P>
      <P>The costs of purchasing television licences are part of the normal running costs of schools, which are covered under the scheme of capitation grants.  In this regard, I would remind the Deputy that I secured a further increase in this grant for 1994, and I will continue to seek improvements to this grant as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The total allocation to my Department <Col N="132" /> in respect of sporting activities in 1994 is £17.275 million, which represents 19.58 per cent of the surplus from the national lottery.</P>
      <P>An additional £3 million from Exchequer funds was also allocated in the recent budget to the recreational facilities scheme.  This brings the total funding for sport to £10.275 million this year.</P>

      <P>Special grants are available to sporting organisations towards the staging of international events held in Ireland.  Significant progress has been made in the provision of sports facilities in Ireland. Examples of this include the development of major regional indoor and outdoor centres in Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Nenagh and Limerick; the development of Morton Stadium as the National Athletics facility, the national basketball arena in Tallaght, the badminton centre in Baldoyle and the new hockey facility in Belfield, which is currently under construction.</P>
      <P>The development of high standard indoor and outdoor sports facilities, for use by Irish sportspeople and for the staging of national and international events, is a key elements in the Government's policy for sport.  The success of the policy of providing this infrastructure can be seen from the number of major international events to be held in Ireland this year.  These include the ladies' hockey world cup, the world handball championships, European youth soccer finals, European promotions basketball cup and the international boxing challenge.  The men's European hockey cup is due to be staged in UCD, Belfield in 1995.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1993, I met a deputation from Dunboyne which included representatives of the Local Action Committee to discuss the provision of a second-level school in Dunboyne.  I also received correspondence from this group concerning the matter, including the issue of the preferred type of school for the area.  The primary concern expressed by the Action Group was that a school <Col N="135" /> would be in place by September 1994 &mdash; they did not indicate undue concern about the type of management structure the school would have.</P>
    <P>I did not personally meet members of County Meath vocational education committee to discuss proposals for a new school in Dunboyne.  However, officials from my Department recently met a sub-Committee of the vocational education committee to discuss arrangements for the opening of the school in temporary accommodation next September.  I am most anxious that the school will commence operations in September in view of the fact that a significant number of parents in the Dunboyne area were unable to obtain places for their children in existing schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>The Finglas Children's Centre has two distinct facilities, St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Unit and St. Laurence's Industrial School.  The centre, which opened in 1972, is owned by the State and has been managed on behalf of my Department by the De La Salle Order since that time.</P>
      <P>St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Unit is registered under the Children Act, 1908 as a Place of Detention and is certified as such by the Minister for Justice.  As a place of detention, St. Michael's is required to accommodate male children and young persons referred by the Courts either on remand, on remand for assessment or on one month detention orders. The centre has a capacity to accommodate up to 20 such cases.</P>
      <P>While the main focus of St. Michael's work has been to provide assessments of young offenders where requested by the Courts, the services it provides in meeting the remand needs of the Courts also represent a very important component in the overall provision for young offenders. I look forward to a continuation of this role in the future.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the health boards to determine their role in relation to the provision of assessment services generally. However, I would draw a very clear distinction between any such role and the very specific legal remit of Places of Detention which embraces both a remand, detention and assessment function. I would not see a role for the health boards in this particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the De La Salle Order to withdraw from the management of the Finglas Children's Centre from June next, arose from their unwillingness to continue to adhere to the requirements of the 1908 Children Act under which St. Michael's, as a place of detention, is required to accommodate both remand and assessment cases referred by the Courts.  In effect, the centre had indicated its intention <Col N="137" /> to refuse to accept any further &ldquo;remand only&rdquo; cases from the Courts.</P>
    <P>Strenuous efforts were made by my Department to dissuade the authorities at the centre from embarking on their proposed course.  It was pointed out that my Department could not condone a direct breach of the 1908 Children Act and that my Department had an obligation to meet the requirements of the Courts.</P>
    <P>In the event, the De La Salle Order decided to withdraw from management of the Finglas Children's Centre.  My Department has no alternative, therefore, but to proceed with the necessary arrangements for the appointment of a new management team for the centre.  These arrangements are currently being pursued.</P>
    <P>While the decision of the De La Salle Order to withdraw from the Finglas Children's Centre is very much regretted, the Deputy will appreciate that as Minister with responsibility for the young offender area, I must ensure that the requirements of the law are fully met.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation of the valuable work which the De La Salle Order has undertaken at the centre over many years.  I also want to acknowledge the Order's commitment to co-operate fully in ensuring a smooth transition to a new management team.  I have no doubt that the Order's contribution has provided a most valuable basis for a successful operation of the centre in the future.</P>

      <P>In August 1991 consultants were commissioned to assist my Department in a study to determine the need and provision for post primary school places in the Castleknock-Hartstown- Dunboyne areas.  The consultants recommended the provision of new schools for Hartstown and Dunboyne.  The report of the consultants was confidential to the Department and no agreement was made with them about publication.</P>
      <P>In summer 1993, I decided that the case for a second level school in Castleknock should be reviewed to take account of continuing housing developments in the area and the difficulty some pupils were having in obtaining places in a school within a reasonable distance.  I have accepted the consultants updated report and its recommendation that a new school should be provided in Castleknock.</P>
      <P>Copies of the updated report are available to the local interest groups and public representatives on request from my Department, as provided for in the agreed Terms of Reference of this review.</P>

      <P>The council's views have been carefully considered and most of their requirements have been met.  However, the request that a concrete wall be built on a section of the boundary was regarded as unreasonable and is unacceptable to the Department which considers that a chain-link fence together with fast growing trees and shrubs will provide a satisfactory boundary.</P>
