      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the situation in relation to Ministers of State who are candidates in the forthcoming European elections; if they will be allowed to continue in office in view of the demands of their campaign as well as the proper performance of their ministerial duties; the way in which the demands of the two roles will be reconciled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1984, Ministers of State are not required to resign their office in order to contest the European Assembly elections.  Under the same Act, however, they must cease to hold office upon being elected to the European Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, under our Constitution and under the <Col N="1654" /> Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, Ministers and Ministers of State remain in office and continue to carry out their functions during general elections although, in almost all instances, they are candidates in the elections. In the circumstances, I do not see any reason why Ministers of State should not continue in office while they contest European Assembly elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the two Ministers concerned are declared candidates in the European elections, have they given up their car allowances, expenses and advisory staff?  Would it not be reasonable to expect those allowances to be withdrawn given that there is a possible conflict, or as it is called now &ldquo;a coincidence of interest&rdquo;, relating to their continuing on as Ministers at the expense of the taxpayer and also being candidates in the European Assembly elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The answer to the Deputy's second question is that I do not regard the situation as either a coincidence or a conflict of interest.  The Act, to which I referred in my reply, was passed at a time when the Government Chief Whip of the day was a candidate in the European elections. As in all general elections &mdash; although I am not equating them with European elections &mdash; Ministers and Ministers of State do not resign.  They continue to carry out their official duties and that remains the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Ministers have a large burden of work in their ministries, how can they perform those duties to the satisfaction of the taxpayer as well as travelling through the country on an election campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers and Ministers of State are nearly always candidates in elections and business is carried on as usual.  The logic of Deputy O'Donnell's argument is that if people are not able to do two jobs at the one time as a result of the dual mandate they should resign. <Col N="1655" /> That is the logic of the argument the Deputy is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the same considerations apply in the case of a Cabinet Minister?  What would be the situation if a Cabinet Minister were added to the ticket, say in Leinster for example?  Has the Taoiseach had any success in persuading a Minister to run in the Leinster constituency?  Specifically how is he getting on with Minister Andrews?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte may be surprised to hear that I had not requested any member of the Cabinet to stand for Europe, but if he is concerned about the double obligation, he can consult his leader who carried the dual mandate for quite some time and always said in this House that he could do it adequately.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>the measures, if any, he proposes to take in order to prevent the importation into Ireland of stallions which test positive for equine viral arteritis, EVA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Stallions coming from countries outside the EU must undergo a test for EVA with negative results, prior to export.</P>
      <P>There are common veterinary conditions under which horses may move between EU countries.  At present these rules do not include any provisions in regard to EVA.</P>
      <P>However, I have asked the EU Commission to consider the introduction of EVA pre-export controls on stallions.</P>
      <P>EVA is a notifiable disease which has not occurred in Ireland to date.  My Department has written to all stallion owners asking them to have their stallions tested and they have been advised to follow the recommendation of a code of practice to prevent EVA.  In addition, a regulation is being drafted to control outbreaks of the disease, should outbreaks occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that a regulation is being drafted.  Would the Minister agree that it will be too late at that stage?  Is the Minister aware that there are plans to import an EVA positive stallion from Germany &mdash; I am not sure from where that stallion originated? Would the Minister agree that in our position we are extremely vulnerable to a rapid spread of this highly transmissible disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a resident of County Kildare has purchased and imported a stallion from Germany.  While the blood tests on the animal show EVA anti-bodies they indicate that it has not had recent contact with the disease and does not pose any risk of spread through the respiratory route.  Provided it is not used for breeding the animal does not pose a risk of transmitting the disease. The animal is 18 years old, is intended for dressage use and the owner has given an undertaking that it will not and never has been used for breeding purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to inform the House of the measures taken by the Department to control EVA.  Stallions have been <Col N="1657" /> identified as the most dangerous source of the spread of EVA so the Department has recently written to stallion owners alerting them to the risks of EVA and asking them to have their stallions tested. The test will be conducted free of charge until 1 April 1994 and they are advised to apply the recommendations of the common code of practice on the control of EVA.  Vaccination of stallions has been permitted on a trial basis although as yet there is not an EU approved EVA vaccine.  Notices have been placed in the national newspapers regarding the disease and the EU Commission has been asked to introduce pre-export controls on stallions moving in intra-Community trade.  A regulation to deal with outbreaks is being prepared by a parliamentary draftsman.  In general the Department is well aware of and is concerned about this and other measures are being looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that any regulations we might pass here could affect only the practice as it is carried on here?  Would he further agree that those regulations cannot do anything to resolve the anomaly between the fact that imports of stallions from outside the EU require this certificate whereas imports from within the EU do not?  Will the Minister say what action, if any, the Government proposes to take in order to align controls in the two cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 20, 28, 41, 44, 57, 62, 71, 74, 127, 128 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> The position is that more than 500,000 payments amounting to over £377 million were made to farmers under the various premium and headage schemes in the year ended 31 December 1993.  This compares to total payments of £350 million in the year ended 31 December 1992 &mdash; a record year for payments.  In addition to the £377 million, other direct payments to farmers in 1993 totalled close to £50 million.  The high level of payments to farmers during 1993 was achieved against a background of EU regulations which preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November and even then limit the payments to 60 per cent advances.  Disadvantaged areas' headage payments other than for sheep are normally made on the basis of advances.</P>
    <P>The premium payments situation in Ireland compares more than favourably with that in other member states.  No advance payments of special beef and suckler cow premia were made in several member states in 1993.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications received for the special beef premium scheme for the January-February 1993 and June 1993 application periods in relation to both the ten and 22 month animals is 152,968.</P>
    <P>Advance payments of 60 per cent as provided in EU regulations, of £24.5 million have now been made on foot of 85,000 of these applications.  The bulk of the outstanding cases involve queries and this is slowing the rate of processing.  It is estimated that up to £40 million more will be paid out, including the 40 per cent balances.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there were in the order of 366,000 animals applied on for ten month and 895,000 animals applied on for the 22 month special beef premium for the January-February and June 1993 application periods.  Payments have been made to date in respect of 730,000 of these animals.</P>
    <P>The number of applications made during the November application period is of the order of 40,000.  As these have not yet been fully processed, it is not <Col N="1661" /> possible to give figures for the numbers of animals applied on.</P>
    <P>Payment of the balances due under the disadvantaged areas' headage schemes has now commenced.  Payment of the balance of the special beef and suckler cow premia cannot be made to a particular applicant until all applications received from him-her in the course of 1993 have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. The processing of November 1993 applications means that in most cases payment of the final 40 per cent of premium will not start before late March.  This time-frame is in line with the situation in other member states and my understanding is that the 40 per cent balances are expected to be paid in most of them in the period April to June of this year.  The EU regulations provide for payment, other than in exceptional cases, of special beef and suckler cow premia not later than 30 June of the year following the year of application.</P>
    <P>Total applications under the various livestock schemes in 1993 reached 640,000.  The comparable figure in 1992 was about 370,000.  As everyone is aware many schemes are highly complex both from the point of view of farmers and of the administration.  I have recently announced a £4.8 million investment for 1994 to develop and upgrade computer facilities and other resources particularly in local offices, with the objective of achieving the optimum delivery of my Department's services to farmers and with special emphasis on the timely payment of headage and premia grants.</P>
    <P>Given the very substantial increase in the volume of applications in 1993 and the new integrated control system introduced under the EU regulations, I believe that the record level of payment achieved speaks for itself.  The additional resources which I have obtained from the Government will result in an even higher level of payment being achieved in 1994 and should enable the payment of all eligible premium claims within three <Col N="1662" /> months of application in 1995, where this is allowed under EU rules.</P>
    <P>The headage and premium schemes involve considerable amounts of money &mdash; as much as £600 million when the CAP reforms are fully in place in 1995.  It is understandable that the European Commission lays down very specific conditions for these schemes and this inevitably requires the filling of forms and the meeting of other requirements. My objective is to keep forms and administrative procedures as simple as possible and my Department is continuously monitoring all elements of the schemes with this in mind.  Help sheets are available with all scheme application forms and farmers were further assisted in 1993 by way of information seminars held throughout the country by my Department in conjunction with Teagasc.  My Department's staff and Teagasc will continue to give advice and help to farmers in completing applications.  Seminars are again commencing this week to tie in with the area aid application period.</P>
    <P>Farmers themselves can help in the speedier processing of their application forms by completing them carefully and fully.  The submission of incomplete application forms, the entry of incorrect herd or tag numbers, failure to submit cattle identity cards all lead to delay in processing applications and to delayed payment.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of January-February 1993 and June special beef premium cases awaiting advance payments are the subject of queries.  For example, up to 40,000 June 1993 applicants were written to by my Department, some as early as last August, and responses are coming through only slowly.  Reminder letters have issued in many cases, in some more than once; as many as 20,000 reminder letters are issuing this month alone.  I am anxious to facilitate timely payments but farmers who do not respond to genuine inquiries from my Department cannot expect their applications to be cleared. At the same time, I believe that more and more farmers are now treating the application procedures with greater care. Clearly the information seminars and <Col N="1663" /> help sheets are having the desired effect. A considerable improvement in the completion of forms is already discernible in the November 1993 applications.  I expect this to result in speedier payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been endeavouring to follow the Minister's reply but I have to say that it is wrong for him to take so many other questions which relate to different schemes, with the priority question. This does not make it particularly easy for the general public to be well informed.  Is the Minister concerned that of 152,968 applications for the January-February and June 1993 special beef premium some 67,000 or 40 per cent were the subject of queries?  Does he agree that this was not due simply to the failure of farmers to fill in the forms properly but rather to some fundamental flaw in the system?</P>

      <P>The situation is far from satisfactory and I have acknowledged this from the start.  These are new and complex schemes and, in consultation with the farming organisations, we have endeavoured to simplify the forms as much as possible.  We have also issued help sheets and held seminars and lectures all over the country to provide information and assist farmers in every way possible, but the fact remains that a large number of applications are submitted without identity cards and with incomplete forms.  We have written to farmers &mdash; in many cases a second time &mdash; asking them to supply the necessary information. I am not blaming farmers in any way for this because the amounts of money involved are very considerable. This also creates difficulties for staff in the departmental offices.  The processing of these applications has caused difficulty not only in Ireland but throughout the other member states.  A record amount of money, £377 million, was paid out last year and it will be improved this year but it will be next year before I will be able to give a guarantee that each eligible applicant will be paid within three months.  Given that these are new <Col N="1664" /> schemes under which there have been 650,000 applications and given the number of animals involved, this is reasonable, provided we receive the co-operation of all the applicants and the farm leaders encourage people to be more careful.  Teagasc did a tremendous amount of spade work.  Its officials worked late at night, endeavouring to assist applicants to get the money as quickly as possible.  That is what we are trying to do and I think we can meet our commitments in that regard.</P>

      <P>A sense of proportion is required.  To date, 82 cases of the disease have been confirmed in Ireland since the first case was confirmed in January 1989. This is an average of 16 cases per year and, in the context of a bovine herd of seven million, this is an extremely low incidence of disease.  There is informing the public and scaremongering.  The Department has acted responsibly and the policy of depopulation is invoked when an animal is diagnosed or where a suspicious or diagnosed carcase occurs. The carcase is disposed of by either burning or burial.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the disease is transmitted from animal to animal or from animal to human.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the farm prices proposals for the marketing year 1994-95, the EU Commission has proposed that member states should be allowed to choose 1989, 1990 or 1991, but not 1992, as the reference year for determining national quotas applicable to the special beef premium.  The Commission has made no proposal in relation to the quota arrangements for the suckler cow premium.</P>
      <P>When the Commission's proposals come to be considered by the Council of Ministers, my aim will be to ensure that the productive capacity of Irish agriculture is not reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers were under the impression that 1992 would be the base year for establishing quotas.  If the Minister allows the Commissioner to base the quota on the 1991 output it will drastically reduce farmers' incomes and affect their capability of gaining any decent quota base for beef production.  Will the Minister impress on Commissioner Steichen the necessity to treat 1992 as the base year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will strongly resist any attempt to reduce the quota to Ireland based on 1992 output.  The Commissioner explained that the reason for this proposal is that the special beef premium for beef cattle had increased by 30 per cent compared with previous years because producers were allowed to use 1992 as a reference year and calves born in the spring of 1992 were eligible when we allowed a second application in November. About eight other countries had massively increased quotas for that year. The Commissioner explained that this could only lead to a deterioration in the market balance in the not too distant future.  He emphasised that abolishing 1992 as a reference year would not lead to a reduction in the existing premium <Col N="1670" /> benefits but would reduce the incentive to increase production in the future.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Commission has not gone ahead with the proposal to make a change in the suckler cow premium base.  Will the Minister comment on the fear that the proposed deletion of 1992 as the base year could reduce the number of special beef premiums paid here by up to 400,000?  Will the Minister further agree that we are seeing an attempt by the Commission to row back on the compensations that were supposed to have been given for the CAP reform with which the Minister agreed and for the GATT which the Minister allowed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Steichen last month in relation to these matters.  On the question of suckler cow premiums, farmers have individual quotas and individual quota rights, so there is a legal question.  Some farmers are still concerned, but there is no proposal to tamper with that.  The present proposal envisages reducing our quota by 33 per cent, from 1.54 to 1.13 million, but on the basis of existing cow numbers, 2.2 million head, we will never reach 1.5 million.  On average, the number of male calves born annually and likely to reach eight months should not exceed 360,000 head.  We have an adequate quota and are unlikely to be penalised by the quota proposed.  Nevertheless, I will insist that the Commissioner sticks to the agreement based on 1992 output.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a proposal <Col N="1671" /> and nothing has been allowed to happen yet.  The Commissioner is looking at individual states and at the increase of 30 per cent on the base year.  He, naturally, came to the conclusion that member states took advantage of the base year and decided that quotas should be brought back nearer to what the average should be for the preceding three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

Surely that is not mindful of agricultural interests in the long term when we may be well able to fulfil the quota we are allowed under the 1992 figures.  It is essential that the Minister ensures the base year finally agreed is 1992.  He is damaging our case by almost conceding the point to Commissioner Steichen.</P>

    <P>The total number of applications received under the deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme in 1993 was 16,200.

    <P>The amount unpaid cannot be calculated until the farmers who have not yet been paid respond to inquiries made to them in order to determine eligibility.

      <P>As I stated, these are new and complex schemes involving a considerable amount of money.  All premium payments are paid by the European Union who lay down the regulations.  Since the commencement of the scheme we have refined the regulations in consultation with the Commission and will continue to do so. Animals which do not qualify for the special beef premium because of the application of the national quota or stocking density provision can qualify for the deseasonalisation premium.  In order to qualify for the deseasonalisation slaughter premium a farmer must have the animal slaughtered in an approved meat export premises and submit the BTE cards for the animal to the veterinary staff at the plant.</P>

What percentage of the applicants is represented in the £10 million payment?  How many of the applicants are awaiting payment?  This scheme was introduced on 1 January 1993 and ran until 30 April 1993.  Why did it take at least six months to issue payment to eligible farmers?

      <P>Does the Minister realise that while what he stated may be true as far as EC regulations are concerned, many farmers who qualified for the ten months premium and then qualified for the 22 months premium have been rejected for the slaughter premium? They have not yet been paid for a slaughter premium due to them last year.  Those farmers who did not bother to apply for the slaughter premium and kept their cattle until May received payment equivalent to the slaughter premium immediately.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 17, 30, 43, 50, 60, 66, 67, 70 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission has been in existence for more than 100 years and its powers and functions are enshrined in a vast body of law dating back to 1881.  In view of the complex nature of the issues involved in the winding up of such a body I do not accept that the delay in commencing the dissolution Act has been excessive.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I should like to remind Deputies that when the Oireachtas enacted the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992 it recognised that the proper winding up of the commission would require a degree of careful organisation which should not be pre-empted by an externally imposed date and it consequently provided me with the power to appoint a date for commencement of the Act.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that, in addition to abolishing the offices of lay and judicial commissioners, the dissolution Act provides for the transfer to me of the continuing powers and functions of the commission.  These include certain judicial powers and certain excepted functions which were previously reserved to the lay commissioners.  Arrangements for the exercise and performance of these powers and functions within my Department are at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to sign the commencement order in the near future.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recall there was a lengthy debate in relation to that proposal.  I had hoped that the remaining land owned by the land commissioners would have been disposed of and that is one of the reasons for the delay in signing the order.  Unfortunately, there are approximately 1,175 hectares of undivided land on the books of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  There are legal difficulties regarding the allocation of the remaining lands.  The signing of the commencement order should not be delayed further and I hope the Minister will be in a position to sign it in the near future.</P>

Those documents are inaccessible and this causes major delays and financial expense.

      <P>Arrangements have already been put in train for the commencement of this year's bovine TB eradication programme, involving a full test on every herd in the country together with any necessary consequential testing. EU funding for the disease eradication schemes has not yet become available. While agreement has been reached with the Commission on the technical conditions associated with the funding application, the financial resource currently available to the EU veterinary fund is not adequate to meet existing member state applications.  The Minister is continuing to press at EU Council level for an increase in the veterinary fund to enable the TB programme in this country to be supported, as well as having a greater level of resources to assist the attainment of the highest possible animal health status in the Single Market.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to increase the rates of the levies payable under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979. Levies were reduced in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is a little disingenuous to say that general agreement has not yet been reached on the extra funding when he knows that the Commission has said there is no extra funding available for this year?  Will the Minister say whether, contrary to the great gift he has given of not increasing levies, he has any proposals <Col N="1685" /> to reduce levies on farmers in view of the problems they face?  Has he any proposals to introduce a system of live valuation for reactor cattle?</P>

      <P>The Minister is continuing to make every effort to achieve an increase in the veterinary fund.  Extra funding becoming available from the veterinary fund may provide us with scope for substantial reductions.  There are no proposals to increase levies this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a sporting man and we have had discussions in the House on other sports.  Will he give an indication of the odds he would take on money being made available for the veterinary fund?  Will he agree that there is not the slightest prospect that more money will be made available for the veterinary fund this year?  What contingency plans has he to ensure that a full round of testing is carried out this year and that all requirements are met?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A full round of testing will be carried out.  In 1991 the number of reactors per 1,000 animals tested was 4.4.  This figure was reduced to 3.3 in 1992 and 2.9 last year.  This is a very encouraging trend and it remains to be seen whether it will continue.  In the context of the veterinary fund, projects in operation in other member states will be brought to a conclusion and I have every confidence that extra funding will become available, although I cannot give an exact date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the part of Deputy Dukes' question which the Minister did not answer regarding compensation to farmers who sustain severe losses and in many cases total loss of income, will the Minister give an assurance that in any negotiations with the EU on this matter &mdash; at present compensation is paid to farmers who have 100 livestock units or less &mdash; he will seek a substantial increase in the level of compensation, which has not been adjusted for a very <Col N="1686" /> long time and is out of line with the rate of inflation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be part of the package to be put together.  Obviously there are areas of research involved, for instance, vaccines for the treatment of badgers could become available.  If funds become available, an increase such as that referred to by the Deputy will be part of the package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, considering the problems in this area, the chance of getting EU funds in the near future is quite small?  Deputy Leonard rightly raised the point that some areas are experiencing serious problems with TB.  Accepting the figures given by the Minister, obviously more funds must be made available by way of compensation.  On the point raised by my colleague about the 100 livestock units, my area experiences a major problem in this regard.  Will the Minister increase the compensation for farmers whose herds are infected with TB and brucellosis, many of whom may be put out of business as a result?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 39, 58, 78, 132 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of the Leader 2 programme are a matter for decision by the European Commission.  I understand that a draft of the new programme will be available shortly from the Commission for discussion with member states, and consultation with the European Parliament. In these circumstances it is likely to be well into the second half of 1994 before the new round is in operation.</P>
      <P>For the reasons indicated, I am unable to say precisely what types of groups will be eligible for Leader 2.  The current programme allowed for the participation of public, private or mixed bodies and, in keeping with the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; principle of rural development in empowering local communities, I expect to see the same flexibility in Leader 2.</P>
      <P>For similar reasons, it is not possible at this stage to indicate that any particular area will be covered by the new programme. The Government's commitment to Leader is very clearly spelled out in the National Development Plan and the Government is satisfied that Leader can be applied effectively to all rural areas.  To achieve this, it is vital that sufficient numbers of well-organised groups with good business plans come forward to participate in the next round of Leader.  Given my responsibility for rural development, I expect that Leader 2 will operate, once again, under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>Apart from Leader, rural areas will benefit from other measures proposed in the National Development Plan.  For example, aid will continue to be available for a whole range of alternative farm enterprises involving non-surplus products including horticulture, sport horses, deer and rural tourism.  In addition, the designation of ten new rural areas for participation in the local development programme, as announced last week, is a further advance in the Government's strategy to combat unemployment in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that <Col N="1689" /> Offaly County Council's involvement in the Leader 1 programme was particularly successful and that the experience gained from that council's involvement in that programme could be applied successfully to a number of other local authorities? Will he further agree that the expertise and experience of the professional staff of Offaly County Council was an important factor in ensuring the success of the Leader 1 programme in County Offaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Leader programme has been an outstanding success in County Offaly and I compliment Offaly County Council on its administration of the programme.  Many other local authorities assisted community groups, etc., in the implementation of the Leader programme in their areas. There are no specific criteria in regard to the people who will be entitled to make applications, prepare business plans, etc. It will be open to statutory authorities, community organisations and individuals to submit business plans to the Department for consideration in the context of what I hope will be a national Leader programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Leader 2 programme is coming on stream, will the Minister agree that he has an obligation to sort out a problem which exists at county level where, due to a lack of co-ordination at Government level, there is duplication, confusion and overlapping by too many organisations and not enough co-ordination?  Will he agree that difficulties are arising because the Leader programme is being operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the county enterprise boards, county development teams, local authorities and national bodies are all dealing with similar areas and groups? This overlapping and duplication is having the opposite effect to that being sought by the Minister in regard to rural development.  Does the Minister regard the Leader 2 programme as an opportunity to sort out that problem and put in place at county level structures which will deal with these problems?  As the <Col N="1690" /> Minister recognises the problems which exist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a question about the time lag in the second half of the year.  The Minister referred to this issue before but it is now of critical importance.  How does the Minister intend to deal with existing Leader projects which will come to an end during the next few months and will run out of money?  How does the Minister propose to deal with that time lag, particularly in regard to the people employed under the schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus on all schemes, whether they come under the Leader Operational Programme for Rural Development or the county enterprise boards, is to deal with the major problem of unemployment.  The Government has taken a very positive stand in regard to national schemes, the county enterprise boards &mdash; the statutory structures at county level &mdash; and, most important, as was clearly demonstrated yesterday by the Taoiseach in his presentation, in giving communities the opportunity to become involved in what I like to describe as nation building through community development.  I do not think this should give rise to any conflict of interest. The Leader programme is very different to the measures being taken at national level or by the county enterprise boards. Under the Leader programme local communities come together in isolation from statutory structures to identify the community's potential for development and to prepare a business plan for submission to the Department for funding by the European Commission and national Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a tremendous response to that programme.  Yesterday we were able to demonstrate that within that pilot programme, which has been running for approximately 18 months, we will create approximately 2,000 full time jobs and approximately 5,000 part time jobs.  Due <Col N="1691" /> to the fact that the programme has a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach to rural development and is community-based and community orientated, I do not believe statutory agencies would be able to create these jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national and county agencies, the county enterprise boards, there is a need for voluntary community participation through programmes such as the Leader programme.  The Leader programme is being evaluated by an independent person who will clearly demonstrate the success of the programme. I am satisfied that we will be able to demonstrate to Europe &mdash; it is a European pilot programme &mdash; the success of the programme being administered in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Coming from an area which has benefited from the Leader programme, I agree with the Minister's positive assessment of it. In view of the likely demonstration of its advantages by areas which have benefited from the Leader 1 programme to areas which would like to benefit from the Leader 2 programme, is it necessary for the Government to strongly urge the European Commission to increase substantially the funding for the latter programme to give such areas a better chance to do so?  In the context of the review of the Leader 1 programme in preparation for the Leader 2 programme, will the Minister agree that two of the main issues which need to be addressed are matching funding, particularly in very deprived areas which might not be immediately able to provide the necessary resources, and building-up the capacity of local communities which perhaps do not have a tradition in training or education in terms of community development so that they can benefit from the Leader 2 programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Leader 2 programme and funding, I am very optimistic that the amount allocated to the next programme will be sufficient to <Col N="1692" /> enable us to have a national programme. Therefore, I hope that what has been a very successful pilot programme in 16 areas can be extended on a national basis. The amount of funding likely to become available will be made known in the draft programme which is being prepared and which, hopefully, will be circulated within the next few weeks.  I have noted Deputy Gallagher's point in regard to the importance of training.  This is an appropriate time for me to congratulate the Deputy on obtaining a masters degree in rural development.  Training is important in the context of our experiences in the delivery of the Leader 1 programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher asked about matching funding.  From our experience of Leader that has been a difficulty for some groups.  I hope we will be able to negotiate, in the context of Leader 2, a certain measure of flexibility on how best we can address the problems of communities who find it difficult to raise the 50 per cent local community funding.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus asked about the time lag between the current Leader 1 programme and the commencement of Leader 2.  Quite honestly, I am also concerned about that because I can identify with the difficulties.  We had many discussions with the European Commission in relation to trying to source funds to bridge the gap between Leader 1 and Leader 2.  I have to confess we have not been successful on the sourcing of that level of funding.  We will continue to discuss this matter within the Department and with the Leader network to see if there is any way we can be of assistance. The Deputy was correct in stating that we have in place within the 16 pilot schemes well qualified people and I would not want to see them lost to Leader 2.  I regret to say that I do not have a positive response to the Deputy's point in regard to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Eamon Ó Cuív Eamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Eamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it important that in future these programmes would be run over a long period?  While I accept the original programme was a pilot project, one of the negative features of most of these EU <Col N="1693" /> programmes to date, including the IRD and the Leader programme, is their short-term nature?  Would the Minister accept that community development is a long drawn out process and that if we want to achieve long-term results we must have long-term programmes?  Is it correct to infer from the Minister's statement that in the long-term he hopes to see all rural communities covered by some Leader programme?  There certainly has been a feeling of isolation among people in areas adjacent to those that are included in a programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the time factor and the lack of continuity is a disadvantage to the delivery of community development programmes. However, I remind the House that we are talking about what was initially a five year pilot scheme; it took almost two years to get the structures in place.  Effectively we were talking about little less than three years for the delivery of the programme.  Deputy Ó Cuív is correct in stating that there is a need for continuity in this regard and I hope that the Commission can now endorse the success of Leader not only in Ireland but at European level also, that there will also be an acceptance of the importance of the continuity of the programme and that between the ending of Leader 2 and the commencement of Leader 3 there will not be the time lag which Deputy McManus and others identified. However, we must acknowledge that we are dealing with a pilot programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to the essential point of Deputy Upton's question which was in regard to building a partnership between various agencies such as local authorities and county enterprise boards.  In County Roscommon I am certainly interested in building partnerships with, say, the county enterprise board because enterprise will develop from rural based enterprises and the economic fabric has been so weakened by neglect and so on that we must look to that area.  I accept the Minister's point that the Leader programme <Col N="1694" /> must be allowed to be as independent as possible but there is the problem of matching funds in areas where funding is difficult to raise &mdash; 50 per cent is rather low.  A county enterprise board may be interested in giving additional funding to a project&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your patience, Sir.  Let us assume that a county enterprise board was willing to give an additional 20 or 25 per cent, will the Minister agree that should be allowed to go ahead rather than falling foul of a Civil Service regulation which would have the effect of killing what would otherwise be a worthy project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very disappointed to discover that there was any conflict of interest between the community concept of Leader and the important work which will be undertaken by, for example, the county enterprise boards.  We are talking about people and communities within counties and I can see no reason there should not be sufficient dialogue between county enterprise boards and Leader management groups with regard to harmonising their respective programmes for community development.  There is a place for both and I am satisfied they can work in harmony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied also that we will achieve our objective in the context of trying to create the maximum number of jobs by way of the application of schemes which are being undertaken by the Government, and the regional and local authority schemes which will be delivered by the county enterprise boards.  There will then be the potential to develop, at local and community level, other opportunities for job creation.  The only way forward is for the Government, the statutory authorities and the communities to work together with a common goal to build this nation through community development.  There should be no conflict <Col N="1695" /> of interest and I would be extremely disappointed if that was the case because members of local authorities are also members of local communities.  I was a member of a local authority for 25 years and I know how close local public representatives are to their local communities. I would abhor the thought of any conflict of interest between communities working together and the statutory agencies.</P>

      <P>It is important that urgent funding is allocated to the new Leader programme because the momentum has built up and many of the projects have been dealt with.  The Minister should recommend Leader groups to have close liaison with the county enterprise boards.  I am a member of a county enterprise board and we sought a meeting with the Leader groups.  In future, the projects will be divided into two groups; those more suitable to Leader and those of a more industrial nature suitable to the enterprise boards.  There has never been a better opportunity to take up funding but, unfortunately, the local authorities do not have it.  If the local authorities had sufficient funding for community groups, much work would be done and real community rural development programmes would be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated earlier that in the context of our submission to the European Commission for Leader 2, we recommended a greater degree of flexibility in relation to the 50 per cent local contribution.  We also recommended, for example, that there should be a combination of direct grants and perhaps low interest loans to local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recommend also that there should be some kind of revolving fund under which successful groups would be in a position to repay some capital grants, which would maintain a continuity of funding to assist with the seed capital necessary for further development.  We have made positive proposals arising from our experiences with Leader 1.  I am not in a position to say to what extent <Col N="1696" /> the Commission is likely to take these recommendations on board.  Hopefully, we will have the discussion document available within a couple of weeks which will enable this House, communities generally and local authorities to become involved in a debate.  I should like to think that such a debate would not last too long because I am anxious to see Leader 2 come on stream fairly soon.  I hope that at the end of the day, our experiences will be incorporated in the new proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister of State that he is sure when Leader 2 will begin.  I am extremely worried by his commitment to have the provisions of the Leader 2 programme guaranteed nationwide.  Has the Minister made that remark before being sure what finance is available?  Will the moneys be spread over such a wide area it will mean nothing to the country as a whole?  Areas such as Cavan-Monaghan desperately needed the Leader programme.  If its provisions are to be spread nationally &mdash; perhaps even to the city of Dublin &mdash; at least we would need to be sure that we had sufficient moneys to supply the needs of those areas where success has been proven.  It would be wrong to have such funding removed from areas doing well under the Leader 1 programme merely to spread it more widely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a valid point.  The extent to which it can become a national programme will depend on the amount of funding made available by the European Union.  On the last occasion, there were 32 applications under the Irish Leader programme, 16 of which were selected by the European Commission for funding.  I indicated earlier that I would be hopeful, if not optimistic, that the level of funding to be made available under Leader 2 would be substantially greater than under Leader 1.  In that context I want to see the programme made available to communities nationwide. The discussion document will contain an indication of the amount of money to be made available globally to the Leader <Col N="1697" /> programme.  We will then be in a better position to assess to what extent we can extend its provisions nationally.  While acknowledging that the 16 pilot areas were all important and clearly demonstrated the potential of the programme, we cannot be selfish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister of State seems to be unaware of the problem of lack of co-ordination between bodies at local level.  Will he consider a report on County Wicklow published very recently which pinpointed one of the difficulties in relation to job creation as the lack of co-ordination between the different agencies?  While it appears that the Minister is viewing the programme to a certain extent through rose tinted glasses, will he avail of the opportunity to deal with the problems under Leader 2?  Rural enterprise very often means having to approach four or five different agencies making the same case to obtain funding whereas the idea of a one-stop-shop would make an enormous difference to rural communities or individuals endeavouring to develop enterprise in their areas?  Will he accept that co-ordination is a genuine problem and how does he consider it might be resolved before beginning Leader 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will give serious thought to how best we can co-ordinate all these programmes.  It has not been my experience that there is a conflict of interest between the 16 Leader groups and statutory agencies nationwide.  On the contrary, it has been my experience that there has been a very high level of co-operation and, in many cases, participation &mdash; Deputy Upton recognised its success in Offaly &mdash; statutory support <Col N="1698" /> and very often involvement with the voluntary community agencies, such as the various Leader groups.  However, as the Deputy made the point that there is a need perhaps for a greater degree of co-ordination I will examine that matter to ascertain to what extent that may be justified. One of the strengths of the Leader programme is the fact that it is community-based, that there is the minimum level of interference, if you like, on the part of the Department, myself or whoever. While not wanting to appear to be engaging in self praise, I think there would be an acknowledgement that the Leader programme has been administered with the minimum of bureaucracy by the Department.  Indeed the only occasions I had to visit Leader groups was in a complimentary fashion, to ascertain what they were doing and to encourage them but there has never been any undue interference by me or my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply implied that local authorities and county enterprise boards were in conflict with Leader, they are not; we are saying that the county enterprise boards and local authorities do not consider they have permission to co-operate with Leader; in other words, they are afraid that the Department of the Environment might tell a local authority it is acting <i>ultra vires</i> by further matching funds under a Leader programme that might otherwise lead to the creation of a number of jobs; that if this additional funding was not obtained from an agency such as a county enterprise board a project might fail.  All we are asking is that the Minister works with his channels in Government to encourage local authorities and county enterprise boards in every possible way so that they would never find themselves in conflict with the law, or <i>ultra vires</i> in their actions in co-operating with the provisions of the Leader programme throughout the various regions accredited to that programme nationwide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's submission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas <Col N="1700" /> was made to the European Commission in November 1993.  The Commission is currently engaged in a technical examination of the submission.  It is not possible to be precise as to when this examination will be concluded.  In discussions with the Commission, I have urged that the examination be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>If the Commission accepts the submission, a detailed proposal will be made to the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers where a final decision will be taken after consultation with the European Parliament. At that time details of the outcome will be made available.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that following a positive decision by the EU on the proposals for the extension and reclassification of disadvantaged areas, the Government is fully committed to its implementation.</P>

      <P>I am very annoyed at the Minister's reply since it is now over two years since he told a packed hall in his constituency in Dunmanway that the result of our application would be made available within 12 months.  Surely the Minister agrees that the processing of this application has been anything but successful as far as farmers are concerned, that it is cold comfort to the thousands of farmers in limbo because they do not know whether they are included in the extended disadvantaged areas scheme?  Will the Minister do his best to expedite a decision on this very important matter, one of life and death for some people awaiting inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are no simple solutions to the problems &mdash; many of a complex social nature &mdash; associated with moneylending and particularly with illegal moneylending. It has been a problem in society from biblical times and I cannot guarantee legislation to wipe it away overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> However, this Bill will introduce to law a body of reforms which go beyond the minimum requirements of the directives. It will repeal all existing consumer credit law and provide unified legislation.</P>
    <P>Essentially the consumer protection provided for in this Bill will encourage consumers to have more confidence in obtaining credit by providing a discipline whereby the achievement of a high level of consumer satisfaction will be of advantage to credit institutions and credit intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect in Irish law to two European Union Directives.  They are, Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 and the amending Directive 90/88/EEC of 22 February 1990 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning consumer credit.  The Directives require member states to provide a minimum level of consumer protection in the area of credit.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Bill will establish throughout the State what might be called the new approach to the regulation of credit.  In the past, Ireland adopted consumer credit legislation on a piece-meal basis, dealing mainly with instalment sales, hire-purchase and certain types of personal loans.  The result was to channel the supply of credit from regulated forms of transaction into unregulated forms.  This fragmented form of statutory regulation distorts competition between suppliers of credit and creates artificial distinctions between different types of transaction.  In recent decades the banks and finance houses devised new forms of lending.  Suppliers of credit for instalment sales witnessed an erosion of their market share, not through any relative inefficiency in their operations, but through the advantages enjoyed by those suppliers of credit able to avoid the piece-meal regulation of credit in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The new approach will close this loophole by ensuring that virtually all forms of consumer credit &mdash; including mortgage credit &mdash; will be regulated on a comprehensive basis.  It will also enable comparisons to be made between competing <Col N="1811" /> sources of credit by requiring disclosure of the Annual Percentage Rate of charge.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the Bill strikes the right balance and addresses adequately the deficiencies and gaps in the present legislation, I have engaged in extensive consultations, as have the officials in my Department with the Consumers Association of Ireland, other consumer interests, the banks, building societies, finance houses, insurance industry, insurance brokers, moneylenders, IBEC, Incorporated Law Society, Irish Centre for European Law, ICTU and, most importantly, those representing the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society, i.e. the Combat Poverty Agency, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, money advice and budgeting service officers under the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Press, radio and television are being resorted to increasingly as a powerful instrument of product sales and promotion. On television and radio and across the pages of our local and national newspapers are advertisements offering what seem like unbeatable credit bargains. But what is missing very often from these heavily sold offers are adequate and clear details of many of the important loan conditions to enable the consumer to make an informed and rational decision.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the selling message must be accompanied by information on the cost of the credit and a statement of any restrictions on the availability of such credit.  There will also be a legal obligation that, where goods are offered on credit, the cash price, the total credit price and the number and amount of instalments must be clearly shown.</P>
    <P>Equally the Bill lays down detailed requirements on the form and content of credit agreements.  It is true to say that generally consumers are not being afforded sufficient time or opportunity to study and, if necessary, take independent professional advice on agreements governing the granting of credit to them. Apart from mortgage documents, the invariable practice has been to produce the loan agreement and have the consumer <Col N="1812" /> sign it on the spot.  Many of these agreements are weighed down by language which is scarcely intelligible to the legal and financial profession &mdash; which leaves little hope to the consumer of understanding their terms and implications.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for greater transparency and intelligibility, the Bill stipulates a cooling off period of ten days for all credit agreements, except mortgages. It is clear that if you were to distort the market with regard to a cooling off period for mortgages you would distort purchasing and selling arrangements and leave many people in a serious situation.</P>
    <P>It is up to consumers to make use of this important breathing space to ensure, if they want to, that they are fully acquainted with the extent and nature of their obligations.</P>
    <P>Sometimes problems only manifest themselves when the consumer has already entered into a credit agreement. The goods or services purchased and financed by credit may be found to be defective, unsatisfactory or not in conformity with the supply contract.  The Bill provides &mdash; as it did in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 &mdash; that where there are pre-existing arrangements between the supplier of the goods or services and the creditor, both parties shall be jointly and severally liable in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is also not uncommon for creditors to pursue consumers who may have fallen into arrears by phoning or otherwise contacting consumers at their place of employment.  Many of these contacts are not exercised with due discretion or regard for the privacy of the consumer. This legislation will forbid such practice.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to introduce legislative provisions regulating most forms of consumer spending by: introducing new and stronger provisions in the area of moneylending; regulating matters arising during and at the end of credit agreements, for example, early repayment or prohibiting increased charges in the event of default; setting down parameters for the content of credit <Col N="1813" /> advertisements and credit agreements; and strengthening the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to allow for easier access by consumers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That is taken directly from the Programme for a Partnership Government. The commitment was made earlier with the Central Review Committee, again in the Programme for Government with the Progressive Democrats and also when Fianna Fáil were in Government on their own.  It was repeated in 1989-90 and also when I became Minister of State at the then Department of Industry and Commerce, following certain events in 1992. The then Leader of the Progressive Democrats said to me: &ldquo;This is a Bill you can get your teeth into, it is an important piece of legislation and I would like if you would look after it&rdquo;.  At that vulnerable time I was glad to get hold of it.  I have been involved with it since.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Bill will deliver on that commitment and, in addition, contain features related to mortgage credit.  The EC Directives were in connection with transparency and related to various matters but did not include matters relating to mortgages.  In my pursuit of the Bill I was conscious of the fact that the biggest, in a domestic consumer sense, purchase a consumer is ever likely to make is his or her home.  I did not see why the transparency and various other forms of financing should not apply also.</P>
    <P>The main effect will be that when a consumer takes out a loan or otherwise avails or credit, he or she will be given the maximum amount of information to ensure full awareness of the commitment being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Irish law on moneylending passed its &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date aeons ago.  The Moneylenders Act, 1933 &mdash; which had built on the none too solid foundations laid by the Moneylenders Act, 1900 &mdash; was designed primarily to control the rapacious activities of loan sharks, although finance houses without banking licences or the benefit of a ministerial exemption were also caught by its provisions.  The Irish legislation in this area bears a close resemblance to the legal regime which <Col N="1814" /> obtained in the United Kingdom before the enactment in that jurisdiction of the Consumer Credit Act, 1974.  That Act was subsequently updated.  In the early 1970s the authors of the Crowther report on Consumer Credit identified the weaknesses in the UK system.  Some of their criticisms are worth reproducing here because they highlight the special difficulties faced by legislatures in regulating moneylending.  The report of the Committee on Consumer Credit (Cmnd 4595, London, 1971) volume 1. paragraph 6.6.4. states:</P>
    <P>Most people borrowing from a moneylender are in a low income group and cannot readily obtain credit elsewhere.  They frequently lack the ability to budget and ... they are not motivated by the rational considerations which might usually be expected to influence the selection of purchases.  Moreover, such persons are likely to be ignorant of their legal rights and when proceedings are taken will usually allow those to go by default.</P>
    <P>The new Bill will go a long way towards remedying the social ills inherent in moneylending.  When I talk about moneylending I want to differentiate clearly between legal moneylenders &mdash; collected credit as their activity is sometimes referred to &mdash; and illegal moneylenders. I hope the effect of this Bill, as it is debated, talked through, disseminated and put into practice, will be that people will be strongly aware that there is coherence and shape to the collected credit movement.  I am referring here to legal moneylenders.  There is incoherence, chaos and all sorts of evils associated with illegal moneylenders.  Sometimes people rant on about moneylenders without specifying that there are legal and illegal moneylenders.  This Bill will include strong licensing and enforcement arrangements with regard to legal moneylenders and strong prohibitions against illegal moneylenders.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with other outdated legislation, the Hire-Purchase Acts, 1946-80. Although hire-purchase transactions are subject to quite stringent legal controls, <Col N="1815" /> finance companies, in liaison with dealers, have devised new methods of providing goods and services on credit to consumers.  This enables them to fall outside the catchment area of the Hire Purchase Acts, 1946-1980.  For example, personal loans not linked formally to the purchase of specific goods or services &mdash; but required by consumers for those purposes &mdash; increased markedly after the enactment of the hire-purchase legislation. The Consumer Credit Bill will remedy this mischief by adopting a broad spectrum, or all embracing approach to the regulation of consumer credit.  This will ensure truth in lending.  When I was researching this somebody from the co-operative movement wrote and drew to my attention an American Bill passed perhaps 20 years ago, called the Truth in Lending Act which is very much along the lines of what we are doing here.  It was very interesting to read it.  This Bill will ensure truth in lending and preclude many of the objectionable trade practices to which consumers have been subjected in the context of credit transactions.</P>
    <P>The purpose and thrust of the moneylending provisions in this Bill is fourfold; to implement the directives; to review and update the Moneylenders Acts; to deliver on the Government's commitment in the 1988, 1989 and other programmes and to address in an innovative and effective manner the scourge of unlicensed moneylending.</P>
    <P>When talking about the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs I will use the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; all the time.  Lest I be pounced upon for being sexist, I use that word because the present director is male.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is empowered to grant a moneylender's licence on the terms and conditions he sees fit to engage in the business of moneylending in a District Court area or areas as authorised.</P>
    <P>Applicants for moneylenders' licences must pay a fee of £1,000 for a licence to trade in one District Court district and a further fee of £500 for each additional district in which they intend to operate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> If the Director refuses to grant a licence or decides to vary, suspend or revoke a licence, he must inform the applicant or the holder of the licence, as the case may be, of his decision and there is a right to appeal.</P>
    <P>The court may on hearing the appeal, confirm the refusal or decision or may allow the appeal, whereupon the Director shall grant the licence or, as the case may be, will not revoke or vary the terms and conditions of the licence.</P>
    <P>This part of the Bill also contains provisions to deal with a number of practices which, it is alleged, are currently used by moneylenders and which result in the borrower not receiving the full amount of the loan, although on paper it would appear that this is the case.</P>
    <P>A moneylender may not advance a loan while retaining a portion of it in respect of repayment instalments or charges and base the charges for the loan on the full amount advanced.  Equally, the practice of retaining from a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; loan an amount in respect of an earlier loan while still basing the charge on the full loan being advanced is prohibited.</P>
    <P>A moneylender is obliged to keep a record of all transactions in a &ldquo;repayment book&rdquo;.  Many legal moneylenders are already operating properly and the purpose of this provision is to ensure that others do so.  This ensures that the consumer has at all times an up-to-date record of the position with regard to repayments under the moneylending agreement.  It will also provide authorised officers of the Director with a simple and straightforward way of checking that matters are in order.</P>
    <P>The repayment book must contain the name and address of both parties to the agreement, the amount of credit advanced, the date on which it was advanced, the number and amount of each repayment instalment, the rate of interest charged, the total amount payable in respect of the loan, the date of expiry of the loan and the agreement number or other reference which identifies the loan.  The manner or form in which repayments are to be recorded is also set out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> This section of the Bill also covers the collection of repayments at certain times. It will not be possible for such calls to be made between 9 p.m. and 10 a.m. on Sundays or public holidays.</P>
    <P>The impact of the legislation is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a specific role for the Garda Síochána in helping to stamp out illegal moneylending.  Under the Bill the Garda Síochána are empowered to request persons engaged in collecting credit to provide a moneylenders' licence or authorisation; to arrest, without warrant, persons engaged in unlicensed moneylending and to seize any document belonging to another person being held by those engaged in moneylending.</P>
    <P>This latter power is designed to eliminate the practice by unlicensed moneylenders of holding and encashing social welfare payment books belonging to their clients.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs will have responsibility for the functioning and enforcement of the legislation.  As outlined he will be responsible for the licensing of moneylenders.  In addition the Director will be responsible for the authorisation of mortgage intermediaries and credit intermediaries.  He will oversee the advertising and operation of credit agreements generally and pursue those whom he believes have committed offences.</P>
    <P>The Director will have extended powers and increased resources which will enhance his scope in the regulation of the credit industry.  He will investigate the workings of the credit system and monitor the practice of the financial institutions; go to the court for orders to stop breaches of the Consumer Credit Act on behalf of borrowers and consumers; give information and advice; apply to court to have excessive rates of interest charged by moneylenders and creditors, other than banks and building societies, declared illegal and unenforceable; licence moneylenders; authorise persons to act as credit or mortgage intermediaries; investigate credit information given about borrowers; direct financial <Col N="1818" /> institutions or lenders to withdraw advertisements or modify them.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Consummer Affairs will be provided with additional staff and, in furtherance of the commitment for regionalisation in the Programme for Government will, on a phased basis, have branch offices located in Cork, Limerick, Athlone and Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is in Dublin.  A primary aim of this regionalisation is to give consumers easier access to advice and redress.</P>
      <P>Member states are allowed to retain or adopt more stringent measures for the protection of the consumer and this has been done in relation to the upper and lower limits of 20,000 ECU and 200 ECU respectively envisaged by the Directive. Expanding the scope of the Bill beyond those limits has enabled the inclusion in the Bill of measures to deal with housing loans.</P>
      <P>Housing loans are the single most important financial outlay for most consumers. In this area also, the protection of the consumer needs to be strengthened.</P>
      <P>The legislation will provide for early repayment of a variable housing loan without the liability for a redemption fee; a formula indicating the total cost of credit; freedom of choice for the consumer in taking out house insurance; a prohibition on the lender from passing on to the consumer the cost of legal investigation of title to the house; the outlawing of the linking of services to the grant of a loan; a predetermined and clearly laid out format for housing loan agreements and the disclosure of all fees, charges and commissions in connection with a loan and any associated insurance policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date only some of these requirements have applied to housing loan transactions. Indeed such requirements as did apply only covered building society loans.  The Bill ensures that uniform and <Col N="1819" /> far reaching rules and procedures must be observed by all house mortgage lenders. This again is a significant advance on the present position.  By requiring greater openness and transparency, the consumers will be much better placed to assess and determine the best form of mortgage suitable to their needs and circumstances.</P>
    <P>The level of statutory regulation of the selling activities of financial intermediaries in the area of mortgages is extremely light and in most cases non-existent. The Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, 1987, regulates the display of APR but does not adequately cover many aspects.</P>
    <P>Most consumers prefer certainty to uncertainty and for a mortgage simply to enable them to buy their own homes. Endowment mortgages are complex financial products.  In deciding to take one, a consumer has to decide on credit, insurance and investment criteria, usually at the same time as making important decisions on property and home ownership. It can be difficult to make such decisions.  It is for this reason that the emphasis throughout the Bill is for transparency and fully understandable information. Expert advice is needed and this is usually provided by a mortgage or insurance broker.  I would not wish to reflect unfavourably on the manner in which such advice is given.  However, the position has been put to me by many that the high level of commissions paid in respect of such policies has led to a situation in which many of them are sold rather than bought.</P>
    <P>The directives are without question the most significant measures to emerge so far in the European Union in the area of consumer protection and rights.  Equally, the changes in our national law, resulting from this Bill, will have important implications for the legal process in the area of consumer credit.  Thus the position of Irish consumers will be advanced in a very significant way by providing additional legal redress to those already available under existing tort and contract law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> While this measure is aimed primarily at improving the position of the consumer &mdash; this it does in a considerable way &mdash; I emphasise that it is not intended as being loaded in any way against lenders or financial establishments.</P>
    <P>Clearly one approaches the Bill from the point of view of the consumer.  In the preparatory stages, we took soundings from everybody.  Of course, we did not agree with everything that was said and we did not have full agreement for our views.  However, we engaged in a wide-ranging consultative process.  I have written to those involved in that process offering them the services of my office and to meet with them during the debate on the Bill with a view to accepting reasonable points provided they are in accord with the main thrust of the Bill which is one of openness, transparency, full disclosure of information and empowerment of consumers.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by outlining the main benefits of the legislation.  First, it will introduce a high degree of transparency into the consumer credit field, thereby enabling consumers to choose the credit packages which provide them with optimum value.</P>
    <P>Second, it will afford the consumers of credit important contractual rights designed to safeguard them against commercial exploitation.</P>
    <P>Third, it will protect particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers by subjecting moneylenders to a very strict licensing regime.</P>
    <P>Fourth, it will open up the financial services marketplace by introducing provisions which will ensure a more competitive environment in the consumer credit area.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the licensing system that will be introduced following the passing of the Bill is fully operational, the fees generated by that system will be used to fund the implementation of enforcement of the new legislation.  This is vitally important in an era in which public spending is under increasing scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these wide-ranging and long overdue changes will benefit the consumer significantly and bring about <Col N="1821" /> a more balanced and fairer relationship between lender and borrower.</P>
    <P>Generally I prefer to speak without a set script and those who know me are aware of that.  However, this is a complex Bill and I want to set out clearly the philosophy behind it and the rationale for it.  This Bill is about material needs and consumers' rights but I see the issue of consumers' rights as having a deeper philosophy and base than it can encompass.  People should have confidence in conducting their business.</P>
    <P>We as a people do not complain enough &mdash; it is not that we want to be moaning minnies &mdash; and stand up for our rights.  We do not seek information or engage in counter debate on the merits of a product.  Indeed, we do not ask, why not?  often enough.  Why should purchasing credit be different from any other purchase?  To some people, finance is a mystery which they cannot understand and which is deemed impossible for them to understand.</P>
    <P>If people set out to purchase a product, they will ask about its durability, its make-up and whether it will serve a certain purpose.  However, when we are availing of services we do not put across our viewpoint clearly.  How often have people not taken the opportunity to complain or to challenge the provider of the product simply because it is not in our nature to do so?  I accept this Bill will not achieve this change overnight but there is a great need to empower consumers in a democratic way.  Consumers need to know and be fully informed of their rights and need to be free to ask about different products.</P>
    <P>This Bill &mdash; lest there be any misinformation on any aspect of it &mdash; sets out to ensure transparency and that transparency requirement applies to all credit purchases, from finance houses, building societies, mortgage intermediaries, moneylenders and so on.  The transparency arrangements apply to every institution.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the contributions on Second Stage.  The Committee Stage debate should be very interesting and challenging.  Those who <Col N="1822" /> were involved with me in processing legislation in recent weeks will know that I am prepared to consider all amendments.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing forward ministerial amendments, in particular one on bank charges in which I will suggest that the Director of Consumer Affairs should have the right of consultation with the Central Bank on the question of bank charges. The Bill because of its size and complexity is not held to be the optimum on every provision.  We do not pretend to have the optimum knowledge on every matter relating to the issue in the Department. I look forward to the cut and thrust of debate in the Chamber.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to prepare detailed comments on a Bill of this complexity but in broad terms I welcome it given that it has been in the pipeline for 15 or 16 years.  Since legislation was passed in the United Kingdom in 1974 we have been continually chiding ourselves about the inadequacy of our consumer legislation.  For five brief months in 1986 I had responsibility in this area when I attempted to do some of the things that are being done today, particularly to update the legislation relating to moneylending. I was disappointed that officialdom was sluggish in tackling this issue despite the fact that it was of importance to the community.  While I am delighted the legislation is being updated I am genuinely frustrated that it has taken so long, I think other observers feel the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of moneylending, I am not 100 per cent satisfied with the provisions. It was never a criminal offence under the Moneylenders' Act to lend at exorbitant rates although that Act provided that if one lent at rates in excess of <Col N="1823" /> 39 per cent it would be an unenforceable loan.  That was a hopeless provision in the protection of consumers.  No effort is being made to make it a criminal offence to lend at excessive rates.  We are still depending on the Director of Consumer Affairs to pursue cases where he believes money was lent at an excessive rate and take them to the courts.  However, a consumer will have no right of redress to the courts, which is surprising.</P>
    <P>The big problem is that many people who deal with moneylenders are unlikely to make it known to the Director of Consumer Affairs that they are experiencing problems.  Therefore, their cases are unlikely to find their way to his desk and then to the High Court to challenge those who lend at excessive rates.  The Minister should set up a forum to which the people would have access to make complaints and which would ensure fair play for those who have to deal with moneylenders. We will have to establish such a forum to deal with this problem successfully.</P>
    <P>In that context the community welfare officer is the obvious preson to deal with such complaints.  Up to last year the community welfare officer provided support to those facing difficulties in regard to lending.  Without making a political point it was a very foolish decision by the Government to change the provisions under which community welfare officers could help those experiencing problems with ESB and other regular bills and running into debt.  Many community welfare officers had successfully developed a system of home budgeting with clients who came to see them on a regular basis by saying, first, that they could only help a person once a year and then requiring them to prove that something exceptional has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy talking about social welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Under the rules this could not include what one would regard as normal payments such as First Communion and back-to-school <Col N="1824" /> expenses.  I am disturbed by this change as it removed an important prop for those in difficulty with moneylenders.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on the mainstream financial institutions to provide alternative sources to which persons who do not fit their normal description of a person with a good credit rating would have access.  The banks will always like to see that a person held a deposit or current account with them during the years.  In this way they have effectively ruled out most of the people about whom we are talking and prevented them from gaining access to the mainstream banking and financial institutions.  There is an onus on those large institutions to provide such a service to the community. When I had responsibility in this area I made an attempt to get the financial institutions to recognise this and provide some system to which people would have access to ensure they would not be forced into the hands of those likely to charge excessive rates of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the provisions relating to moneylending, as I already mentioned, I am disturbed at the procedure for enforcement given that it will not be open to the consumer to take such action and that he will have to go to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It seems that it will only be a criminal offence to engage in moneylending activity without a moneylender's licence.  While a licence may be revoked if people do not play by the rules we should take the question of abuses under consumer credit arrangements by licensed persons more seriously instead of challenging them when a licence comes up for renewal at some future date.  If we are to build up the confidence of consumers to complain about breaches we will have to do something to ease their problems; in other words, if consumers are being exploited they should be entitled to relief.  Last week we dealt with the issue of compensation for people who do not receive payment in accordance with their terms of employment.  In this instance if it is established there has been abuse under the terms of the Moneylenders Act a person should be entitled to relief and compensation.  This is not a <Col N="1825" /> feature of the Bill and we will have to build it into it if we are to build up the confidence of those who have to deal with moneylenders to assert their rights.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, I am concerned about the decision to exclude the banks and mortgage lenders from section 46 under which the Director of Consumer Affairs will have the power to challenge those who lend at excessive charges and interest rates.  Under section 48 he will have the power to change the terms of credit agreements he views as unfair.  I cannot understand why the banks and mortgage lending agencies should not have to succumb to the same disciplines as everyone else.  The Minister said she is creating a new atmosphere for consumers in relation to credit but I cannot understand why we should exclude the banks and mortgage lending agencies given that they are the mainstream lending agencies with whom consumers deal in the main. We should have a provision under which consumers can challenge the terms of such agreements.  For far too long one sided non-negotiable diktats have been handed down by the lending agencies and if we want to change this we must include the banks and all lending agencies under the terms of the Bill.  That is not an anti-banks or an anti-lenders agencies statement. It is a question of ensuring fair play and that agreements are two sided.  This legislation is supposed to be the vehicle through which we can ensure this.  The Minister should reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>The most valuable features of this Bill are that clear information and contracts must be presented to consumers.  There must also be a cooling off period.  These are welcome provisions but the Minister is selling her legislation short by not making all lending agencies amenable to these provisions.</P>
    <P>In the past less information was available about consumer lending, insurance and financial dealings generally than about the contents of a tin of beans on the side of which one can read the most copious detail about what has gone into the can, while, at the same time, decisions involving hundreds of thousands of pounds are not subject to the <Col N="1826" /> same obligations.  The changes in regard to information are welcome.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister has decided to exclude local authorities from the section dealing with mortgages. What is good for the goose should be good for the gander.  If consumers are to have rights in relation to lending agencies they should also be exercisable in relation to local authorities.  I admit that local authorities are generally sensitive to the needs of the people with whom they are dealing but that does not give them the right to be exempted.  We have learned in the context of the Planning Acts that although exemptions can be defended on the basis that public agencies will act in the best interest of the public, if they are exempted people will rightly feel they have not had fair play.  The exemption of local authorities and credit unions from the provisions is a mistake.  Both would be well able to stand four square beside any lending agency and beat them in terms of the way they deal with consumers, but that does not justify an exemption.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to a contentious issue, that is, bank charges.  As she did in regard to the Apprenticeship Bill, the Minister is promising an amendment at some future date that will deal with this.  However, it is not good enough to introduce a Bill that has taken 14 years to prepare and not include the one element she has made a public issue and for which she gained a great deal of support from the public, and expect us to wait and see what she might produce at a later stage.  The Minister has allowed to go unchallenged newspaper reports in which she said this Bill would control bank charges.  There is considerable public frustration with the welter of bank charges being levied on customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a major and progressive piece of legislation.  It is innovative and far reaching in its provisions, comprehensive in the areas it seeks to address and utterly praiseworthy in intent.  As it stands, however, it is not perfect nor without its share of shortcomings. Accordingly, my party will be seeking to make changes by way of amendment on Committee Stage. Having said that, the Progressive Democrats support and warmly welcome the main thrust of the Bill and commend the Minister on the work she has done in putting together this complex legislation which entailed much work.</P>
      <P>Society has come a long way since the time Christians were prevented from practising usury and the ultimate villain, Shylock, was parodied for seeking to extract his pound of flesh.  Credit has become the lifeblood of a modern economy. Millions of transactions, big and small, are made possible every day because of access to credit.  Items ranging from the simple and everyday, like paying for a meal in a restaurant or a hairdo to purchasing a family home or starting up a business, are conducted mainly on the basis of access to credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For reasons ranging from the security risk to sheer sophistication, citizens are moving towards an almost cashless lifestyle. This has brought about a huge sea change in banking and in the provision <Col N="1828" /> of credit.  Intense competition between lending institutions for clients has generated a minefield of confusion for even the most street wise consumers.  At the same time families on low incomes are ruthlessly exploited by illegal moneylenders. It is high time we regularised the whole business in laws that will strike a just and fair balance between the rights and responsibilities of the consumer on the one hand and of the lending institutions on the other.</P>
    <P>At the heart of this Bill is the right of consumers to basic information that will enable them to understand from the outset the full extent of their liabilities and to make informed judgments about what competing lending institutions have to offer so that they, the consumers, can evaluate fully whether they are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>An old Irish proverb says knowledge is power.  That being so, the information in this Bill will be hugely beneficial to consumers.  A majority of the population feel utterly powerless in the face of the complexities of the modern financial service world and it is high time we remedied this deficit.  I have said many times before that it is not unusual to meet somebody who can quote a passage from Shakespeare or deal with the more detailed grammar in Latin or Greek but who is powerless in the face of banks, negotiating a loan or filling in an income tax form.  That tells us something about the need to bring knowledge up to date.  That is what the Minister meant when she spoke of information that leads to consumer power.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to exaggerate the havoc caused to families by the activities of illegal moneylenders.  It is inevitable that families on very low incomes will be forced to borrow at certain times &mdash; for example, for first Communions, Confirmations, funerals or weddings.  The habit of saving seems to have died and since the weekly income is so small that it is not possible for families to save for these occasions, it is inevitable that families will go to moneylenders for credit. However, it is up to us to ensure in so far as possible that they do not go to illegal <Col N="1829" /> moneylenders, but to those who operate within the law as it stands and as it will stand when this legislation becomes law.</P>
    <P>In relation to the misery inflicted on families because of the activities of illegal moneylenders, if it were not for the exceptional good work done by credit unions and the sensitive approach of members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that misery would be more widespread. I hope this legislation will provide maximum protection for those families and that the activities of illegal moneylenders will be stamped out.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, the penalty for engaging in unlicensed moneylending will be a fine of £50,000 or a term of imprisonment of five years, but that should be reviewed every two or three years to ensure the fine keeps pace with money values and to establish if the penalty is having the desired effect and acts as a deterrent to the ghoulish practice of fleecing vulnerable and unsuspecting families.  At the end of the day, illegal moneylenders are the real scourge and one of the failures of this legislation is that it does not make a clear distinction between the activities and the rights of legal moneylenders, and those of illegal moneylenders.  The legislation is blurred in that regard.  That matter should be tightened up on Committee Stage because it is fundamental that a clear distinction is made.</P>
    <P>I will refer later to the powers envisaged for the Director of Consumer Affairs, a cornerstone of this legislation and a very wise move by the Minister. However, the director will not be in a position to investigate unlicensed moneylenders. Under the legislation powers are given to the Garda to prosecute offenders, but with respect to them, there has been a pitifully small number of prosecutions to date despite the fact that it is well known that the ratio in respect of legal and illegal moneylenders is 3 to 1. We should bear that in mind as we seek to frame the powers that will be effective in dealing with illegal moneylenders.</P>
    <P>We, in the Progressive Democrats, will propose specific measures on Committee Stage, including placing an obligation on <Col N="1830" /> chief superintendents to make a public annual report on the prevalence of unlicensed moneylending in their areas and to provide an account of the measures taken to curb the activities of illegal moneylenders.  Furthermore, we will propose that the Garda have a positive duty to receive and investigate reports of unlicensed moneylending from voluntary agencies and other sources.  We will table amendments to make detection, prosecution and conviction of unlicensed moneylenders easier and more efficient.</P>
    <P>As the legislation stands very few legislative aids are provided for the Garda to deal with unlicensed moneylending. Stiffer penalties are not enough.  Nearly all the changes in this Bill relate to licensed moneylending and these lenders will be subject to the supervision of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  A clear distinction must be made between the functions which lie within consumer law and the activities which belong in the area of criminality.  At present the Garda do not have adequate powers to deal with this matter and if the aspirations of this legislation to deal with illegal moneylending are to be effective, increased powers will have to be given to them.</P>
    <P>Unlicensed moneylenders are the real scourge.  They can act outside the law in respect of lending, the rates of interest charged and the recovery of loans and they frequently operate by means of threats and violence.  We need powers of arrest and search, statutory presumptions and to create a new offence which can curtail unlicensed moneylending.  We cannot rely on existing legal prohibitions.</P>
    <P>In regard to licensed moneylending, we must face up to the fact that a certain section of the community does not have access traditionally, culturally or economically to credit via the banks, building societies or credit unions.  Yet those people need credit, and one way or another they will get it.  Our duty is to make the provision of credit services to them transparent and to bring those services under the correct supervisory authority. They are a higher credit risk than &ldquo;bankable&rdquo; people or members of credit <Col N="1831" /> unions.  They often need to have collected credit agreements to bring them within the credit net.  I have spoken to members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Combat Poverty Agency and a number of other voluntary agencies in that regard who have acknowledged that fact.  Collected credit is a fact of life; it is more expensive than credit from banks or credit unions.  Of necessity and by its very nature it will incur a far higher APR than many other forms of credit.</P>
    <P>If a licensed moneylender lends, say, £100 and collects it over a six month period, it may involve 26 or 30 visits to the borrower's home.  If the total collected over six months is based on a cost of, say, £1 per visit a charge of £26 applies before interest.  If interest is charged on top of that, the total re-collected could amount to £136 or £140.  Because the £100 is recovered week by week, the average amount outstanding during the six months will be £50 and with charges of £36 the APR will appear to be enormous. Nevertheless, which of us would advance, say, £100 to a person with a very poor credit reference, employ a person to visit the borrower's home for £1 per week and be happy with a credit risk which might mean we might get no more than £10 or £15 in return?  Would any of us go into competition with unlicensed moneylenders to do that?  Would any of us go into the business of licensed moneylending at all?</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of this Bill is that it will oblige licensed moneylenders to state clearly their APR.  When the legislation is enacted borrowers will be able to see the real cost to them of borrowing from one licensed moneylender as opposed to another or from a licensed moneylender as opposed to a credit union.  That is an important development. That facility has not been available to date.</P>
    <P>We can posture in public and decry all moneylenders, that has been a feature of society in recent times, but we cannot honestly condemn if we will not acknowledge that moneylending will continue in one form or another and that the existing <Col N="1832" /> credit institutions will not facilitate less fortunate people who borrow from licensed moneylenders.  The best we can do is to control licensed moneylending, insist on high standards of fairness and transparency and prevent abuse or exploitation.  We must not drive out moneylenders because that would leave the field wide open to unlicensed competition and that would contradict what is intended in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to a number of matters in the Bill in regard to which my party and I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  Section 91 deals with the prohibition of collecting repayments at certain times.  The provisions in that section are not practical or feasible.  The ratio of unlicensed moneylenders to licensed moneylenders is 3 to 1.  We cannot afford the sad spectacle of licensed moneylenders waiting until 10 o'clock in the morning to offer their services while unlicensed moneylenders, in regard to whom no time restriction applies, can knock on doors before that time.  That provision must be considered. It is right to seek to control the calling time in a certain way but that is already catered for under section 44 which relates to the visits and telephone calls by creditors. Section 44 states, &ldquo;A creditor or a person acting on his behalf shall not visit or telephone &mdash; (a) a consumer without his consent&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

I will consider <Col N="1833" /> that section and will frame a practical amendment to it on Committee Stage.</P>

I am aware of the type of service which such persons give their consumers.  I considered tabling an amendment to the section, but I will propose deleting it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>We are slightly more distracted this afternoon than we would normally be.  A key cornerstone of this Bill is the increased powers to be given to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  His office is to be responsible for the operation and enforcement of the new law.  That is a wise move.  The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs should be responsible for consumer protection law.  My party and I fully support that provision.  It is important that the director be given sufficient additional personnel to enable him to ensure that all the elements of the provisions of the new legislation will be fully enforced.  We should allocate additional powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs as we did at one time to the Ombudsman when we did not provide additional necessary resources.  We must make proper provision in respect of additional personnel and sufficient resources to ensure that all provisions of this Bill are fully policed and enforced. It is important that such resources are provided at the outset, otherwise we will have a good law on the Statute Book which is not effective on the ground.  I know the Minister would not intend any law she introduces to be ineffective.  It is important that the Office of the Director of <Col N="1834" /> Consumer Affairs be decentralised.  An office in Dublin is not satisfactory to my constituents in Cork who have a grievance against a lending agency or institution.</P>

Decentralisation and the increased Garda powers which I will seek under another heading are important and those measures will ensure that this Bill when enacted will be enforced.

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to some general issues relating to the Bill.  I support the main thrust of the Bill, but it needs to be tightened up.  It tends to meander and is loosely drafted in regard to certain provisions.  There are inherent contradictions in some of the definitions. There is a need for greater clarity in regard to the definitions and I will table an amendment in that regard.  There are other areas of confusion in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are all electrical shops selling goods through hire purchase agreements to be included within the scope of the Bill? Will the retail side of the ESB's activities <Col N="1835" /> be included?  Why is it proposed to exclude the housing loan section of local authorities as the people who receive those loans are also consumers?  Why are the banks not included?  Are we creating categories of consumers?  The most streetwise of people find it difficult to keep pace with the different types of loans and terms being offered by banks. Transparency in respect of all transactions must be provided for under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Banks are included on all transparency options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I wish to refer to the section of the Bill dealing with house loans.  As the Minister said, the purchase of a house is likely to be the largest single transaction which most people make in their life and it is important to give such consumers maximum protection under law.</P>
      <P>This Bill goes a long way to reinforcing the rights of mortgage holders.  It is crucially important that all reasonable advice and support be given to all mortgage holders. It is more important that such support be given to those who fall into arrears with their repayments and that every conceivable effort be made to avert repossession. There are few eventualities, apart from sickness or death, in a family that creates so much anguish as the loss of a home by way of repossession.  At the minimum an early warning mechanism must be put in place and strictly enforced. A clear warning ought to be issued after the first payment is missed.  The consumer should have access at that point to debt advice services.  I would like the passing of this Bill to be reinforced with the provision of debt advice and debt management services.  Such services should be independent, accessible and user friendly.  Ideally they should be incorporated into services such as those provided in family resource centres or citizens advice bureaux.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an overwhelming need for a public education campaign to fully alert consumers to the possibilities and pitfalls <Col N="1836" /> of living in a consumer driven society and coping with credit and debt.  As I said at the outset, knowledge is power, and lack of knowledge very often means that people have to go to others, mainly lawyers, for vindication of their rights, at a substantial cost.  The fact that people will have recourse to the Office of Consumer Affairs is a major advance in consumer protection and service to the consumer.</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisions in the Bill which we will be seeking to amend. It is very long, complex and tortuous legislation, but it will be worthwhile to invest time, thought and energy into getting it right.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring one point to the notice of the Minister.  The Progressive Democrats have grave reservations about sections 5 (3) and 5 (4) which seem to infringe on the Supreme Court decision in the Re.  Haughey case, where the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts were found to be unconstitutional. I would like the Minister to consider that matter before Committee Stage.  The Progressive Democrats welcome the main thrust of the Bill.  I look forward to working on it on Committee Stage to ensure that when the Bill is finally passed it will be of enormous benefit to consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome many of the provisions in the Bill, which are overdue and which no doubt we will have an opportunity to examine in detail on Committee Stage.  Whereas the Bill is a reforming and modernising one, it entirely avoids the issue of credit discrimination. We are daily bombarded with advertisements which assume a minimum level of income on the part of the consumer that many consumers do not have.  As a result of this Bill the consumer will undoubtedly be better informed, but I do not think many consumers in the latter category to which I referred will necessarily have better options open to them.  Therefore I would argue that a more interventionist role by the State is required.  For example, there is a need to enhance and promote the role of credit unions.  In my experience <Col N="1837" /> credit unions tend to be most effective in long-established, stable working class communities; but they can be quite rare in some of the new urban working class areas, certainly in this city, and I suspect the position is no different elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, banks will not lend to low income groups.  Therefore there is no reason that they should not be levied, with the consequent revenue diverted to the credit unions to enable them to expand, develop and provide a service in the community that would prevent people from falling into the clutches of moneylenders.  This should be the case since the banks, without the necessary collateral, will not lend even small amounts of money that could keep people out of the clutches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to that.  I would like to see some of the data on it because it seems that the newer areas do not have credit union facilities, certainly to the extent as have more established, stable communities.  I am not clear why credit unions are excluded from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the reason that legislation with regard to credit unions is being updated.  I will come back with information on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to seeing that legislation.  However, I believe there is an argument for organisations such as credit unions to be included within the scope of this Bill, which has a special remit and which is different from other legislation.  For example, local authorities in the UK have a role in the expansion of the credit union facility in major cities there.  While consumers will have clearer and better information as a result of this Bill, there is nothing in it to provide greater protection to debtors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take up the point raised by Deputy Quill about the distinction <Col N="1838" /> between licensed and unlicensed moneylenders. I accept the argument, although I might not put it in the same terms as outlined by Deputy Quill, that licensed moneylenders are inevitable.  From experience in my constituency, and I am sure many other Deputies have had the same experience, for a variety of reasons &mdash; tradition, the demands of occasions such as First Holy Communion, Christmas or whatever &mdash; moneylending is regarded as an accessible and relatively easy, if not cheap, source of limited finance. Regardless of what we say in this House, that position will remain.  As long as the moneylender is licensed and there are regulations to supervise and monitor the operation of the system I do not see a great deal wrong with it.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the reference to the 10 a.m. start in terms of moneylenders. If one comes to my constituency at 10 a.m. on weekends one will see moneylenders at work, usually two people travelling together in big cars, one carrying data base, making their collections. Sadly, a great many of these people are not licensed, but in my direct experience they are parasites of the worst kind, who on occasion use intimidation and violence to get their money.  The ordinary consumer who falls into their clutches through a crisis in the family &mdash; it is usually the woman who conceals the fact from her spouse &mdash; is terrified of the knock on the door.  Very often one loan leads to another, the hole gets bigger and a major problem arises.  However, if moneylending is licensed and monitored, if there are reasonable limits on the practice and if there is clarity in the exchanges that take place, it is a phenomenon certainly of urban life, that is likely to remain.</P>
    <P>If moneylenders are going to stay with us, then, by definition, debtors are going to stay with us.  There is nothing in the Bill which will give any greater protection to debtors.  I question the efficacy of hauling people before the courts to discharge debts on the spot when it is patently evident to everyone that they cannot so discharge their debts on the spot.  Yet people are regularly dragged before the <Col N="1839" /> courts to discharge their debts, because that is the way we do it.  There must be a more efficacious way of doing this.  Of course, the most serious incidents relate to people who are hauled before the court to secure an order for the repossession of their homes because they cannot discharge mortgages, etc.  That area has to be looked at.  Threatening vulnerable people with court action when it is manifestly the case that they are not able to discharge small debts is probably counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The amount of data on this area available to us is very inadequate.  We do not know the real extent of moneylending.  I do not know the number of official licensed moneylenders.  In the last booklet on this subject on which I could lay my hands it is estimated that there are three unofficial unlicensed moneylenders for every licensed moneylender.  This booklet, which was produced by the Combat Poverty Agency &mdash; I am sure the Minister is familiar with it &mdash; is entitled <i>Moneylending and Low Income Families</i> and is written by Mary Daly and Jim Walsh.  An extraordinary amount of information in that booklet is based on a survey of people in hock, so to speak, to moneylenders and explains the factors which caused them to get into that situation in the first place, etc.  This booklet is very interesting.  However, generally speaking, there is a gap in the information available about the extent of this problem.  I suppose it is the case that the banks and other financial institutions have a very up to date data base on this issue; but, of course, they are especially secretive and they do not acknowledge that this is a question of public interest and, therefore, requiring transparency. Trying to get information out of the banks about one's state of indebtedness is bad enough but trying to get information from them in terms of formulating public policy and trying to cope with the problem of moneylending is virtually impossible. This is a gap which needs to be corrected.</P>
    <P>Subject to these reservations and a few others with which I will deal later, I generally <Col N="1840" /> welcome the Bill.  As has been said, the Bill goes beyond the requirements of the EU directive on consumer credit and will provide valuable protection for consumers in regard to advertising, information, rights of review, protection against exorbitant interest rates and unfair harassment.  Arrangements on credit, whether borrowing money, taking out a mortgage, getting a bank loan to buy a new car or simply buying a new television on hire purchase, are not agreements between two equal parties. The lender will normally be a big company or financial institution, with all the considerable power and resources that money can buy.  The borrower is normally an individual consumer with few resources and little support.  In the context it is appropriate that the legislative protection available to consumers should be the strongest possible.  The balance which has traditionally been towards the lender should now be tilted in favour of the borrower, provided of course that the resources necessary to enforce its provisions will be made available.</P>
    <P>In some cases, as with mortgages, a consumer is entering into the biggest financial commitment he or she is ever likely to undertake.  Mortgages of £60,000 and more are not unusual &mdash; I do not know what they will be like after the Finance Bill, but they have not been unusual up to now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of providing additional protection for consumers in terms of credit is a simple one, but the execution of the idea is a complex one, as the Bill illustrates.  There is now a whole array of companies and financial institutions <Col N="1841" /> offering credit through a dizzying range of deals and arrangements and in many respects one would need to be a legal expert to negotiate one's through some of those deals or, as the current advertisement says, &ldquo;Sure you'd have to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Inevitably then the Bill is a complex one, as is illustrated by the fact that the definitions alone extend to almost five pages.  These are complex mathematical formulae &mdash; to which I look forward to putting down amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Most of the provisions of the Bill are welcome and will greatly strengthen the hand of the consumer.  I particularly welcome the enhanced requirements regarding advertising. Despite the existing legislation consumers are still bombarded with the advertisements which at best fail to tell the full story and at worst are deliberately misleading.  We have all heard the radio advertisements offering new cars &ldquo;from £30 per week&rdquo; and it is only when the consumer responds to the advertisement <Col N="1842" /> that they find that this offer depends on them coming up with perhaps half of the value of the car &ldquo;cash down&rdquo;.  Of course, the aim of the advertisement is to attract the attention of the potential purchaser &mdash; and this is quite a legitimate objective &mdash; but it should not be permissible for it to be done in a dishonest or deliberately misleading way.</P>
      <P>The context in which this Bill has been most often demanded and promised over the past few years has been moneylending. It is important when talking about moneylending that we should differentiate between legal and illegal moneylending.  Illegal moneylending in working class areas is a social scourge which needs to be ruthlessly tackled.  It is by its nature unregulated and the combination of hugely exorbitant interest rates and the culture of intimidation and violence which often accompanies it has brought untold misery to many families.</P>
      <P>Legal moneylending could be regarded as a necessary social evil.  People, rich or poor, will always want to borrow money. Credit and the power to borrow should not be the sole preserve of the better off. Moneylending has often been referred to as &ldquo;the poor man's bank&rdquo;.  My view is that provided it is strictly regulated and supervised and provided interest rates are limited to a reasonable level, legal moneylending is something that can be tolerated and which inevitably will be availed of in low income communities and unemployment blackspots.  For some people on low incomes who do not have bank accounts, who have difficulties in making ends meet, who are not experienced at financial budgeting, who cannot meet the financial discipline required in a credit union and would not in any event be considered a &ldquo;good credit risk&rdquo; by a bank or financial institution, the system whereby somebody calls each week to collect a repayment may suit quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am concerned that far from increasing the level of supervision and monitoring of legal moneylending, this Bill will actually reduce it.  This Bill repeals in full the 25 section 1993 Moneylending Act and replaces it with a relatively short 16 section Part in this Bill. <Col N="1843" /> The 1933 Act set an absolute upper limit of 39 per cent on the rate of interest which could be charged.  No upper limit is specified in this Bill &mdash; the matter is to be left to the discretion of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I am concerned at how the concept of &ldquo;excessive interest&rdquo; will be defined in practice.  Deputy Bruton referred to section 46 (4) of the Bill which provides that the section does not apply to any credit advanced by a bank or mortgage lender.  That is a major question in itself.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to address the phrase, the concept of &ldquo;excessive interest&rdquo;.  I understand how that is supposed to work in theory but in practice I wonder how the Director of Consumer Affairs will deal with it.  It is my advice &mdash; and I am open to correction &mdash; that this concept is imported from British law, that it has been on the British Statute Book for well over a decade and, despite that, there have been only two cases in the courts there over that 12 or 13 year period.  It is a very important area.  My mind is not yet made up; I do not know whether it is a good measure to remove the 39 per cent absolute ceiling but I would like the Minister to explain why that ceiling should be removed, why it should be left to the discretion of the Director of Consumer Affairs, how he will make his decisions in all the circumstances and how practical it is to enforce it.  Under this Bill, no upper limit is specified, the matter is to be left to the discretion of the director and I would like to hear the Minister's view in this regard.</P>
    <P>Under the 1933 Act, a person who wishes to apply for a moneylender's licence or who wished to have it renewed had to apply to the District Court for a certificate of suitability.  When the certificate was issued, a licence was then automatically issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  An applicant had to publish a notice in a newspaper that the application was being made to the court and had to go before a judge to establish his or her suitability.  This procedure at least ensured that applications were a <Col N="1844" /> matter of public knowledge &mdash; or at least public record &mdash; and that people could and did go before a court and object to a certificate being issued where they believed this was appropriate.</P>
    <P>On occasion, gardaí have gone to court and objected to a certificate being issued. In July 1990, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Cork objected to a moneylender's licence being renewed because the applicant had been charging interest rates well in excess of the legally permitted level. In that case it was 70 per cent as against the 39 per cent ceiling specified in the law.</P>
    <P>The procedure under the 1933 Act was open and transparent and there is much to be said for it.  Under this Bill it appears that the granting of a licence will be exclusively a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs and that the procedures will be totally behind closed doors.  It does not appear that there will be any requirement to advertise an application or that there will be any facility to object to an application.  I do not in any way question the bona fides of the director or doubt that he will carry out his duties in anything but a conscientious way, but I wonder in what way does the Minister believe that the public interest is being served by these changes.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also that the Bill does not offer stronger measures to stamp out illegal moneylending.  The penalties have been increased, with the possibility of jail for offenders, and the Garda have received some additional powers, but I doubt if they will be sufficient to stamp out the problems of illegal moneylending which is endemic in working class urban communities.  Deputy Bruton referred to the efficacy of the remedy open to the consumer in these and, indeed, in other circumstances.  Many of my constituents who are in the clutches of illegal moneylenders would be unlikely to resort to the Director of Consumer Affairs to prosecute a case on their behalf because the very nature of the illegal moneylending business does not lend itself to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to additional legislative aids for gardaí to allow them to do their task in bringing a case to <Col N="1845" /> the stage where it might be prosecuted. Without that, we would not make much of an impact on the question of illegal moneylenders.  The penalties have been increased but it is a question of detection, prosecution and conviction.</P>
    <P>I accept there are no easy solutions. Huge profits are made by these illegal moneylenders.  A few examples of court cases in recent years illustrate the sort of money involved.  In January 1990 a court in Limerick was told that an unlicensed moneylender had charged an interest rate of 1,300 per cent.  In December of the same year a Dundalk court was told how another &ldquo;parasite&rdquo; had charged an unmarried mother 375 per cent and 728 per cent respectively on two loans.  The few cases which have come before the courts represent only the tip of the iceberg. Anyone who has experience of dealing with the unemployed or low income areas knows that illegal moneylending goes on but it is one of those social abuses on which it is extremely difficult to obtain specific information. The 1988 study undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency, to which I referred earlier, estimated that for every licensed moneylender there were three unlicensed operators.  Illegal moneylending is surrounded by a wall of silence because of the social stigma attached to it and the aura of fear that surrounds it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and one of the factors identified in the Combat Poverty Agency report was the role that tradition plays in this area and the recommendation by a parent or another family member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who borrow from illegal moneylenders suffer in silence.  In many cases, husbands or wives borrow money without the knowledge of their spouses and then face the terrible ordeal of trying to make the repayments alone.  Illegal moneylenders make hay at those times of the year when financial pressures on families are greatest &mdash; Christmas, back to school, First Holy Communions and so on.  The <Col N="1846" /> Combat Poverty Agency study found that the greatest single reason for taking out a loan was Christmas but that a surprising number of people also had to borrow simply to meet regular household debts. People who take out one loan find themselves being pressured to take out another to finance the repayments of the first.  If loan repayments are not met, people are threatened, intimidated and, on some occasions, subjected to violence.</P>
    <P>That is why the particular cut of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; that relates to the role of the community welfare officer is an unfortunate one in many respects.  Whatever argument can be advanced for some of the other cuts, that particular one should be repealed.  My favourite Minister of State, Deputy Burton, comes into this House, becoming more indignant on each occasion and tells us that it has been repealed.  I am sure other Deputies present will agree that local community welfare supervisors in any of the constituencies will say that that has not happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>Not everyone in the House can have the relationship that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, and I have.  However, there is a real issue here and that is that many poor people previously had access to the community welfare officer for assistance with paying ESB bills and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Everybody is in agreement on this but with Minister Burton's indignation and the <Col N="1847" /> Minister, Deputy Woods, baffling everyone with science, nothing has changed on the ground.</P>
      <P>If everyone knows that this business goes on, why are there not more prosecutions? That is a question that can be appropriately addressed to the Garda and whether they consider they have the wherewithal to enhance the prosecution rate.  The traditional Garda response has been that they can only investigate specific cases where complaints have been made.  I do not believe this approach is good enough.  Nobody could imagine the Garda adopting a position in regard to the drugs problem, of saying that they can only investigate complaints.  One of the specific recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency report was that the Garda should be resourced to carry out an intensive campaign to identify and prosecute moneylenders and those who are operating unlawfully.  That recommendation suggested that a senior officer could be appointed at both national and regional levels to oversee enforcement of the law and circulate information about the law in this matter.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon of people being forced to resort to moneylenders will be with us until we, as a society, ensure that those on social welfare and in low paid jobs receive a decent income which can sustain them and their dependants adequately.  Those who most frequently turn to moneylenders are people on social welfare.  In many cases the social welfare rates are simply inadequate to maintain people in any reasonable degree of dignity and comfort.  The general social welfare increases granted in the budget were minimalist.  The policy of increasing payments in line with inflation would be acceptable only if the basic rates were adequate but that is not the case.  While the rates have finally moved towards the priority levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 &mdash; those levels were regarded as being urgent then &mdash; they are still below the minimum level set by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The virtual abolition of pay-related benefits will drive even more people into <Col N="1848" /> the clutches of moneylenders.  Pay-related benefit, which was intended to be a cushion for those who became unemployed, before going onto unemployment benefit has been abolished.</P>
    <P>A number of other general issues need to be referred to.  Clearly under the Bill the Director of Consumer Affairs will have to take on a greatly enhanced role. I note that the Minister has promised him additional staff.  I hope this will be done because a feature of successive reports of the Director of Consumer Affairs has been the complaint that he has been unable to satisfactorily discharge his functions because of staff shortages.  For instance, in his 1991 report the Director of Consumer Affairs said he could not provide a breakdown of the outcome of cases due to the lack of staff resources. He said that more staff on the complaints line would allow more complaints to be processed and noted that a shortage of staff was causing problems for his mediation sevices.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs also made the very valid point that his office cannot be as independent as it should be when the question of staffing and resources is out of his hands.  While the Bill gives him a greatly expanded role, he will remain dependent on the Department providing the necessary resources. A malicious Minister &mdash; which, of course, the Minister most emphatically is not &mdash; could set out to frustrate the Director of Consumer Affairs in the exercise of his new responsibilities under this Bill by simply withholding staff or resources. Given the importance of his new duties I should like to see a provision in the Bill which would give the Director of Consumer Affairs a statutory right to all of the staff and resources he needs to reasonably discharge his duties.</P>
    <P>I would like to have referred to bank charges.  However, when Deputy Richard Bruton was leaving on his urgent and, I believe, successful mission, he was about to take up that point.  I am sure he will now.  The Minister of State has answered a series of parliamentary questions, including some tabled by me, on this issue.  She has received tremendous <Col N="1849" /> publicity &mdash; of which she is a great exponent, as this morning's papers bear out &mdash; saying that she was going to address this question of exorbitant bank charges in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet there is nothing in this Bill that addresses that question.  I am afraid the Minister will present us with an amendment on Committee Stage when there will not be adequate time to consult, obtain advice and so on.  That is a major omission from the Bill.  Indeed, the Minister of State has recently on introducing Bills and, on important matters, tended to ask us not to worry, not to criticise her because there is an amendment on the way and asks us to wait until we see the amendment when we will be very happy with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbittee said, the issue of bank charges should be clearly addressed.  Clearly the Minister of State made a promise, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 23 October last, when she was reported as saying that there would be controls on the proposed bank charges in the Bill.  That has not happened.  She clearly indicated also that she believed that the charges on credit cards were excessive, leading the consumer to believe that this Bill would address this matter in section 46 where the Director of Consumer Affairs could take issue with the level of charge being imposed on credit cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of bank charges has become extremely contentious with consumers. What we are having is a welter of charges stipulated by the banks that completely confuse the consumer as to the true value for money available from the different lending agencies.  Indeed they are designed in that way.  Clearly, it would be in consumers' interests to have charges <Col N="1851" /> at a minimum and let the banks live out of the margin they have between their lending and deposit rates.  At present those margins are handsome.  The annual report of the Central Bank showed the spread between lending and borrowing rates.  On commercial lending at present the banks have a margin of almost ten percentage points between their lending and borrowing rates and, on house mortgages, almost six percentage points.  The onus is on the banks to prove that any extra charges are necessary as well as this considerable margin.  The Minister of State will know that the present arrangements are highly unsatisfactory and that the relationship between the banks and the Central Bank in regard to increasing these charges is a completely closed book.  The Central Bank has no remit for the consumer.  It sees itself as operating purely in terms of prudential risk and protecting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a remit under legislation but it says it cannot function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In practice no one knows the criteria on which it decides the reasonableness of charges. Many of the charges are perceived as unreasonable and in many instances are not brought to the attention of borrowers. Many borrowers on overdraft are amazed to discover that they are charged £3.50 per transaction if they exceed a certain limit on their account.</P>
      <P>The need for such charges should be justified before a body that would assess consumer interests, just as is provided for under sections 46 and 48 of this Bill. That would ensure that the terms of the credit arrangement are transparent, are available to the Director of Consumer Affairs and be challengeable by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, in reply to a parliamentary question, pointed to some interview she gave as reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i>.  I checked her reference to that.  The amendment suggested in the article would be very unsatisfactory.  It appears that the Director of Consumer Affairs will have an opportunity to talk <Col N="1852" /> to the Central Bank before it sanctions these charges.  That is making a goose of one and a gander of the other in that we are providing that all other lending agencies should be subjected not only to scrutiny but challenge by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The Minister's first thoughts on this issue &mdash; which were behind her interview reported on 23 October last &mdash; were right, that she should not be deflected by arguments that must have been put to her in the meantime to back down on this.  I hope she will not make do with the rather weak provision she appeared to be suggesting when she was interviewed by the <i>Sunday Press.</i></P>
    <P>We need transparency in this area.  The consumer is entitled to it.  The Consumer Credit Bill should make provision for codes for practice which the Director could lay down for the operation of credit in general.  Under present law he only has that right in relation to information. This provision has been used to provide for the APR statement.  Equally, people have a right to a code of practice in relation to the operation of credit.  For example, they should be informed if credit rating or other such procedures are being used.  Credit rating and credit scoring is a commonly used procedure in respect of income.  In the UK rules regarding fairness in the operation of such procedures have been established. People must be informed if credit scoring is being used and they must receive written reasons as to why they have been refused credit.</P>
    <P>There should be very strict control in cases where one credit institution is passing on information about the credit worthiness of a consumer to another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that.  Section 118 does not refer to codes of practice but to regulations regarding the passing of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important provision but we should devise a code of practice for the Director to guide the way in which credit will be offered.  At present <Col N="1853" /> he can only use the Consumer Information Bill.</P>
      <P>Other issues have been raised which will need to be looked at on Committee Stage.  Threshold has signalled the need for an early warning of difficulties in relation to unpaid mortgages.  There should be a default notice which would alert people to the first appearance of arrears in payment and provide them with information on how arrears should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take the initiative and disseminate information about credit options and how people can exercise their rights.  They must have easy access to such information.</P>
      <P>While there is much that is good in this Bill there is still a way to go before the Minister can satisfy us that the credit issue has been satisfactorily tackled and that consumers have equal rights in what has been up to now a very one-sided relationship.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for her long-standing interest in consumer affairs.  I remember speaking in a debate on consumer affairs in the Seanad and the Minister clearly signalled her intention to introduce legislation to deal with the problems in relation to credit.  I am glad she has had the opportunity to bring this Bill before us.  Very often, Ministers who bring legislation to a certain point do not get the opportunity to see it through.</P>
      <P>The issue of credit is a complex one. Hardly a day goes by without some new credit product coming on the market. Very often the terms of such products are extremely complex, obscure and unintelligible to the consumer.  They are defined in legal jargon which is beyond the understanding of the average person. I am talking about those parts of the contracts which are effectively written in small print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The products are sold in simplistic terms using the experience and knowledge of psychologists and experts in <Col N="1854" /> market research.  The big institutions have the capacity to research the market and understand the drives and impulses which entice consumers to use their products. The consumer is at the receiving end of this carefully worked out strategy. The dice is loaded against the consumer. To that extent, it is good to see that the balance is now being restored in favour of the consumer.  However, the consumer will be inevitably at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> credit institutions and there is nothing the Minister can do about that.</P>
    <P>It is important that some effort be made to redress the imbalance.  We live in a consumer society.  In the words of the late John Healy, the precept in the consumer society is &ldquo;thou shalt consume&rdquo;. That psychological drive in the human subconscious is exploited by various agencies who show people pleasant images and encourage them to aspire to their attainment.  Unfortunately their efforts to do so can end in unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill that warning notices be put on contracts advising consumers that they risk losing their house and so on.  Such warnings are a step in the right direction but their effectiveness is limited, given the experience with the health warning on cigarette packets.  Nonetheless they are welcome and given that there is not the same sense of addiction involved they may be more effective.  It is appropriate that some effort be made to tilt the balance back in favour of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Most consumers now buy goods on the basis of credit.  The days when people paid cash are to a large extent gone.  It is a pity that that society has to some degree faded away.  Those who worked on that basis and paid cash down were a worthy type of person.  Many of these people built up the country in the past.  They were people of commitment; they believed in honesty and in fair dealing. The modern world to some degree has moved away from that.  It is a pity we have left behind some of the good things which were a feature of that society.  Of course, time moves on and we cannot <Col N="1855" /> stand still.  We have got to live with credit, and that is what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Bill is acting on the commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government. Indeed, I compliment the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment for fulfilling the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The old adage that one should neither a borrower nor a lender be is still worth thinking about, although society has moved on from those concepts.  It is worth examining those concepts with a view to salvaging some of their valuable aspects; but of course credit is part of modern commerce and I am not making the argument that we should have a society which does not have credit.  That would be ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Some years ago an ombudsman for credit institutions was appointed to investigate complaints in respect of banks and building societies.  That was a worthwhile initiative.  It is important that some of the concerns which existed at that time should be catered for in this legislation. Deputy Quill made a valid point in regard to a debt advice service which I hope the Minister will examine with a view to acting on it.  Unfortunately, the way in which people respond to the problem of debt makes it worse.  I hope some type of advice can be provided for people who are in debt so that, as they say in politics, &ldquo;When you are in a hole at least stop digging&rdquo;.  Many people are in that position because of the unfortunate experiences they have had.  Many are on low incomes and in difficult circumstances and are vulnerable to moneylenders and so on.</P>
    <P>In her opening remarks the Minister of State said that moneylending was there since biblical times.  It would be naive of us to pretend it would be possible to eliminate moneylending as a problem in society.  The best that can be done is to try to reduce the undesirable aspects of moneylending to a tolerable level.  The Bill makes reasonable progress in that regard.  I welcome the initiatives contained <Col N="1856" /> in it to curtail and curb some of the more ugly aspects of moneylending.</P>
    <P>I welcome the role for the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to the control of moneylending and the licensing of people who will engage in moneylending. However, I wish to sound a note of concern in regard to the amount of resources available to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This has been an ongoing problem for the Director and the staff in his office for a number of years.  I am pleased that the Minister has said that extra staff will be provided for him. Unless staff are available it will not be possible for the Director to deal with the problems.  I experienced difficulty in getting through on the telephone to the office of the Director, either because there were not sufficient lines or enough people to answer the telephone.  I admit that some considerable time has elapsed since I tried to telephone the office, but I hope that problem can be addressed.  It is important that the public have access to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  In the case of small problems, most people nowadays are inclined to telephone the office rather than write to the Director.  The average person can probably get that advice in a more coherent and useful way by way of interaction through a telephone conversation rather than setting down the problem on paper and waiting for the Director to respond.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill in relation to controlling and curbing moneylending, especially those provisions which will now make it illegal for moneylenders to hold social welfare books and pension books as collateral against a loan.  That is a highly desirable step and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that records of transactions with moneylenders will have to be kept and held for a five year period to ensure, in the event of a dispute occurring, that the interests of consumers are protected.  I also welcome the fact that moneylenders will be obliged to spell out clearly to the consumer the terms of the agreement and that moneylenders will be precluded from giving false advice &mdash; for example, giving the impression that a <Col N="1857" /> certain amount of money is being lent when in fact that total amount is considerably less.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to bank charges.  I would like to see the control of bank charges being assigned to the Director of Consumer Affairs and I hope the Minister will be able to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that that happens.  It is important that the balance in relation to bank charges be tilted further in the direction of the consumer. The average consumer is completely bewildered in relation to bank charges.  I do not understand them and I do not have the time to spend studying them in order to come to grips with their various aspects.  I wish a simplified version could be provided so that the average person could understand what is involved.  If that is not possible perhaps a basic guideline could be made available which would cover most bank charges.  I understand there may be complex bank charges for those involved in major transactions. One would hope that a simple guideline, consisting of two or three points, could be provided for the average customer.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that there is an unequal balance between credit institutions and the consumer.  The credit institutions work in mysterious and inscrutable ways.  I have always been fascinated by the manner in which banks have used advertising.  I have been particularly fascinated by the slogans that some of the banks have used in the past, and especially the call from one of the banks: &ldquo;Come in and say hello&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps for £30 they will be inclined to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to you.  Let us try to imagine the response if one were to visit a series of banks in the city, going from teller to teller, saying &ldquo;I have taken up your offer, I am coming in to say hello&rdquo;.  I presume they would have ways in which to curb that.  Obviously, one is not expected to take those slogans literally and yet there is a driving psychology behind them.  This slogan is not <Col N="1858" /> made up by some eccentric advertising person; it is designed to latch on to some deep anxiety in the human mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to sell a message or to create an impression.  What is meant by slogans such as &ldquo;The bank of a lifetime&rdquo;? It is meaningless, but it touches a chord. Then there is the bank that takes one on a radio tour of potholes of County Cavan which, after the site at Mullaghmore, must be one of the great national tourist attractions.  After the tour the car is wrecked and you will need an auto loan. You can say that this is a joke and fun, but it is not funny.  These advertisements are designed to generate custom, they also include small print and carefully worded phrases, advice from legal and accountancy experts and various other marketing people who have all been drawn into this two pronged attack. People are encouraged to drop in but when things go wrong the customer is nobbled and on the wrong side of the counter.  The bank manager will press a button and lo and behold the sheriff in full colour will arrive to look over the house to see if there is anything worth taking.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill and on her efforts in this whole area over the last five or six years, if not longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers I compliment and congratulate the Minister on introducing this substantial Bill.  She has already indicated her determination to progress this legislation as quickly as possible.  I am glad we are now discussing legislation likely to have major beneficial implications for those who obtain credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that giving credit has mushroomed recently to such an extraordinary extent that it is a huge industry. A great many individuals live off the benefits of giving credit or arranging credit for others.  All these intermediaries cost <Col N="1859" /> money and the person using the credit facility is usually the person who pays all the charges.  The Minister has taken an opportunity in the Bill to tackle this issue and lay down very strict criteria for the performance of intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Included in a number of areas associated with this legislation is the question of legal and illegal moneylending. Moneylending has been going on for a long time.  There have been attempts to tackle the more notorious aspects of illegal moneylending over the years with some success, but, unfortunately, a great deal remains to be done.  This legislation will make a major contribution to bring to heel those engaged in illegal moneylending which is causing great difficulties for families.  Money is almost immediately available at very high interest rates from illegal moneylenders and difficulties arise for people in repaying the borrowings. I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to ensure that it will be illegal for moneylenders to hold social welfare books.  This practice developed in fairly recent times as it was obvious to the lender that the social welfare book was an asset that guaranteed not just eventual payment but payment in time.  In our constituencies many of us have come across individuals who literally had nothing to live on because social welfare books were held by unscrupulous moneylenders. It seems to me that such people were breaking the law in relation to the holding and cashing of the sums in social welfare books.  In any event, it was a deplorable practice.</P>
    <P>There is a great temptation to seek credit because of the powerful nature of advertising which persuades people who may not be able to afford it, to buy a facility or goods.  With the help of credit people believe that they can afford to spend when, strictly speaking, they cannot.  The methods of providing credit have become extremely complex and advertising has become extremely persuasive.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is devoted to credit agreements which have become extraordinarily complex.  Any credit <Col N="1860" /> agreement worth its salt usually runs to a couple of pages, the typeface is very small and a tremendous amount of information is packed into it.  Sentences, sections and paragraphs refer backwards or forwards to other parts of the agreement and affect the operation of sections of the agreement and language which is difficult for the ordinary consumer is used.  The agreements are complex and difficult to understand and are placed before the borrowers who are usually ill at ease and unable to think clearly about what they propose to do and the type of agreement they propose to enter into.</P>
    <P>Section 31 makes it quite clear that the consumer is entitled to certain specific information.  Among the items of information to which the consumer is entitled are cash price and credit price.  This is very important because many people enter into agreements which might extend over a number of years without understanding the precise amount of money they will have to pay.  They may know the monthly amount but do not fully understand the agreement into which they are entering.  This scenario relates particularly to leasing and lease purchase arrangements.  Often the borrower will sit down with the provider of such a facility and the provider will say that he must pay £X per month over 24, 36 or 48 months and that at the end of that time the debt will be paid.  However, when one comes to the end of the term of repayments one often finds that is not the case and one does not own the item for which one has entered a lease purchase agreement.  The wrong impression is created from the start and one is faced with further fees in order to acquire an interest in the asset.  These are complex areas which are not clearly spelled out in the agreements I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Another question is the amount of interest to be paid.  Sometimes there are difficulties because people are under the impression that they are making fixed monthly repayments over the period of the agreement.  However, they may find for a variety of reasons they are charged additional interest.  This may arise because the interest rate has changed or <Col N="1861" /> from slight delays in making repayments. The additional interest charged may seem punitive.  Sometimes there are built in penalty clauses and one may find at the end of the first or second year that one still owes a substantial amount over and above what one agreed to pay back in the first place.</P>
    <P>The credit card industry is booming and I welcome the provision for an agreement which will have to spell out in detail the credit card arrangements.  The requirement that information be provided in the credit agreement makes a major contribution to the success of this legislation.  I welcome also the Minister's decision to ensure that in most cases a ten day cooling off period for those who enter into credit agreements will apply. We all know that some individuals feel under pressure to enter into a credit arrangement as quickly as possible lest difficulties arise which will impede their ability to get the deal they are looking for.  One is expected to take in two, three or four pages of complex information which may be couched in a strange and unfamiliar manner and one has no opportunity to withdraw from the agreement. On further reflection or having discussed the matter with a partner a person may find the deal is not attractive and difficulties that have not been thought of become apparent.  The cooling off period will give the consumer a great deal of protection and gives him or her the opportunity to make choices after the immediate pressure of concluding an agreement in the first instance.  The Minister is to be complimented for including this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of contributors who referred to moneylending also referred to the role of the credit unions.  The Minister is particularly supportive of their work.  The credit union is a financial institution which is close to the people and those who work in it are generally from the area and tend to be respected members of the community.  One would like to see the continued extension of credit union offices to every parish in the country. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has been to the fore in supporting <Col N="1862" /> the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in assisting people to extricate themselves from the clutches of illegal moneylenders.  It has enjoyed a substantial success, particularly in areas where there has been a tradition of using moneylenders and people have been unable to ascertain whether the moneylender is prepared to act in an honourable fashion.  I know from discussions with various individuals involved in the credit union movement and in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that they are supportive of the consultative process carried out by the Minister and welcome this Bill, which they believe will make a major contribution to the orderly extension of credit and to strengthening the rights of consumers when they enter into agreement of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister is waging a campaign against bank charges and is committed to making changes in this area.  If the banks do not come clean on the range of charges levied on customers and ensure that people are treated fairly and given all the information to which they are entitled, they may find themselves on the wrong side of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for bringing forward this legislation which will be hotly debated.  It will make a major contribution to the orderly development of credit facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often noticed the same in the Lenihan family.</P>
      <P>This Bill consists of ten sections and seeks to create a statutory body to be called the National Bureau of Crime Statistics whose members would be the director of the Central Statistics Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Accounting Officer of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, an assistant Garda commissioner, a prison governor, a judge of the High Court and a representative of the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice as nominated by the Minister for Justice.  The bureau's terms of reference would be to measure accurately the levels of crime and report on these annually by 31 March and to compare increases or decreases from period to period with analyses as to the actual levels of crime together with any comments they feel are helpful in dealing with the crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I published this Bill is that I do not believe the current crime statistics reflect the true levels of crime, rather that they reflect the true levels of reported crime, which is a different matter. Second, I am concerned that the prison statistics are regularly published many years in arrears.  Following the publication <Col N="1864" /> of this Bill the prison statistics for two or three years were placed in the Dáil Library.  Third, the Whitaker report on penal reform recommended that there should be such a body to present accurate prison statistics such as early releases, the length of sentence served, the type of sentence, the number of prisoners released, the circumstances in which they were released and matters of that kind. Finally, the Law Reform Commission in its report on sentencing recommended that statistics on sentencing should be available to which judges and legislators could refer when deciding on sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>Week in, week out we pass legislation which includes the words &ldquo;six months and/or £500&rdquo; or &rdquo;12 months and/or £1,000&rdquo; etc.  Judges have no way of knowing the length of sentence being served, whether full sentences are being served, and which are successful.  For example, are community work orders more successful than some prison sentences?  Some judges decide that the full sentence should not be applied; in other words, if they decide to impose a two year sentence they will say to a person that they will bring them back in one year and review the sentence.  Some judges use this to good effect.  Other judges decide to suspend half a sentence and depending on a person's behaviour they may decide to suspend the balance.  If information, data and statistics were available which judges and legislators could draw on they would be able to see whether these are successful. The point I am trying to make is that there is no adequate scientific data available.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner does not like to hear me say this but it is my duty to say that the crime statistics published annually by the Garda Commissioner do not reflect the true levels of crime in this country, even though these statistics are alarming in themselves.  It is impossible to draw up any meaningful plans to tackle crime in the absence of statistics which would indicate the extent of the crime problem.</P>
    <P>The first thing that anyone would do in preparing any plan and starting any <Col N="1865" /> fight-back against crime or disease is to measure accurately the true levels under various categories.  One would then make provision for a review &mdash; I suggest an annual review &mdash; to see if we were reducing the levels but that is not the case here. Since we do not start from this premise we do not have a proper plan in place to tackle crime; all we have are highly publicised reactionary methods which do not form part of a plan which begins with statistics and ends with reform of prisons.</P>
    <P>The statistics available on criminal activities presented in the Garda Commissioner's annual reports do not accurately reflect the true levels of crime. Many people know that there is no point in reporting crime and do not bother to do so.  While some little information is available on crime the position in relation to other aspects of the criminal justice system is almost farcical.  As far back as 1985 the Whitaker report on the penal system concluded that complexities are the reality of the criminal justice system but that given the present state of criminal justice statistics their frequency cannot be measured.  Whitaker states and I quote: &ldquo;This lack of information is not merely a nuisance which hinders research, it is a feature of the criminal justice system that decisions are taken at one stage in ignorance of what is occurring elsewhere in the system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on sentencing, eight or nine years later, indicated that the situation had not changed and stated that any recommendations ultimately made in its report on sentencing would be rendered comparatively ineffective by the absence of proper information.  It stated that details of every sentence in every court and of every instance of election for trial venue by judge, prosecution or accused should be recorded and speedily retrievable. That is the central matter.  While it may not be very interesting to read or write about a national bureau of crime statistics, unless we start from this point we are going nowhere.  In this regard the Minister should note what I said about the Whitaker committee and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> The statistics relating to the prison system must be regarded as a joke.  If memory serves me correctly, in 1988 three prison reports for a number of previous years were published.  Subsequent to that, in or about July of last year, the reports for 1988 and 1989 were published. Before Christmas last year the annual report for prisons and places of detention for 1991 was published.  These reports were placed in the Library unannounced. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The most up-to-date report available for the Probation and Welfare Service is that for 1989-90, which was also published in December 1993.  How can anyone have any view in relation to alternatives to imprisonment if the report of the agency which deals with these alternatives is so many years out-of-date? How can we know, for instance, how effective these rehabilitation programmes are &mdash; programmes such as community service orders, programmes involving the use of workshops or other supervisory programmes conducted by the Probation and Welfare Service &mdash; if we have no details of what has occurred in these areas since 1989?</P>
    <P>As the main Opposition spokesman on Justice how can I hope to put together some sort of researched view to present the views of this party?  How can the Minister put together Government policy without having up-to-date statistics?  The only thing we do know is that at that stage the Probation and Welfare Service was grossly understaffed and that that has not changed in the meantime.</P>
    <P>There are no statistics available in regard to the courts.  Nobody seems to know the position in relation to the collection of fines, sentencing for various types of crime etc.  I could go on, but all I could do would be to show that there are no statistics in relation to what is happening in regard to sentencing. Recently the Minister for Justice announced a £66 million plan to tackle crime.  It is not significant that not one penny of that £66 million is earmarked for researching the penal system or the courts system?  Eminent commentators have stated that given the relatively small <Col N="1867" /> size of the jurisdiction as a whole, even 0.5 of 1 per cent of this amount would provide sufficient funds for a substantial research programme.  We cannot even begin to tackle crime until such time as we know the extent of the problem.  Filling potholes here and there in the system will not solve the problem.  The Law Reform Commission's report on sentencing recommended the setting up of an agency staffed by experts to conduct the necessary research and provide statistics.  Fine Gael fully agrees with this recommendation. Accordingly, I ask for the support of the House for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 January 1994, written by Messrs.  Tom O'Malley and Ian O'Donnell.  Mr. Tom O'Malley is a lecturer in law at University College Galway and Mr. Ian O'Donnell is research officer, University of Oxford Centre for Criminological Research.  In this article they are critical of what they say is a criminal justice policy imprisoned by a lack of imagination.</P>
    <P>This article says much about the total lack of imagination and reactionary approach of the Department of Justice. There seems to be a view that plenty of legislation, with money thrown at it here and there, will look good in the House and in the newspapers and make it appear that the Department is doing something about the problem.  The Minister might as well have called the £66 million package a £550 million package, because she is saying she will provide this money over a number of years.  However, £66 million sounds the sort of figure one might get away with if one were trying to be taken seriously.  How are we to really tackle the cowboys selling drugs openly on the streets, or the people who have have caused out old folk to retreat behind closed doors after daylight hours &mdash; and sometimes even during daylight hours &mdash; or the people who constantly steal cars and vandalise property to get their kicks and who have brought about the situation where, not just in urban areas, people are living behind shutters and alarms or living on roads with ramps, because even <Col N="1868" /> in rural areas people are afraid to come to the door to meet a stranger who may be looking for directions?  If we are to even begin to fight back against these cowboys, these criminals, the first thing to do is to measure the level of the problem.</P>
    <P>I stress that it is as much a rural problem now as an urban problem.  Younger people, who might be expected to protect the older members of the community in rural areas, have emigrated.  The older members are now more vulnerable. Somebody recently told me that some older members of his constituency are moving in from rural areas and closer to villages in order to feel safer.  What are we doing to protect them?  We are talking about legislation and about a £66 million plan.  It is a cod.  If we are serious about a plan, let us start at the beginning.</P>
    <P>In this article it stated:</P>
    <P>The Irish Criminal Justice Research Centre, of which both present writers are directors, was established a year ago with the aims of conducting empirical research on the criminal justice system including sentencing practice, providing a resource and documentation centre for others, including State officials, working in the area of criminology and penology, and organising regular seminars which would act as a forum for the exchange of ideas and the promulgation of research findings. So far, however, despite our best efforts, we have failed to attract any State financial support, and the package of measures now announced leaves us less than optimistic about the future.</P>
    <P>That is what these eminent writers jointly had to say about the co-called £66 million package without research, research which they are trying to carry out themselves voluntarily because the State will not do it.  Why will the State not do it? What has the State got to fear?  Is the Minister afraid that we might all get to know the extent of the problem and see clearly that there is such a dreadful lack of resources to adequately tackle the problem and that she will be shown up for what she is &mdash; a Minister without <Col N="1869" /> a real crime policy, let alone a crime package?</P>
    <P>I am also grateful to Dr. Paul O'Mahony, a psychologist formerly with the Department of Justice, for his book, <i>Crime and Punishment</i> published earlier this year.  I would like to quote certain sections of it.  He talks about the overall picture in a paragraph headed &ldquo;The mysterious criminal justice process&rdquo;.  He says:</P>
    <P>At this point a complete and fully elaborated understanding of the reality of crime and punishment in Ireland is at best a distant and elusive goal.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, we lack much basic information about the criminal justice process in all its phases from the commission of crime to release from prison.  Such information is a prerequisite of a full and proper understanding and appraisal of the Irish criminal justice process.</P>
    <P>Second, much of the information we do have is inconsistent and even self-contradictory to a level which makes drawing confident conclusions impossible or, at any rate, unwise.</P>
    <P>He also stated:</P>
    <P>The area of official statistics is an obvious example of the lack of cohesion and co-operation between the three branches.  The police and the prisons do not even use the same classification of offences.  The court system barely keeps a statistical record at all. However, the lack of co-ordination spreads far beyond record-keeping into very significant areas which impact on the essential nature of the penal system.</P>
    <P>The most serious and obvious example of conflict of aims and action between the branches of the criminal justice system is the widespread, effective reduction of sentence by the prison administration due to accommodation pressures in the prison system.  A judge ponders long and hard, taking offence, offender, and all the surrounding, possibly mitigating or possibly aggravating, circumstances into account, <Col N="1870" /> before he or she decides on a suitable sentence.  Sometime later, a fortunate offender may find himself out on the street again, having served a third, a quarter, or even less of that sentence. This is surely a travesty of the court and judicial system and everything it stands for, as well as an undoubted provocation to the victims and the police officers, who will have worked on the detection and prosecution of the case.  It is certainly a clear example of how the constituent elements of the criminal justice system work at odds with each other.</P>
    <P>Clearly, an essential step towards a comprehensive understanding of the operation of the Irish criminal justice system is the drawing up of a reliable, detailed map of the process, with which we can describe and trace how events unfold and what actually happens to people as they are processed through the various stages.</P>
    <P>I deliberately read those quotations because they are an indictment of our lack of professionalism.  We are operating the &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; mentality in which we issue a statement and introduce harsh legislation, some of which is not aimed at criminals but at law abiding citizens. For example, that was the case in respect of some sections of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, but the Minister had the good sense to delete those provisions on the advice of Members before the legislation was passed.  Some of our criminal justice legislation is aimed at ordinary law abiding citizens, it is a reactionary measure not based on any proper fundamental statistics.  Those are not my words but the words of Dr. Paul O'Mahony a former psychologist in the Department of Justice, Tom O'Malley from UCC and Ian O'Donnell of the Centre for Criminological Research at Oxford University.</P>
    <P>When I raised those points originally, a few people's noses were put out of joint.  They did not like to hear those statements, but that is tough because I will do my job and they should do theirs. My job is to speak in the national interest. <Col N="1871" /> What I said is substantiated by the people I quoted here this evening.  Dr. O'Mahony went on to state:</P>
    <P>Information is the lifeblood of institutional policy and decision-making, and the lack of information is another important source of chaos in the Irish criminal justice system.  In this study there have been many occasions on which it was necessary to regret a lack of basic information.  In many areas official data collection and the compiling of statistics is completely missing, in others it is in an incomprehensible mess.  This is not just a shame for the statisticians and other eccentrics who actually enjoy working with figures, it is a disaster for the system itself.  Lack of information on the present scale condemns the system to endless blind stumbling in the darkness of incoherence and self-contradiction. Information alone will not solve the problems of the criminal justice system, but it is essential if these problems are ever to be solved.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Mahony, in quoting a civil servant from the New Zealand Ministry of Justice who sums up the situation nicely, stated:</P>
    <P>You know you're really in a third world country, when you can no longer afford to record the progress of your own decline.</P>
    <P>This is clearly an area which must be addressed urgently.  Official statistics must be put on a sure footing and the administration should grasp the great opportunities for effective, routine data collection and analysis presented by modern computer technology.</P>
    <P>The present sloppy approach to statistics and low priority placed on research and data collection are unacceptable in themselves.  They also indicate that the system is currently subject to a highly questionable style of management and forward planning, which apparently feels that it can function without even attempting to obtain a full understanding of what goes on.  In this context, the recent recommendation <Col N="1872" /> of the Law Reform Commission for an official research unit to collect data on and examine court sentencing practice is timely and can be unambiguously endorsed.</P>
    <P>Is there any more to be said?  Can any defence be made against that?  I will re-read the quotation from the official of the New Zealand Ministry of Justice, but I wish it was a quotation from the Minister for Justice here.  That civil servant stated, &ldquo;You know you're really in a third world country, when you can no longer afford to record the progress of your own decline&rdquo;.  Is there anybody in the academic world or other respected organisation whom we would take seriously if they came to us with a plan to deal with a problem and asked for money?  This is the parliament of a country, the only authority who can take money from the people.  If a person does not have statistics or research material we would not give him or her any money.  Why then should we give the Minister for Justice money to use in whatever manner she likes when she does not give this House the true data and statistics in relation to the prison system, sentencing policy and the position in relation to crime on which we could evaluate the budgetary proposals put forward by her?</P>
    <P>I did not grow up in a city where people had to have alarms on their houses, shops and cars, where ramps on roads were the order of the day to prevent people stealing cars and driving them at speed along residential streets and where shutters were placed on shop windows as a matter of routine.  In the Dublin in which I grew up people window-shopped on a Sunday afternoon in O'Connell Street. As a young boy I was able to go on my own from my house in Inchicore to the Phoenix Park to see President Kennedy. My daughter is slightly older now than I was at the time President Kennedy visited this country, but I would not allow her to go down the road on her own; such is the extent of the crime problem.  Yet, we refuse to start on a professional footing by providing scientific information to analyse the extent of the crime problem <Col N="1873" /> and the success in tackling it so that we can keep on top of it.  If we refuse to start at that basic level, how can anyone take us seriously?  I would like to share my time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>

      <P>This Bill should not involve a charge on the Exchequer.  The people whom I propose should form this bureau are people of stature who are already on the public payroll.  They include the Director of the Central Statistics Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General, an Accounting Officer of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, an assistant Garda commissioner, a prison governor, a High Court judge and a representative of the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice to be nominated by the Minister for Justice.  The establishment of the bureau would involve statutorily bringing those people together, giving them power and authority to enable them give Members basic information relating to crime to enable us take on the criminals.  I hope the Minister will accept the Bill and set up the bureau.</P>

      <P>I recommend Deputy Mitchell's Bill.  I am looking forward to the response of the Minister of State &mdash; the official line &mdash; to the Bill.  I am sure he will oppose it.  I would like him to outline the grounds on which he will oppose it as it makes a good deal of sense to me.  There are a few matters on this important subject in regard to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  I understand the crime statistics for last year &mdash; which appear to have been leaked &mdash; indicate an overall increase in crime of 8 per cent.  I would have thought that the figure would have been higher.  There has been a fairly dramatic increase in crime in my area of Galway East-Roscommon, an area which for many years was the least crime-ridden.  Last year people who live and work in that area had reason to believe that there had been an increase in crime there.  Like <Col N="1874" /> many members of the public I believe the criminal is winning the war.  If one were to analyse the position it would be hard to pinpoint why this appears to be the case.  The majority of people, particularly the elderly, believe there is an impediment in the way of catching criminals before they commit a crime.  That is a frightful commentary in the light of the very fine people who are involved in crime protection, detection and so on.  I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for their work in this regard.</P>
      <P>I hope the points I raise tonight will be helpful.  I do not agree with the change in approach to policing in rural Ireland. During the years I have been consistent in my views on the policing of rural areas. I do not agree with the principle of grouping Garda Síochána in a nucleus in particular towns from which to police the surrounding countryside and small villages by a squad car.  I believed, and this is borne out by police reviews worldwide, that the presence of the uniformed policeman on the beat is the best deterrent, particularly in respect of petty criminals.  A new principle appears to have been adopted in relation to policing, although it has only being introduced on a pilot basis.  One of the sub-headquarters of such policing activity is in the small town of Mount Bellew from which I come.  The management of the force consider it possible to have a greater police presence in local areas from a squad car than from a garda on the beat, by gardaí communicating with each other through the use of technology, such as of telephones, two-way radios and so.  There must be great pressure on the Garda Commissioner to devise a system whereby sufficient gardaí are deployed in the main areas of crime and at the same time an adequate number of gardaí are deployed to police other areas.  I sound a word of warning to the Minister in regard to inadequate policing of rural areas. However, I support many of the positive measures introduced by the Department of Justice in recent times.  The recruitment of additional gardaí is welcome.</P>

      <P>Many people in areas of the west and in other rural areas believe the policing of those areas is far below what is adequate or recommended. The local policeman or police woman in a small rural community know everybody by name &mdash; they may know too much about them &mdash; and that is the basis of good police work.  There are many no-go areas for the Garda in this and other cities.  It is not possible to build up mutual trust between the Garda and members of a community in a no-go area. The crime situation in rural areas has not deteriorated to that level.  We have the utmost respect for the Garda Síochána. They have earned that respect.  However, I do not like what is happening in regard to policing in rural areas.  If a Garda team are asked to carry out their duty from the position of looking through the windscreen of a patrol car &mdash; no matter how well motivated the team is &mdash; they will never form the bond of friendship and the relationship which is necessary to nip petty criminals in the bud.  Many people would consider the crime rate in rural areas is low and that we have no need to be concerned.  Those who saw the leaked crime statistics will be aware of the position in regard to crime in rural areas.  We are very concerned that the new policing system &mdash; I am not sure if it will be more or less costly than the present system &mdash; is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>The residents of the small town of Moylough can expect the Garda barracks to be open for two out of 24 hours a day. If one needs to transmit a message one must talk to a &ldquo;green man&rdquo; on the door of the Garda station.  As a matter of principle, many people would not visit the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the police force must be utilised to the best possible advantage <Col N="1876" /> and there are management modules in place.  If the Minister takes this measure too far and withdraws the police presence from the small villages of Ireland some future Minister for Justice will have to pay far more in Exchequer funding to tackle the huge rise in crime that will result in these areas.  I compliment the Garda and the local community on the success of the community alert schemes. I hope rural Ireland will get its fair share of the new recruits, when they are trained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central proposal in this short Bill is to create a National Bureau of Crime Statistics having certain statutory functions and powers.  These include a responsibility to measure accurately the levels of crime, to report on those annually, to compare and analyse trends in the levels of crime, to issue interim reports on request to certain office holders, including the Minister for Justice, various members of the Judiciary and chairpersons of Oireachtas committees, to examine and report on the various annual reports published in the Justice area relating to crime, prisons, courts and the probation and welfare service, and on other statistics in relation to crime as they see fit and to ensure that the various annual reports referred to are published promptly and are based on modern and accurate information.</P>
      <P>The Bill envisages that the bureau may compile its own statistics on crime by using sampling methods or other scientific methods.  The bureau would be serviced by the Central Statistics Office, with membership of the bureau drawn from a wide spectrum, representative of all areas of the criminal justice system, and under the chairmanship of the director of the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share some of the concerns reflected in the proposals in the Bill.  I am concerned about various aspects of the official statistics produced in relation to the criminal justice system, but the provisions in Deputy Mitchell's Bill do not come to grips with the fundamental problems in this area.  There are better and <Col N="1877" /> more economic ways of achieving the undoubted improvements that are needed.</P>
    <P>I will describe later on the steps already being taken to reform the present arrangements in this area.  I believe that this can be achieved without establishing a new statutory body, as proposed in the Bill.  I would have certain other reservations about the proposals in the Bill, and their ultimate effectiveness, including some legal and constitutional points. For these reasons I cannot support the proposals in this Bill, despite the sympathy I share with some of its objectives.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House in my speech on the budget last week, recorded indictable crime increased by 1 per cent in 1992 and while final figures for 1993 are not yet available, I am aware that they will show a further increase on the 1992 figure.  However, I am confident that the measures contained in the law and order package which I published last December, and which represents a significant initiative and investment by the Government, will prove effective in dealing with the very broad and complex issue of crime in our society today.  I am sure that all Members are fully aware of the detailed measures contained in the package. I will, therefore, confine myself to breifly mentioning the main measures contained in the package which are as follows: an accelerated recruitment of 407 gardaí in 1994; an annual intake of 350 recruits for the period 1995 to 1997 to maintain the strength of the force at its present level; recruitment of 200 civilian clerical-administrative staff in the period 1994 to 1997 to release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties; implementation of an information technology plan for the gardaí; up-grading of Garda communications network; optimum replacement of Garda fleet; installation of closed circuit television to combat city crime; further development of community-based measures in areas of disadvantage; implementation of certain &mdash; non legal &mdash; proposals of the Government's Advisory Committee on Fraud; providing an additional 210 prison places; recruitment of an additional 50 probation <Col N="1878" /> and welfare officers and support staff in the period 1994 to 1997; the provision of additional probation and welfare facilities and the appointment of three additional judges and support staff.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to section 4 of Deputy Mitchell's Bill which provides that the proposed National Bureau of Crime Statistics will be required to &ldquo;measure accurately the levels of crime&rdquo;. Deputy Mitchell's proposal could imply that crime statistics are not measured accurately at present.  I strongly refute any inference that the Garda suppress reports of crime to make the figures smaller or that I, as Minister for Justice, do not want accurate crime statistics to be published.  I would, therefore, like to firstly explain how crime statistics are recorded.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware the compilation of crime statistics is primarily a matter for the Garda authorities.  I am informed by them that the process of recording a crime commences when a person reports to the Garda Síochána that an offence has been committed or when the Garda witness the crime, or by their own action discover evidence of a crime in the course of a Garda investigation. In addition, a crime may come to light when an offender is being tried or cautioned and asks to have other crimes taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this, first of all, that the recording of crime is much broader than just dealing with crimes which are reported directly to the Garda Síochána by the victim and secondly, that the Garda authorities are the appropriate authority to record crime and report on crime levels because the public must report crime to the Garda Síochána if they wish alleged offences to be investigated. It would, therefore, be unrealistic to separate the functions of recording and reporting of crime from the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that in certain instances a reclassification of crime occurs.</P>
    <P>This is because the Garda Síochána initially makes a brief examination of the facts to determine if there is <i>prima facie</i><Col N="1879" /> evidence of a crime before recording it. Later investigation and decisions of a superintendent of the Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions, or decisions of the courts may result in a reclassification of indictable offences. Generally, the basis of the classification given is the legal definition of the crime and, in particular, the definition of the crime for which a person is, or would be, convicted.</P>
    <P>These points reflect the fact that a specialist knowledge and ongoing information and involvement in the process of criminal investigation is required to classify crimes correctly.  This reinforces the point which I have already made, that the Garda authorities are the most qualified State agency for recording crime and reporting on crime levels.</P>
    <P>While I firmly believed that the Garda Síochána must remain as the primary body with responsibility for recording crime statistics, I would not like to give the impression that I am against any changes in the present system for compiling and presenting statistics on crime, or that I have an inflexible view on the matter.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is always useful to review the way in which we compile the official statistics in this area, not only from the point of view of accuracy, but also to ensure that statistics on crime are processed and presented in such a way as to convey maximum information for the purpose of decision making, policy formation and research.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is in the latter area that our statistics in the criminal justice area are open to most criticism.  As far as accurate measurement of reported crime level is concerned, I do not believe that any independent bureau relying on sampling techniques can improve on the existing methods of data collection, which are based on total enumeration of the subject population in all areas of the criminal justice systems.</P>
    <P>I do not believe statisticians would suggest that sampling may be more accurate than total enumeration.  Sampling techniques inevitably involve error factors <Col N="1880" /> and can produce misleading results.  They cannot hope to convey the total picture. We need to have an objective look at the way in which our statistics in the Justice area are generated, but from the inside rather than from the outside.</P>
    <P>That is not to run the risk that such a review would be inward looking and untimately self-serving.  As Minister for Justice I have a reliable guide to the statistical needs of the public and public representatives through the regular requests for information received in my Department, and through the continuous demands made by Members via the parliamentary question system.</P>
    <P>Such a review can also come to grips with one of the most fundamental problems that needs to be addressed in this area, that is, the improvement in the quality of information that can be derived from a closer integration of the different components of the criminal justice system &mdash; the Garda, the prisons, the courts and the probation and welfare service &mdash; for the purpose of statistic generation. There is a need for greater consistency in recording data and the adoption of a common statistical framework that will produce information in a more meaningful way and so reflect the processing of crime and individuals through the various stages of an interrelated criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>The problem of unrecorded and unreported crime is universal.  I am aware that concern has been expressed in certain quarters that a high level of crime in Ireland is not reported.  As I stated, all crimes reported to the Garda are recorded and crime is also recorded on the basis of other factors, for example, when a member of the Garda Síochána witnesses a criminal act or if the perpetrator subsequently admits to having committed a crime.  However, it is generally accepted that virtually every country and jurisdiction has a certain percentage of unreported crime, and Ireland is no exception.</P>
    <P>Against this background I would, therefore, consider it unfair if people were to suggest that Ireland has a major problem in this regard.  I am sure that <Col N="1881" /> Ireland is no different to most countries in this respect.  Considering the confidence that the general public has in the Garda Síochána it is probable that the percentage of unreported crime is much less here than in many other countries. The problem of unreported crime is a complex one that warrants special study. There are strong psychological and cultural influences involved here.  It is not simply a question of the Garda being somehow negligent or indifferent to a large volume of crime that remains unreported.</P>
    <P>I am sure that a statistical survey designed to measure the incidence of child sexual abuse in Ireland in 1980 would have revealed a very satisfactory situation at the time.  We all know very differently now.  The statistical techniques would not have changed in the meantime.  What has changed dramatically is the reporting culture.  The problem is not necessarily confined to minor crime such as petty larcenies. People who fail to report crime may have good reasons for doing so.  They may be prepared to inform a third party or an anonymous purveyor of a crime perpetrated against them, while remaining opposed to reporting the crime to a member of the Garda Síochána due to the consequences for them or for others of initiating action under the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to a recent Bill passed by the House.  The Statistics Act, 1993, which was passed in July 1993, deals in a very comprehensive way with the whole area of collecting, compiling and reporting of official statistics.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the Act provides for the establishment of the Central Statistics Office as the independent body under the strategic direction of the National Statistics Board with authority not only to compile statistics but also to co-ordinate statistics compiled by other public authorities. The board will also assess the statistical potential of administrative records and make arrangements with other public authorities to collect, compile, extract or disseminate statistics. However, under section 30 (2) of the Act, <Col N="1882" /> the Central Statistics Office will not have a statutory right of access to records pertaining to a court, the Garda Síochána or the prisons administration.  Such records are by their very nature sensitive and it would not be in the public interest to hand over custody of such records to an agency, other than those coming under th direct control of my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that under the Statistics Act, 1993, there is a provision for Government Departments, including my own, to invite the Central Statistics Office to inspect and analyse official statistics along the lines envisaged under Deputy Mitchell's Bill and to put forward suggestions on how they might be improved.  In fact, senior officials of my Department, with representatives of An Garda Síochána, recently met with the Director of the Central Statistics Office to consider how the statistical data coming within my Department's ambit can be more closely co-ordinated and inter-linked.  The Central Statistics Office has particular expertise in this area, and I would be very anxious to avail of its undoubted skills and knowledge.</P>
    <P>Following the recent meeting with the Director of the Central Statistics Office it was decided to set up a special study group to consider how best to co-ordinate the whole area of statistical data and information within my Department.  For this reason I propose to await the findings of the study group to see what recommendations it comes up with.  Indeed should the study group consider it necessary to engage the services of outside consultants to help in this regard I will be happy to consider any such proposals.</P>
    <P>The existing mechanism for the collection and analysis of statistical data is basically very sound and we should be focusing on how to fine tune this.  I am confident the first step in doing this is through the special study group to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's suggestion to establish a national bureau of crime statistics would, I consider, create a number of very fundamental problems.  For example, on a practical level, how could such a bureau be sure of generating statistics <Col N="1883" /> and records similar in quality to those which are retained in local Garda stations?  A national bureau of crime statistics would by its very independence have to be removed from Garda day-to-day operations.  It would be wasteful if it were to operate in parallel to, and duplicate everything already done by, the Garda in this area.  Leaving this aside, such a bureau would be heavily reliant on the Garda for help and for all basic information.  This, in turn, could severely impinge on Garda operational matters and could interfere with the day-to-day work of the force, including publication of the Commissioner's annual crime report.</P>
    <P>There is also a danger that if the bureau was empowered to examine and report on other statistics in relation to crime, as proposed in section 7 (1) (e) of the Bill, from other, presumably unofficial, sources, it would become the target of groups campaigning for legal and political change in relation to particular aspects of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I also have a doubt from a legal point of view about section 4 (b) of the Bill which provides for the issue of reports to certain members of the Judiciary.  Apart from the need for consultation with the Judiciary about the need for, and appropriateness of, such provisions the powers and duties of the Judiciary must be regulated by law, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  I do not believe the provisions in Deputy Mitchell's Bill are adequately drafted to meet the legal requirements in this area.</P>
    <P>I have doubts about the usefulness of setting up an independent body to examine and report on the various annual reports published in the &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; area. Those reports receive wide publicity and analysis in the media at present and are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, where they are frequently debated.  No one appears to be at a disadvantage in co-ordinating or analysing these reports at present, for lack of further independent analysis.</P>
    <P>I am concerned as any bureau would be to ensure prompt publication of these <Col N="1884" /> annual reports.  I am confident that developments already planned in information technology in the Garda Síochána and in other areas of the criminal justice system will go a long way to ensuring that delays are eliminated or greatly minimised in future.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner's annual crime report deals not only with statistics but also includes comment on a range of operational and policy matters.  These are very important in framing the Government's response to crime issues, especially serious crime about which there is justifiable public concern.</P>
    <P>What I particularly have in mind here, for example, is the level of drug abuse and serious offences against the person, including offences of a sexual nature. This is a task for the Garda Commissioner and could not be undertaken by a bureau, as suggested in Deputy Mitchell's Bill.  It is important to bear in mind that crime statistics are only a snap-shot of the position of crime in the community: the Garda Commissioner's annual crime report looks at the issue from an organisational viewpoint and is best placed to consider changes to improve the operation as a whole.</P>
    <P>While the primary source for crime statistics is the Garda Síochána, other areas of the criminal justice system, such as the courts and the prisons, would have input in this area.  Both of these areas compile statistics primarily for their own specific management needs.  In relation to the courts in particular, statistics are currently related to the operational needs of the courts system.  A major computerisation of the courts system is at present being undertaken and when finalised will facilitate the production of a much more detailed breakdown of statistical information.</P>
    <P>In relation to statistics on prisons and places of detention, an annual report on prisons and places of detention has to be produced by law for each year.  As well as containing an outline of the main developments which occurred in the prisons during the year and the reports of the visiting committees to the prisons, <Col N="1885" /> an important part of the reports is the extensive statistical information they contain.</P>
    <P>The statistical tables in the annual reports are broken down into three sections.  The first section deals with statistics for the year in question; the second section covers trends over the previous five years and the last section examines in detail the population in prison on the first day of the year.</P>
    <P>These statistics are compiled centrally in my Department from information gathered from local prison records.  They are compiled manually, except in the case of Mountjoy Prison where a computerised prisoner records system is in operation.  When I was appointed Minister for Justice, I was concerned that there was a lot of criticism of the fact that no annual report had been published since the 1988 report.  This backlog was caused by staff pressure in the prisons division of the Department.  However, I took immediate steps to correct this situation and I was glad to be able to present to Government last December the annual reports for 1989, 1990 and 1991.  Work on the 1992 report is at an advanced stage and will be published shortly and I intend to produce the 1993 report as soon as possible after that.</P>
    <P>I know that questions arise now and again about the adequacy and relevance of the statistics provided in the annual reports and about their value as an aid to policy making in the prison system. Nevertheless, they have proved a rich source of information for numerous independent sociological studies.  The presentation of the statistics has also been criticised, especially the format which has not changed for a number of years.  I am inclined to agree that improvements are desirable but can understand that the pressure to clear the backlog of annual reports has not allowed time for a critical reassessment of both the method of compilation and presentation.  At the same time, there is the fact that the consistency of the format has its benefits for researchers in facilitating comparison and observation of trends.</P>
    <P>There is scope for improvement and <Col N="1886" /> the proposed study group will give us the opportunity to examine the whole method of compilation and presentation of statistics in relation to all aspects of the criminal justice system.  While it would be beneficial to keep much of the consistency which I mentioned, the group could consider what other information would be useful to include and what other improvements could be made.  For instance, one area I feel would be worth exploring would be better co-ordination of the Garda Síochána crime reports with the prisons reports in order to establish the correlations, for example, in the numbers of convictions against committals to prison.  This study group provides the ideal opportunity for detailed examination of deficiencies and how they might be corrected.</P>

      <P>It would be unfortunate if the word went out that this Minister was refusing to accept this particular Bill simply because it was a Bill produced by the Fine Gael Party.  The record is that I have accepted a Bill from somebody who I acknowledge may be on the other side of the Deputy's party and I hope to be in a position during my tenure of office as Minister for Justice to accept a number of other Bills.  As Minister for Justice I would much prefer to have a members of the Garda out on our streets fighting crime, as Deputy Connaughton proposed, than in offices compiling statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Connaughton's remarks concerning rural policing, it is important to place on record that the Garda Commissioner, his deputy and assistant commissioners and chief super-intendents in each division are ultimately responsible for the day to day operational matters within the Garda Síochána.  From time to time it is necessary for them to <Col N="1887" /> constructively look at the way they deliver a service to the community and they have been doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne and I would be well aware of areas in our own constitutencies where the policing methods have been changing over the past two years in particular and where a community policing programme has been put into place.  It has been represented to me in the past 12 months or so that in certain areas, community policing has worked very well and people on the ground are pleased with it but in other areas has not been such a success.  There will always be teething problems with these things.  If something is working well people might say that it should be changed or refined in a particular way.  People who have been used to doing business in a certain way will always say the new system is not working as well as the old.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton that the best deterrent for criminals is to see a man or woman in uniform walking the streets, whether it is in rural or urban Ireland.  At the same time, it is fair to expect the Commissioner and his senior management to look at all areas of policing, both in rural and urban Ireland, and make suggestions for change, get the agreement of the unions to put this in place, see how it works and evaluate it continuously.  That is a fair point and it is something we should be prepared to allow to continue.  If it is not working they will then have to find another way of doing it but I would not like, as Minister for Justice, to dictate to the Commissioner or his senior management how operational matters should be carried out and in fairness to Deputy Mitchell, I do not think he would be asking that that should be done.</P>
    <P>In certain areas of rural Ireland the public have an antipathy to talking to the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; as it is now commonly known.  People in rural Ireland want a police presence in their areas.  That is what the community policing system is attempting to put in place.  It is necessary from time to time for the Garda Commissioner to consider the way business is <Col N="1888" /> carried out in urban Ireland because more and more in city areas &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Mitchell as Justice spokesman finds this also &mdash; communities where crime is increasing are constantly asking for a Garda station, a substation or a clinic, as some of them are called now, to be opened.  The Garda Commissioner has felt that should be resisted &mdash; and I support him &mdash; because every time we open a Garda station, men and women are taken off the streets and put behind desks.  The whole philosophy of all of us, Opposition and Government, over the past number of years has been to civilianise the Garda Síochána, to take people who have been trained at great expense to the taxpayers away from clerical and administrative duties and put them on our streets.</P>
    <P>On a regular basis we try to find better ways of doing our business.  Of course I can examine proposals Deputy Mitchell made this evening or that other members of his party may make over the next two weeks, but, at the end of the day, I would prefer to have gardaí on the streets fighting crime than behind desks compiling statistics.  I am confident that the way I proposed is the way to proceed with reform in this area rather than along the lines proposed in Deputy Mitchell's Bill.</P>
    <P>For that reason I invite Deputy Mitchell to withdraw his Bill.  If he is unwilling to do so &mdash; and I suspect he may well be &mdash; on behalf of the Government I formally oppose the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá brón orm a chloisint go bhfuil an tAire i gcoinne an Bhille íontach seo.  Tá figiúirí againn ón Central Statistics Office do gach gné beagnach den saol seo.  Baineann cuid de na figiúirí seo le rudaí macánta, an daonra, mar shampla.  Tugann siad eolas dúinn ar cad tá riachtanach don saol.  Tá figiúirí ag an Aire Oideachais a thugann le fhios dó nó dí cad tá ag teastáil ó thaobh líon na múinteoirí de nó ó thaobh uimhir na seomraí atá ag teastáil. Sa tslí céanna bíonn a fhios ag an Aire Sláinte cé mhéid leapacha atá ag teastáil do na seandaoine.  Beidh sé ullamh nuair a bheidh mise im' sheanduine le cúnamh <Col N="1889" /> Dé agus beidh go leor leapacha le fáil do na daoine sin ó na figiúirí go léir atá sa Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>Tá na figiúirí atá ag na Garda ceart go leor ach tugann an Bille seo comhairle freisin.  Tá daoine a bhfuil eolas acu seachas na Garda agus ba chóir go mbeadh an comhairle sin ar fáil don Aire agus go mbeadh sí mar chabhair dí.</P>
      <P>The long Title of this Bill reads:</P>
      <P>An Act to create a National Bureau of Crime Statistics whose terms of reference shall be to measure accurately the levels of crime and report on these annually by the 31st March and to compare increases or decreases from period to period with analyses as to the actual levels of crime, together with any comments they feel are helpful in dealing with the crime problem.</P>
      <P>The final part of that title which says &ldquo;together with any comments they feel are helpful in dealing with the crime problem&rdquo; should be a major help to any Minister rather than merely being furnished with bare statistics by the Garda. Particularly when this National Bureau of Crime Statistics is to be comprised of the Director of the Central Statistics Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Accounting Officer of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, an assistant Garda commissioner, a prison governor, a judge of the High Court and a representative of the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice, nominated by the Minister for Justice, surely that group dealing with statistics compiled mainly by the Garda and others could offer the Minister much advice in dealing with the figures presented to them.  For example, there could be compiled a list of crimes, giving the bare facts, demonstrating that some particular crime had been committed, say, 999 times whereas if an analysis is undertaken by experts used to breaking down these types of statistics, one can more readily decide on what action is necessary.  That is why I say the establishment of this bureau would be of help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said she has initiated a <Col N="1890" /> study group.  Knowing her it would be fair to say that that is not just a cover up because she does tend to deal with problems in her Department.  I am sure that study group will present her with figures and suggestions but I hope they will not cut across her reservations as to why the provisions of this Bill would not be operable or effective.  I hope the Minister will not have to swallow what she had to say in the latter part of her contribution, with which I will deal later if time permits.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report, quoted so often in the past, concluded that the lack of information on crime was not merely a nuisance which hindered research but was a feature of the criminal justice system in that decisions are taken at one stage in ignorance of what is occurring elsewhere.  The normal statistics provided by the Garda &mdash; and sometimes they are questioned as to whether they provide the full report of crime &mdash; do not convey the sort of story that would be conveyed by an analysis and/or comparison undertaken by people capable of doing so.  In addition, the Law Reform Commission report said that any provisional recommendations in their paper or recommendations ultimately made in their report would be rendered comparatively ineffective by the absence of proper information.</P>
    <P>I accept that the study group will probably make suggestions but, clearly, Deputy Mitchell was ahead of his time endeavouring to implement the suggestions contained in the Whitaker report and that of the Law Reform Commission, in devising a system under which crime statistics would be available and properly analysed.</P>
    <P>Next, I believe that court sentences and the manner in which some judges behave warrant a comparative study also; this would be a help to judges themselves. I would not like to see a uniform system of sentencing prevail because very often some judges fine a poor, unemployed person the same amount as someone who is better off.  That is not a case of the punishment fitting the crime in that a £10 fine on an unemployment person might <Col N="1891" /> be a very severe punishment whereas a £100 fine on reasonasbly well off person might not cause him or her any great hassle.  Nonetheless there could be a study undertaken of sentences and fines, in addition to the order or request, whichever it be, for a convicted person to put so much money into the poor box.  I have often wondered whether being asked to put money in the poor box was a fitting sentence for anybody.  The imposition of a fine ensures that justice is seen to be done but a request to put, say, £100, £200 or £300 into a court poor box by the next election strikes me as being reminiscent of the type of indulgence one gained years ago when, if one recited certain prayers, one was relieved of a certain amount of punishment in the next world.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Perhaps the Minister of State will brief me on it later.  It sounds as though paying a few pounds to charity &mdash; while, admittedly, I suppose it can be regarded as a fine &mdash; from a legal point of view does nothing for law and justice in that it appears that, by so doing one can be absolved of the relevant crime.  A person is either guilty or not guilty and, if found guilty, should be subject to legal sentence. That is another matter with which this proposed bureau would be able to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that comparative studies be undertaken, that justice be seen to be done, that one endeavours to analyse what has been done so that cothrom na féinne is afforded to everybody. This would mean that we avoid the whole concept of black and white when a judge has no leeway.  Indeed, decisions on fines are difficult for judges in that they hear so much evidence, see so many <Col N="1892" /> people, and learn their circumstances it might be no harm if they, too, had help.</P>
    <P>We must take a very serious look at what is happening about the overall drugs problem not alone in our courts but throughout society.  There was a time when the drugs scene appeared to be concentrated in Dublin only.  It has now become a major criminal activity in Dublin, with people making vast sums of money from their dealings in drugs. Unfortunately, our smaller towns are now discovering that there are budding criminals there endeavouring to make a soft living at the expense of young people.  It is vital that we have a breakdown of the number of drug convictions. The lives of many young people are destroyed by drug dealers.  I would not quibble with the severity of any sentence given to a drug dealer.  No sentence is severe enough for those who destroy so many young lives in order to make money.</P>
    <P>When one considers the value and number of drugs that were found in the sea off Cork one realises the kind of money involved.  Drug dealers have no interest in the welfare of this country or the people they are destroying.  We need to know how the drug scene is growing. Judges should be given the right to sentence drug dealers to life imprisonment. They amass wealth and live the easy life while other lives are wrecked.  Parents need backup in the fight against drugs. They send their children to college at great personal expense.  They cannot be with their children at all times and sometimes young people under pressure at college resort to drug taking as an easy way out.</P>
    <P>The quality of life in Ireland is getting worse.  There is no urban-rural divide when it comes to crime.  Criminals often set out from Dublin to rural areas in stolen cars and frighten elderly people living alone.  I compliment the gardaí for the way they have dealt with such criminals. It is awful that people who have served the country so well cannot live in peace and comfort in their homes.  We cannot have enough squad cars to chase these criminals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> When canvassing we find that doors are locked very early in the evening.  Old people are afraid to open the door.  We must look at why this is happening.  If we had a study and breakdown of crime statistics we might be able to prevent such crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton spoke about rural gardaí and squad cars.  He said everything that should be said about that. The gardaí have a difficult job.  If we report a crime to them we want the squad car to be with us within two minutes but in providing such a service we are left with insufficient gardaí on the streets.  I, like the Minister and others, believe that the presence of a garda on the street lets us know that there is such a thing as proper behaviour.  In the years I have been driving from Carlow to Dublin I have never seen a garda in any of the built up areas.  Perhaps that is because I travel early in the morning and late at night; it may be just as well if I do not see them sometimes as I can forget I am driving in a 30 mile area.</P>
    <P>In the past everybody knew the garda on the beat and the garda in turn knew everybody.  Nowadays he does not have time to patrol the streets.  What we need are more gardaí; I know they are being recruited.  When gardaí are in squad cars they are not in touch with the people.  It is very difficult to steal up on someone if you are in a squad car.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the green man.  On one occasion the Browne man found a purse at the Rock of Dunamase, a lovely place &mdash; I invite the Minister to picnic there.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I went to the nearest Garda station.  There was a notice there about the green man and the Browne man spoke, like a fool, to a gadget.  That kind of policing where a Garda station is open for two hours a day is not working.  The Minister said it works in some places but I believe we must have a Garda presence in the station to know what is going on.  If the bureau were set up it could analyse all these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> The Garda Commissioner is an expert in his own field but sometimes when we are very involved in a specific area, we are blinded to what needs to be done. Perhaps the commissioner needs advice from somebody else.  Is the gadget on the wall a suitable replacement for a Garda station with gardaí present?</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the role of the community alert scheme.  It is marvellous to see people with that kind of community spirit.  In the past religion played a greater role in everyone's life than it does at present.  Perhaps the liberal agenda is helping to do away with standards. In the past, the gardaí were treated with respect; today they have difficulty dealing with young people in our cities and towns.  It is terrible to see shop windows barricaded.  There was a time when people could window shop but now windows are covered with steel grids.  Perhaps the special task force, which was disbanded for economic reasons, could rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will receive the publicity it deserves and that the task force the Minister mentioned will be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  It has a long history.  During the 12 years I have been in politics this issue has been just below the surface.  The Coolock Community Law Centre has been treated outrageously in the past.  The Government has never provided regular or reliable <Col N="1895" /> funding for it.  It has been tossed like a hot potato from one Department to another.  One could always observe that Ministers praised it to the high heavens, referring to the quality of the work being done and how it would act as a marvellous model for the rest of the country.  The only common feature was that when it came to committing money to the centre to allow it to develop its services and continue in operation, the money was always lacking.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the centre was transferred from the Department of Justice, to the Department of Social Welfare, from there to the Combat Poverty Agency and finally to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  At no stage has it received a commitment to solid reliable funding so that it could develop its services in the future and give a commitment to its many thousands of clients that they would know from year to year that they could return to the centre and rely on the service being available.  It is the piggy in the middle when it comes to Ministers tossing money around.  It is not acceptable that this should continue again in 1994, 12 years after this problem was first brought to ministerial attention. Every year that I can recall, funding to this centre was on the basis of giving it a half tank of petrol to run for a full year. Of course it began to chug around July, August and September and it would be scrounging and scraping to continue in operation to the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In recent years the centre has had to seriously curtail its services.  Last year it had to close its offices to new clients for long periods.  It has had to curtail its family law service to dealing only with emergency cases and it has had to curtail its catchment area.  This is from a centre that on everybody's admission had been extremely cost effective and even more effective in terms of cost than the official legal aid board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that the Government had committed itself to a charter to deal and co-operate with voluntary agencies.  It is ironic that as soon as the ink is dry on the charter, the legal aid <Col N="1896" /> boards are getting a commitment of very substantial sums in increased funding while the Coolock Community Law Centre is told it will not receive reliable funding.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that today the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare has faxed to the centre her decision that they will continue to receive funding from the Combat Poverty Agency on the basis of last year's funding. That is progress, because the centre was due to close at the end of the month and was preparing to issue notices to all is clients that that would be the case.  Let us be honest, that is again a hand to mouth situation.  The Minister is aware that £148,000 is required to run the centre, but this year she is providing only £100,000.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked whether the Minister for Equality and Law Reform after he met those in the centre in November last year, sought to have such funding included in his Estimates? He indicated during the Estimates debate last year that he saw the logic of his funding this centre, that there should be one source of funding for the Coolock Community Law Centre and for FLAC. Did he seek that funding?  Was he refused funding from his Government colleagues? How deep is the commitment to equality and law reform if a centre like the Coolock Community Law Centre has to curtail its services at a time when people are queuing for three hours at the door for the emergency service provided once a week?  It has had to turn people away at the end of the night, all because of a lack of serious commitment to funding.</P>

      <P>I and my Department fully support the valuable work of Coolock Community Law Centre in providing a communty-based legal advice and information service in the Coolock area.  There is no question and there never was any question of funding to the centre being withdrawn or discontinued. The centre received £100,000 in funding from the Combat Poverty Agency in 1993 and will receive the same level of funding in 1994.</P>
      <P>I might mention that the centre has, in fact, been funded on a continuous basis by the Combat Povety Agency since 1986.  The centre undertakes a wide range of work, including legal work and advice and provision of advice and information on a whole range of entitlements, including social welfare matters.  In relation to the legal side, the question arises as to how the centre relates to the civil legal aid scheme.  With the setting up of the new Department of Equality and Law Reform and the increased attention by this Department to that scheme, I have been looking at where the Coolock Community Law Centre fits in the overall picture.  The centre is somewhat unique in that its work spans the areas of legal advice and social services/social welfare information and advice and in that it receives almost 100 per cent funding from my Department.</P>
      <P>What we need to examine is whether the centre should be funded by the Combat Poverty Agency as heretofore or whether it is more appropriate that it should be funded as part of an expanded and integrated civil legal aid service.  My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, has secured additional funding of £1.8 million in 1994 for the civil legal aid service, bringing the total allocation to £5 million.  This will allow a considerable expansion in the scheme in 1994 and future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of where Coolock Community Law Centre can best fit in within the context of all these developments is being examined at present but is one that <Col N="1898" /> will take some time to resolve.  Among the issues being examined are whether a joint funding arrangement might be appropriate, given that in addition to its core legal advice service, the centre provides a social welfare information and advice service.</P>
    <P>I see an important role for the centre as part of and working alongside an expanded statutory legal aid service and that it would bring a valuable community-based perspective to bear on that service. In the meantime and pending resolution of the long-term funding issue, I have made arrangements to ensure that the centre continues to be funded by the Combat Poverty Agency at the same level as last year, £100,000.  I might make the point that this figure itself represented a sizeable advance on the annual funding of £70,000 made available to the centre by the agency in the period 1990 to 1992.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your giving me the opportunity to raise this issue, which I know is of particular interest to yourself, Sir, and, indeed, to all public representatives in County Tipperary.  It is with a deep sense of frustration and annoyance that I again raise the issue of the administration of the Leader programme by Tipperary Enterprise Board. I will not repeat the history of this debacle.  It is well recorded and documented. The last time I raised this issue in Dáil Éireann I had some harsh things to say about Tipperary Enterprise and their incompetence and negligence.  It has been a shameful episode inflicting considerable <Col N="1899" /> grief and distress on many people.  Ultimately, the responsibility for this fiasco rests with the Minister and the Department.  They have been passing the buck and side-stepping the issue.  The Commission in Brussels are conveniently used as pawns to deflect attention from the Department and are used regularly as an excuse for inaction.</P>
      <P>The Minister has confirmed that the Garda were instructed to commence an investigation into suspected fraud.  Did this investigation commence, has it concluded, what are the findings?  If it did not commence, why not?  Who stopped the investigation?</P>
      <P>I also received a commitment that the Department would take full responsibility for resolving all outstanding claims by applicants.  I was assured that this matter would be conducted expediently and sympathetically.  Twelve months later the trial of broken promises and misery is stronger than ever.  There are still numerous companies awaiting payment. The promoters of these projects have had their aspirations and ambitions dashed by State bureaucracy and bungling of an unprecedented nature.  Their personal lives have been cruelly damaged, their very future and that of their dependent families has been jeopardised. They are the innocent victims of this tragic avoidable disaster.  They are highly critical of the Department.  They justifiably claim that they have been ignored, fobbed-off and in some cases dismissed as cranks because they continued to pursue their legitimate entitlements under the Leader scheme.</P>
      <P>I have heard and read appalling stories arising from this totally unacceptable situation. The following are extracts from some of many letters I have received, outlining harrowing stories:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Department of Agriculture was truly and honestly concerned about the treatment we got from Tipperary Enterprise, they could have acted 12 months ago.  By not acting at all they have worsened our situation to an extent that we are close to ruin.  Our <Col N="1900" /> production plant is working for one day per week.</P>
    <P>My personal interpretation is that the Department had no interest in bringing light into the whole story, they were not sincere in their announcement to help the victims of Tipperary Enterprise.  Their strategy obviously was to wear people out so that they are in the end happy with any money at all coming from the Department.</P>
    <P>Had the Department acted in time they not only had avoided the worsening of our financial and economic situation, they also would have avoided huge claims for compensation which will now come before the High Court.</P>
    <P>One letter concludes:</P>
    <P>And this is only the economic situation of our Company, not to mention the effects this all had on our personal situations.  My wife developed a heart rhythm problem, depression has moved in where once was a whole bunch of energy.  This nightmare has changed our personalities.</P>
    <P>Another letter reads:</P>
    <P>I was promised £25,000 in February, 1992 for my knitwear project.  I raised and spent £42,000.  They reneged on the grant.  I got no money.  I have three quarters of a knitwear collection which may never be finished.  I have run out of money completely.  My life is shattered. I am now unemployed.</P>

    <P>I sought £35,000 for my project.  I received verbal assurances that this project had been approved and would be funded.  I was told the project fitted all the criteria, and that other Leader groups had sanctioned similar projects. The money never came.  Michael, I was forced to sell stock and then my milk quota.  The interest charge has crippled me.  I will never recover.</P>
    <P>That is an example from the catalogue of cases I could cite.</P>
    <P>Does the Department intend paying outstanding money and when will the <Col N="1901" /> rightful entitlement be paid to those unfortunate applicants?  Where has the money gone which was supposed to be given out as grant aid and who were the beneficiaries?  Who benefited from the fact that £500,000 of taxpayers' money seems to have gone missing?  How much did the liquidator of assets realise, and who was the legal owner of the Tipperary Trading Company premises at Bird Hill? Was this building available to the liquidator as a saleable asset?  How much money did the liquidator have at his disposal from the sale of assets?  How was the money disbursed?  What is owed to the creditors and has the money lost to the Department been recouped from the insurance fund?  If not, will the Minister give a categorical assurance that the money is redeemable through the insurance company?  Will he belately acknowledge that his Department exercised insufficient supervision and control and that it must ultimately take the responsibility?  Will the Minister once again give an assurance that the promises made by agents acting on behalf of the Department will be honoured?  Will he ensure that justice is done and bring this appalling saga to a satisfactory conclusion?</P>

      <P>As the House is already aware, the agreement between my Department and Tipperary Enterprise was terminated on 18 February 1993 following my Department's investigation of the mismanagement of the affairs of the group. I made a very detailed statement to this House on the matter on 11 February last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consultations with the European Commission, it was agreed that my Department would take on the administration of the programme in Tipperary in so far as it related to honouring commitments made to project promoters by Tipperary Enterprise.  Having regard to the rules of the Leader programme, we <Col N="1902" /> and the Commission agreed to honour such commitments on the following basis.</P>
    <P>First, projects must be eligible for Leader funding and there must have been a clear commitment by the board of the company to the project.  For this purpose we accepted either a written contract between Tipperary Enterprise and the promoter, a record in the minutes of a board meeting of a decision to grant aid the project or any other convincing written evidence indicating a commitment by the company to grant aid a project. Alleged verbal promises of aid cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>Claims for payment of grant aid would be entertained only in the case of projects which were completed or where work had actually commenced.  Where work had not commenced the commitment was deemed to have lapsed and the promoter was advised to submit a new application for grant aid to the new Tipperary Leader Group.</P>
    <P>Payments in settlement would only be made on the basis of submission of a fully documented claim showing that the work involved had been completed, that documentary evidence of payments to builders and suppliers existed by, for example, production of paid invoices, that where necessary the planning laws had been complied with, and that the beneficiaries' tax affairs were in order etc.  This is the normal procedure followed by Leader groups in committing funds to projects and processing the resultant claims once the project have been completed.</P>
    <P>This is the only practical and equitable approach which the European Commission and my Department could take to resolving the difficult situation which arose.  My Department is obliged at all times to act responsibly and prudently in the administration of public funds and to verify that expenditure from public funds is justified.</P>
    <P>Following our investigation of the company's records we wrote in April 1993 to those project promoters whom we identified as having made applications for aid to the company.  In those cases where the records showed that a commitment of aid <Col N="1903" /> clearly existed we invited the promoters to submit a claim on the lines I indicated on completion of the project.  If the project had not in fact commenced then the promoters were advised that the commitment had lapsed and that he or she should apply instead for aid to the new Tipperary Leader group.</P>
    <P>Where no evidence could be found in the company's records of a commitment to aid a project, we invited the promoters to submit any evidence that he or she might have.  There was also, at that time, one case in which legal proceedings had been instituted against the Minister.</P>
    <P>To date my Department has paid £186,000 to nine project promoters.  A further four claims are being processed and I expect that it will be possible to finalise payments in these cases in the near future.  To a large extent my Department is dependent on the promoters concerned submitting the necessary documentation to enable the claim to be finalised.  I should add there are a further six cases where the promoters have not, to date, submitted fully documented claims.</P>
    <P>A small number of the cases I mentioned are particularly complicated.  We are in regular discussion with the European Commission on these with a view to reaching a satisfactory resolution.</P>
    <P>My Department has acted sympathetically and as helpfully as possible towards the promoters involved, within the constraints placed upon us.  Where promoters submitted all the necessary documentation we have made payment as quickly as possible.  Where it has not been possible for my Department to establish that a commitment was made to a promoter, either through our own examination of the company's records or where the promoter has been unable to establish such a commitment himself, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department has no authority to disburse public funds.  Where this is the case we have encouraged the promoters to submit applications to the New Tipperary group.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to reassure Deputy Lowry that sufficient funds exist <Col N="1904" /> to meet all valid claims that may be made to us.</P>

      <P>I very much welcome the opportunity to raise this issue which is a matter of great concern in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>Let me take this opportunity also to congratulate you, Sir, on the political acumen you have shown today, particularly in the choice of matters on the adjournment from the Fine Gael Party. Obviously, Sir, you are one who builds on the positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a subvention scheme was introduced with the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act everybody was delighted that at long last hardpressed families would be given assistance to meet the extremely high charges of nursing homes.  This was a widely welcomed measure but the nursing homes increased their charges inordinately.  I am only aware of the situation in the Cork area and am not certain of what happened right across the country, but I am extremely concerned about it.  I am aware that at least five nursing homes in the Cork area have increased their fees on the basis of complying with the regulations in the Nursing Homes Act.  I am aware of families who pool their resources to ensure that a family member can be maintained in a nursing home.  In one instance, only one member of the family is employed, four others are unemployed and they have to pay £130 a week to the nursing home.  However, as soon as a subvention of £50 per week was made available to them, there was an increase of £35 per week.  I had a phone call from a distraught woman whose mother is in a nursing home.  The woman <Col N="1905" /> is ill and cannot possibly look after her mother but as soon as she received her subvention of £60 per week, the nursing home increased its fee from £130 to £200 per week and any benefits she would derive from the subvention were lost.  In another case, a pensioner who took early retirement applied for a subvention for his mother-in-law and on being awarded a subvention of £70 was notified that the nursing home charge was increased by £50.  This is causing great misery and putting severe financial strain on the families involved.</P>
    <P>The average subvention is approximately £70 per week.  Is there any point in the Government providing a subvention when the operators of private nursing homes increase their charges and there is no net benefit to the families experiencing financial difficulties?  Why is this the case?  Indeed, I asked the health board the same question.  The justification private nursing homes give for these increases is compliance with fire regulations.  I cannot comprehend why compliance with the fire regulations would impose such a cost factor.  Planning permission is needed for a nursing home, the permission is subject to the fire safety officer approving the safety precautions installed and, therefore, should have been part and parcel of the planning permission in the first instance.  Privately, families are telling me that the increase is a total rip off and I have had no justification from operators as to why the fees should be increased.  The families have no way out except to come to somebody like me to air their grievances in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell me he has no jurisdiction in this matter.  Is it not very serious that the Government provides a subvention which is being eaten up by private operators who, unscrupulously, increase their charges inordinately?  It is possible for the Minister to ensure a common price structure for nursing home care as what is happening at present is totally unfair?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the <Col N="1906" /> Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 is, first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act and, secondly, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has no responsibility to control or regulate the fees charged by nursing homes.  Nursing homes are private or voluntary enterprises which have been established by individual or philanthropic initiative. While the Nursing Homes Act gives new powers to health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes, it respects in full the private or voluntary ownership and management of nursing homes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reported increase in nursing fees in the Cork area, I have been advised that some increases have taken place in nursing home charges.  I have also been advised that these are homes which previously charged fees which were below the average cost of care for nursing homes in the region. Prior to the introduction of the new subvention scheme the fees of some nursing homes were often limited to what people could afford to pay and it was widely represented that many nursing homes were operating at an uneconomic rate as a result.  The main objective of the Nursing Homes Act is to ensure high standards of care in nursing homes and many homes have been obliged to carry our improvements to meet the new standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new subvention scheme was introduced with the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act to help people pay for the costs of care in a nursing home. The maximum subvention rates payable under the new scheme are £70, £95 or £120 per week depending on the level of dependency of the person applying for subvention.  This represents a substantial contribution towards the costs of care in a nursing home and is a major improvement on the situation which existed prior <Col N="1907" /> to the implemention of the Nursing Homes Act when most persons in nursing homes were receiving no subvention.  If a person feels that the amount of subvention approved is inadequate the person can appeal the decision on subvention to the health board.  Such appeals will be carefully considered by the health board especially where a family is unable to pay the extra costs of care due to recent increases in nursing home fees.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am glad Deputy O'Keeffe has brought this matter to our <Col N="1908" /> attention.  I am aware of his interest in the matter and that he has made repeated representations to the Department in this regard.  It struck me, listening to him, that, in the event of increases, patients may be paid a higher subvention rate.  If he wants to draw my attention to individual cases I will undertake to contact the chief executive officer of the health board in each case.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 5 of the terms and conditions of the January-February 1993 special beef premium scheme, which accompanied every application form issued to farmers, made it very clear that applicants who were not the subject of an on-farm inspection should forward their cattle identity cards to the local office of my Department for scrutiny, punching and stamping before selling any cattle which had been submitted for premium.</P>
      <P>The person named sold the cattle he had applied on through a mart some seven months after application but did not forward the cards for punching to Galway local office as required.  One purpose of the requirement is to ensure that any purchaser would be fully aware of the premium status of the animals he buys.  In this case another farmer could have bought the cattle involved with unpunched ears and clean, unpunched cattle identity cards and could have presented them for premium in good faith in a later application period.  I believe that any such purchaser would be entitled to feel aggrieved if refused payment on the animals in question because payment had been made to the first applicant.  It is, therefore, not possible to make payment to the person named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that in certain situations where cards were not presented to the local offices of my Department for punching, my Department has been able to show considerable flexibility.  For example, where animals were slaughtered and this could be proven, payment <Col N="1703" /> of January-February 1993 special beef premium has been made; where animals were exported to destinations outside the European Union and this can be proven, my Department, under a concession which I announced recently, will pay special beef premium.  The cases of flexibility I have just mentioned assume of course that the animals are eligible in all other ways.</P>

The relative upsurge in infection which occurred in 1992 and early in 1993 did not affect Ireland's officially Brucellosis Free trading status.

      <P>Under the TB and Brucellosis Eradication Schemes a comprehensive scheme of reactor grants is in operation based on animal type and weight.  In addition, herdowners may also be paid income supplement or depopulation grants as appropriate.  Also a reactor collection service is provided free of charge to herdowners for the removal of their reactor animals.</P>
      <P>The grant payment supplements the slaughter value of reactors paid to the herdowner by the meat plants.  Generally speaking, the grants are designed to bridge the difference between the slaughter price and the cost of an equivalent replacement animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be appreciated that there is a limit on the amount of funds available for grants under the TB and Brucellosis Eradication Schemes to which herdowners themselves contribute substantially by way of payment of bovine <Col N="1706" /> diseases levy on each gallon of milk processed and each animal slaughtered or exported live.</P>
    <P>In normal course, reactor grant rates are reviewed on an on-going basis in line with market trends and taking account of a variety of factors including prices being paid by meat plants for reactor animals. At present good prices are being obtained by herdowners for reactor animals.</P>

      <P>The returns to Irish milk producers depend ultimately on the market returns from the product into which their milk is transformed, the share of that return retained by processors, and the extent to which they choose to reply on market supports.  The effect on Irish milk prices of the Commission proposal, if approved by the Council of Ministers, would therefore depend on the response of Irish processors to the new situation.</P>

      <P>Cattle prices have remained remarkably buoyant over the past twelve months.  Prices had been expected to fall as a consequence of the 5 per cent intervention price reduction last July.  The increased premiums were designed to compensate for such a price fall.  However, cattle prices did not fall and for most of 1993 were running considerably higher than the previous year. In fact, in January 1994 prices were about 12 per cent higher than in January 1993. While prices have weakened somewhat this month, it would be difficult to attribute that solely to any one of the many factors that can influence price trends. The effect of export refunds, including pre-fixed refunds, on the price of cattle in a particular period depends on, among other things, the proportion of the kill designed, during that period, for markets to which refunds apply.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 65 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>I announced on 27 January that the Government had formally approved an Agri-Environment Programme for Ireland, to be known as the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS).  On the same day it was also announced that in Brussels the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development had agreed to our proposals under the programme.  It is expected that expenditure under REPS will amount to £230 million up to 1997 with further expenditure after that and that some 40,000 farmers will avail of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be implemented when formal approval of the European Commission has been obtained.  This will take approximately two months leading to the implementation of the scheme in April. Detailed guidelines and application forms will be available at that stage.</P>
      <P>As the detailed submission made by my Department to the European Commission is confidential I am not in a position to make it available to Deputies.  The general details of the draft scheme will be circulated with the official report.  The extra premium for (i) organic farming will be up to 150 ECU (£146) per hectare for land in conversion and 75 ECU (£73) per hectare thereafter and (ii) for rare breeds 100 ECU (£98) per livestock unit.</P>
      <P>The conditions for the scheme, including the question of existing legal obligations on farmers such as rights of access and rights of way, are being examined by my officials at present.</P>

      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government undertook to review all national policies relating to the agriculture and food sector and negotiate with the organisations a new Development Programme for the sector.  In furtherance of this commitment, a working group, consisting of representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and of the farm organisations was established.  This Working Group produced a draft report in December 1993, which included a number of suggestions in relation to land policy.  In particular, it suggested measures to increase structural change, to be achieved through the operation of the new farmer retirement scheme and changes in the capital acquisitions taxation code and in stamp duty.  A number of these suggestions have been accepted by Government in the context of the new Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>

      <P>The EU market for pigmeat has been experiencing difficulties for some time now due to over-production in the Union as a whole which is currently around 105 per cent self-sufficient in pigmeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU pigmeat is subject to a common <Col N="1713" /> organisation of the market, and so the responsibility for market management and for any special measures rests with the EU.  It is not legally possible to take national measures without EU agreement.</P>
    <P>I have raised the difficulties being experienced by Irish pig producers and requested appropriate action at the Council of Ministers on a number of occasions.  My Department has also raised these matters with the Commission. Moreover at a special meeting which I sought with Commissioner Steichen last month I requested him to take additional measures to alleviate the difficulties in the pigmeat sector.</P>
    <P>In response to requests from Ireland and other member states the Commission have taken a series of market support measures.  In March 1993 an Aids to Private Storage Scheme was introduced which temporarily removed about 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the market.  In May and September special export refunds were introduced for exports of pigmeat to Eastern Europe which accounted for a total of 60,000 tonnes of pigmeat being removed from the market.  In addition, the EU responded to outbreaks of Classical Swine Fever in Germany and Belgium towards the end of 1993, by the buying up, slaughter, and removal from the market of over 1 million pigs.  The cost of this was borne partly by the EU Budget and partly by the German and Belgian authorities.  All of these measures had positive effects on market prices.</P>
    <P>With effect from this week the Commission has introduced a third special scheme of export refunds for the sale of pigmeat to Eastern Europe which will remove a further 40,000 tonnes of product from the market, and will serve to alleviate the difficulty on the EU market significantly.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, that pigmeat prices are still at a low level, and while I am grateful to the Commission for action already taken, I will continue to monitor the position closely with a view to seeking further action at EU level as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Compatibility of forestry with the environment, including the landscape, is now a major consideration, and is in fact a condition of grant aid under the forestry programme. This is implemented through a variety of measures which include &mdash; prior inspection to identify environmental considerations &mdash; consultation with the local authority if the area is a scenic area listed in the county development plan or the 1977 Inventory of Outstanding Landscapes &mdash; Forest Service Guidelines on Forestry and the Landscape, compliance with which is a condition of grant aid. The guidelines, which were introduced in 1992, cover shape, diversity, scale, margins, views and open spaces.  These guidelines apply to Coillte Teo as well as to the private sector, but will not, of course, have applied to forests planted in earlier times.</P>

      <P>I agree that there was some confusion in relation to the qualifying age for special beef premium during the introduction of the CAP reform regime.  Under EU regulations male cattle have to be at least eight months old at the time of application for ten months premium and at least 21 months old at time of application for the 22 month premium.  Some farmers applied on male cattle a month later than was allowed, strictly speaking, because they genuinely believed those animals were eight months or 21 months as required.</P>
      <P>In essence this problem arose because exact dates of birth of male cattle are not being registered by farmers at present. My Department is pursuing the introduction of an administrative document system which will specify exact dates of birth in future and this will resolve the problem in the long term.</P>
      <P>To resolve the particular problem which arose in 1993, I have decided, after consultation with the EU Commission, to apply a months's tolerance to allow payment on such animals applied on during January/February 1993 and June 1993 application periods.  Details of this change were publicised last week.  I am satisfied that this measure will resolve the problem which arose in relation to January/February and June 1993 application periods.</P>

The most heavily affected areas are mostly in eastern Europe, while damage to Ireland's forests is low.</P>
      <P>The most important probable causes of forest damage are adverse weather, insects, fungi, forest fires, human actions, damage by game and air pollution.  Air pollution is considered by some countries to be the essential factor affecting forest health and in others as a factor leading to the weakening of forest ecosystems. It has not been an identifiable cause in damage to Irish forests.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department have sought a reduction of EU controls on the concentration of agricultural pesticides in drinking water. In fact, a new body of EU legislation, part of which has already been adopted by Council, tightens the controls on the approval and use of pesticides, based on the most up-to-date scientific information. I have supported the measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> I am fully aware of the potential risks of pesticide contamination of drinking water.  The present standards for water quality were established in the seventies on the basis of what is known as the precautionary principle, namely that pesticide presence should not exceed the lowest measurable level.  There have been major scientific advances since that time and several member states are now calling for a review of the water standards on the grounds that they should be related to the toxicity of the various pesticides as is the case in fixing maximum levels of residues in foodstuffs.  It is recognised that any such review might well result in more stringent standards for some pesticides and less stringent ones for others.  Any such changes would have to ensure that human health and the environment were adequately protected. I have supported the proposal for such a review.</P>
    <P>I would stress that these are only suggestions at present.  The question of pursuing them is a matter for the EU Commission service responsible for environment matters.  In this regard the Commission has commenced a procedure of consultation with member states and other interested parties on the subject. In the meantime the present standards remain in force.</P>

The unpaid farmwork of women is measured by the CSO in the regular series of EU farm structure surveys.  The detailed results of the 1991 Census of Agriculture to be published shortly will also include estimates of the total labour input of women on farmwork whether as a holder, spouse or other family member.</P>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, which govern the disabled drivers scheme, provide that the vehicle of a qualifying disabled person, who has satisfied all medical and non-medical requirements of the scheme, including the required adaptation of the vehicle to take account of the claimant's particular disability, is exempt from road tax.  The current scheme has its origins in the Finance Act, 1968, which introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted and used by disabled persons who were wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs.  The 1989 Regulations <Col N="1729" /> extended the qualifying medical categories of disability and the scheme currently benefits some 3,000 severely mobility impaired disabled persons.  At present my Department is finalising a comprehensive review of the scheme; in this regard, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 53 of 1 February 1994.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time he commenced insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> made a large number of recommendations for changes to the pensions system, including increasing the number of paid contributions required to qualify for pension, introducing a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime and also recommended that the arrangements for taking account <Col N="1732" /> of pre-1953 contributions should be abolished.</P>
    <P>The report and the recommendations are at present being studied within my Department and I intend, in due course, to bring forward proposals on the issue addressed in the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case for whom details were supplied, the person concerned would not qualify for pension even if his pre-1953 contributions were taken into account in calculating his yearly average of contributions.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions applicable to the receipt of free electricity allowance is that the claimant must reside alone or only with certain excepted categories of people.  These categories include any dependant children up to age 18.  In the case of a dependent child in full-time education, the age limit is extended to 21 years.  This is in line with the rules governing entitlement to child dependant allowances payable with various social welfare pensions.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded a free electricity allowance from December 1991.  At the time, one of his two daughters was aged 20.  However, after she reached age 21, she no longer qualified as his dependant and his allowance was no longer payable.</P>
      <P>If there is a change in the composition of his household, it is open to the person concerned to re-apply for the free electricity allowance at any time.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance administered by my Department is available only to people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children or persons who, because they are so permanently incapacitated, could not get help in an emergency.  The number of people getting the allowance at present is about 114,000 at an annual cost of about £20 million.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of pensions from other countries may, depending on the level of their pensions, qualify in addition for old age pension at a reduced level from my Department.  In that event, they could also qualify for free telephone rental allowance subject to satisfying the normal conditions of the scheme. Extending the allowance to additional categories would have financial implications. Statistics to enable a costing of the proposal put forward by the Deputy are not readily available, but if he has a particular type of situation in mind I would be happy to consider the matter further.</P>
      <P>Two important improvements in the free telephone rental allowance were announced in last month's budget.  A pensioner being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance will in future retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance where previously it would have been discontinued because the living alone condition would no longer have been satisfied.  Also, a pensioner aged 75 or over and no longer living alone will retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance.</P>

This comprises 1 superintendent, 3 sergeants and 15 gardaí, including a detective garda. Two gardaí from Cahir station retired earlier this month.  However, I understand that one replacement garda will be assigned to the station later this week and it is intended to assign two further gardaí there as soon as possible, thus restoring manpower levels at the station to an overall strength of 22.

      <P>Carlow County Council has submitted proposals in relation to improvements to Carlow Courthouse at an estimated minimum cost of £274,000.  All this is targeted at works which are deemed essential if the basic fabric of the courthouse is to be preserved.</P>

      <P>I fully accept that works beyond those required for maintenance of the fabric are desirable and that, in this courthouse, as in others, the provision of resources necessary to cater for the needs of the disabled deserves special attention.

      <P>The position regarding the allocation of grants for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads is set out in the reply to Questions Nos. 327 and 339 of 26 January, 1994.  Details of the scheme of specific grants referred to were issued to the local authorities on 4 February, 1994.</P>

      <P>Delay in completing these inspections is due to the large number of food processing premises involved.</P>
      <P>The plants which have not yet been inspected are operating normally. I am not aware that any delay in carrying out inspections has had an adverse effect on output or employment.</P>

      <P>He was not paid the advances of the 1993 ewe premium as he had no quota. He was recently allocated a quota of 20 from the national reserve.  However, he received an overpayment of £1,099.87 under the 1992 ewe premium and the premium due under the 1993 scheme will be offset to reduce this overpayment.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his 1993 cattle headage grant on 14 February 1994.  He was paid an advance of his 1993 suckler cow premium on 29 November 1993 and payment of the balance cannot be made until all the applications received from him in 1993 have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. The processing of November 1993 applications means that in most cases payment of the final 40 per cent of premium will not start before late March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Blair House Agreement was concluded between US and Union negotiators in November 1992.  As the Deputy will be aware, I had major reservations on this agreement from the very outset.</P>
      <P>My major concern related to the volume restriction on subsidised exports and in particular the proposed modalities for its implementation which would have necessitated immediate substantive cuts in Union exports of a number of products in particular beef and some dairy products. This commitment could not have been accommodated within the outcome of CAP reform and this was not acceptable to me.  I also had concerns relating to certain other aspects of the Agreement including the need for acceptance of the Union's approach to market access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined my concerns at all relevant Union fora and I raised them at every opportunity in bilateral discussions with the Commission, Union Ministers and representatives from countries outside the Union.  In the event, on 20 September <Col N="1775" /> 1993 the Joint General Affairs-Agriculture Council reaffirmed that the Union must ensure that its international commitments were compatible with the CAP and that the outcome must not jeopardise the CAP or its basic principles. Furthermore, the Council, at the insistence of a number of other Ministers and myself laid down guidelines for the Commission for the conduct of further negotiations.</P>
    <P>These further negotiations culminated in another agreement with the US early last December in which significant adjustments were secured and which are now part of the final outcome on agriculture. The main modifications secured related to the export support commitments, market access and the peace clause.  By comparison with the Blair House Agreement, the revised arrangements will allow the Union in the period up to 1999 to export some additional 362,000 tonnes of beef, 146,000 tonnes of dairy products, 8 million tonnes of cereals and 269,000 tonnes of poultry and eggs.  The acceptance of the Union's market access arrangements will help to safeguard Union preference while the extension of the peace clause will ensure that Union agriculture support measures are not subject to undue challenge in the GATT.</P>
    <P>These modifications almost fully address the concerns I expressed regarding the Blair House Agreement.  I am satisfied therefore that the outcome of the Round should not impose undue constraints over and above the CAP reform decisions.</P>
    <P>However, in the event that additional measures might be necessary in some sectors I secured explicit assurances at the Agriculture Council in December that, if this was the case, any consequential measures would be based on principles already agreed and in particular that any such measures would be shared out fairly, taking account of the circumstances of certain categories of producers and of the most affected regions.  The council also, at my specific request, asked the Commission to make full use of its statutory <Col N="1776" /> powers to ensure stability on internal markets adversely affected by commitments made within the GATT.</P>
    <P>While the GATT outcome is therefore much more positive than would have been the case under the Blair House Agreement this is not to say that it will not present some challenges for the agriculture sector.  It will be necessary for the sector to become more market-led and competitive and this is an approach I have been advocating for some years. Based on results to date I am confident that the industry will meet the coming challenges.  I for my part will continue to develop policies to assist the industry to become more competitive and will seek to ensure that the implementation arrangements of the GATT agreement protect Irish agri-food interests.</P>

He has a quota of 30 and payment of the advance <Col N="1777" /> of the first and second instalments was made on foot of this quota on 24 July 1993.

However, the person named was paid for a higher number of ewes in 1991 than in any of the previous three years and he does not therefore qualify for an allocation from the reserve.</P>

      <P>Trade in live cattle between member states of the European Union is governed by harmonised rules which do not provide for the imposition of a rest period.  Nevertheless, importers are entitled to seek whatever standards they wish in their private purchasing contracts and are always encouraged by my Department to exercise maximum vigilance in regard to the health of imported animals.  This has become particularly significant since the removal of frontier controls.</P>
      <P>Regarding the recent press reports on BIV I understand that a small number of positive serological reactions have been confirmed in a herd in Great Britain, but no virus has been isolated.  The fact that there is a serological reaction to BIV does not mean that the disease is present.  All information to date shows that it is a non-pathogenic virus.  In any case there is already in place a ban on the exportation of cattle (with very minor exceptions) from the UK to Ireland or to any other EU country.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office estimates aggregate income for the overall farm sector.  These estimates are used in drawing up the national accounts, including estimates of national income.  The CSO draws on a variety of sources in making its estimate of aggregate farm income, including information from my Department.

This is followed by a second estimate, published in the following January or February and a final estimate about July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc carries out a National Farm Survey (NFS) on an annual basis.  The <Col N="1783" /> survey is based on a sample of about 1,400 farms which is chosen in association with the CSO to be representative of the different categories of farm and enterprises within Irish agriculture.  Information is collected on output, costs, incomes and performance on Irish farms. The survey does not collect information on the level of off-farm income earned by farmers.</P>
    <P>The two data sources provide different, but complementary information about income and cost developments in the farming sector.  The CSO produces estimates of aggregate income for the sector, while the Teagasc survey provides information on different farming systems and farm size categories.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above data sources, the CSO conducts a household budget survey (HBS) every seven years.  The next such survey is to be conducted this year.  The accounts provided by participating households are used by the CSO to estimate households' disposable income and a broad regional analysis is conducted.  Farm households are included in the survey in proportion to their representation in the total number of households.  The results of the survey in relation to the participating farm households include information both on the farm and the off-farm income sources (e.g. State transfers), of the household.</P>

      <P>Restrictions on the re-transmission of television broadcasts from other member states are now prohibited by European Union law except in certain limited circumstances.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219, 220 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that, as in the case of previous referenda, the Government intends to pursue an information campaign in the run-up to the divorce referendum. The details of the campaign will be announced in due course.  There are no proposals to fund the campaigns of groups who oppose the Government's proposals.  The effect of High Court decisions is that, while the Government has a duty to explain the implications of any referendum proposals to the public and a right to spend public moneys in so doing, there is no obligation, on the part of Government, to fund groups who oppose those proposals.</P>

      <P>This is a matter for RTE, who are aware of difficulties in obtaining satisfactory reception of its television services in this area. The problem is related to the local terrain which shields the area from the main RTE transmitter at Mount Leinster.  In October 1991 a transposer was provided at Inistioge which now provides service to all but a small number of homes in the Carrickmourne area.</P>
      <P>RTE report that they are investigating possible solutions to the problem at present.  If a suitable solution is identified RTE hope that the necessary resources will be available to implement it by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned and is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  I have made inquiries from the Mater Hospital and have been informed that the person in question was placed on the waiting list for coronary artery by-pass surgery on 4 February 1992.  The hospital is unable at this stage to give a precise admission date for his operation.  However, if the person feels that his condition has deteriorated he should contact his general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight his case to his consultant.</P>
      <P>In 1993 I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital.  In addition in 1993, I provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>The major programme of refurbishment at the National Cardiac Surgical Centre is ongoing.  I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development which is nearing completion includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme, including heart transplantation.</P>
      <P>This development, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of coronary artery by-pass grafts performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>if she will ensure that persons (details supplied) in County Wicklow who are being denied access to a school bus to bring them to school are granted a bus pass in view of the hardship it is causing and the fact that they cannot gain access to the schools in their catchment areas and are already in attendance in the County Wicklow Vocational School and had a bus pass until they were allocated a council house in Greystones from Newtownmountkennedy, County Wicklow.</Quest>

      <P>The two children in question live in the Bray/Greystones catchment area and their eligibility for school transport relates to the schools in that area.</P>
      <P>The family resided in the Wicklow catchment area but in December 1992, because of a fire in their home, they were given temporary accommodation in a location in the Bray/Greystones catchment area.</P>
      <P>The elder boy was attending school in the Wicklow catchment area.  To avoid disrupting his studies in mid-year, and because of the supposed temporary nature of the arrangement, he continued to be deemed eligible for transport to Wicklow until the end of the 1992-93 year.</P>
      <P>In September 1993, when the younger brother started his post-primary education, he was enrolled in the vocational school, Wicklow, even though places were available in Bray, until well after term had started.</P>
      <P>My Department has been advised that it is not proposed to move the family from their present accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the most that can be offered by my Department is catchment boundary transport to the school they attend, <Col N="1794" /> provided they make their own way to the catchment boundary.</P>
    <P>Catchment boundary transport is allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated.  The other proviso is that no exta cost is incurred, either by way of using an extra bus, or by re-routing an existing service.</P>
    <P>The question of the eligibility of these two pupils for full transport to Wicklow Post Primary Centre of course will be reassessed if and when they take up permanent residence in that catchment area.</P>

    <P>In view of the protracted history of this particular project and of the major demographic implications of recent and proposed housing developments for Knocklyon and adjoining areas, it is considered that the short and long-term requirements of the area, at post-primary level, need to be assessed in the light of the most recent statistical data available for primary and post-primary levels and for housing and other demographic indicators. The completion of this assessment will enable my Department to decide where the Knocklyon project stands in relation to the post-primary capital programme and to the many other major building projects at present proceeding through the various stages of architectural planning.  It is hoped to have this <Col N="1799" /> assessment completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There are three post-primary schools in Lucan.  The following statement, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report, sets out up-to-date statistical details on the post-primary and primary schools in the Lucan area.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received applications for grant-aid towards the provision of additional accommodation at two of the post-primary schools in Lucan &mdash; Lucan College and Colaiste Phadraig, CBS.  These applications are being assessed at present.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention at present to commission an independent study of the future requirements for second-level education in Lucan.  However, my Department is carrying out a major review of Lucan and its adjoining areas to determine the short and long term post-primary requirements in the light of current primary and post-primary statistics and taking into account housing developments and other demographic indicators.</P>
