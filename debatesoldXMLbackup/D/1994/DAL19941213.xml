      <P>The Whips met earlier this morning and agreed that No. 16, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Immunity) Bill, 1994, should be taken.  Subsequent to that the Government had to meet to discuss amendments to that Bill.  The Government has not completed its discussions on those amendments because they were received yesterday evening and Departments did not have an opportunity before this morning to make observations on them.  In view of that the Government is proposing that instead of proceeding with No. 16 immediately two hours should be given to statements on the European Council meeting in Essen if that can be agreed by the House.  The Government is well aware that it does not have a majority in the House and if the House decides otherwise, so be it.  Nevertheless, the Government considers the extra time is necessary to finalise its consideration of the amendments to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of the House agreeing to take the statements, we propose that they be brought to a conclusion within <Col N="990" /> two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening statement by the Taoiseach and a main spokesperson of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Democratic Left Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case and the statements by each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case.  The proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 16, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m. today by putting the necessary questions from the Chair forthwith and successively.  On conclusion of No. 16, the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith until Thursday, 15 December 1994.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat puzzled as to the reason the Government has not been able to consider those amendments.  I understand there was a Government meeting this morning and I would have expected that, given that this was the most urgent business, it would have been considered first.  Therefore, I do not understand why a further two hours is necessary for consideration of the matter.  I wish to make it clear that I do not believe it desirable for anybody to be rushed unduly when considering matters of importance.  However, there is a danger that the House will look a little less than it ought if its Members are seen simply to be marking time by making statements for two hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government met at 10.30 this morning and we have gone a long way in considering the amendments. The Government will table a small number of amendments.  We are nearing completion but the tidying up operation and the preparation of the <Col N="991" /> amendments for the Dáil has to take place.  If the Dáil wishes to proceed on the basis of the present position, that is its prerogative.  It is traditional to make statements in the House after a summit and this provides an opportunity to finalise business and deal with it more effectively in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is traditional to have statements on summits, we are not living in traditional times.  I think an hour would be more than sufficient for statements on Essen; I do not believe we should devote two hours to it.  I hope that by 1.15 p.m. we will begin the debate on the important Bill for which this House is meeting today.  My party is prepared to allow the Government one hour for statements on the Essen Summit and then we should commence the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is advisable to start discussions or statements on Essen at this point.  I heard about this possibility only five minutes ago &mdash; it was not raised at the Whips' meeting which my party attended.  This is not a proper way to deal with an important European summit meeting. There should be an adjournment to allow the Government to complete its work on the Bill and present its amendments. There is no purpose in addressing a Bill when we do not have the Government amendments.  There should be an adjournment of at least an hour or, if necessary, an hour-and-a-half. There is little point in coming in here and making <i>pro forma</i> statements on Essen which have no real relevance to what happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when the amendments are completed they must be circulated and the various parties in the House given time to consider them.  That is why we are talking in terms of two hours.  I think that is reasonable.</P>

      <P>It would be no harm if the Taoiseach were to make the statement he has prepared.  I think that most Members, having received such short notice, will not be able to give the sort of response they would wish to give, but there is value in hearing what the Taoiseach has to say about the Essen Summit. I agree with Deputy Harney that the total time taken should be in the range of an hour.  Perhaps when the Taoiseach concludes his statement we could adjourn for the rest of that hour, or hour-and-a-half.</P>

      <P>That is what I am suggesting but I do not know whether other Members would agree.  It is not possible for Members, given the notice we have had about this matter &mdash; literally a few minutes &mdash; to read the Presidency conclusions so as to respond in the manner in which one ought to respond to a substantial statement of this nature.  I am simply making the proposal; I am not pressing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council in Essen on Friday and Saturday last, 9-10 December 1994, accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
      <P>This was a business-like European Council conducted in a very good spirit. I am glad to be able to record that a unity of purpose was displayed by all member states in our discussions.  In my view the excellent atmosphere evident in Essen bodes well for the Union as it faces the challenges of the coming years. The three new member states, Austria, Finland and Sweden, played a full and constructive part in our discussions and their presence as full members from 1 January 1995 will undoubtedly enrich the Union.  The participants in the European Council also met the Heads of State and Government and the Foreign Ministers of the Central and Eastern European countries which are already associated with the European Union through Europe Agreements and held an exchange of views with them on the strategy for leading these states towards the European Union.</P>
      <P>This was the last European Council attended by Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission.  In the Presidency conclusions, copies of which I have laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, a warm and deserved tribute is paid to the work of Jacques Delors during his term in office.  I would like to endorse this tribute from an Irish perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jacques Delors has been a great President of the European Commission and a very good friend of Ireland.  He has given the European Union a new vision and confidence.  His friendship for Ireland has been based on his belief that the European Union must be a true Union of big and small, rich and poor, and that tangible expression must be <Col N="995" /> given to this.  The Delors I and II packages which involved a massive channelling of EU funds to the poorer member states, including Ireland, underlined this approach.  I have no doubt that the personal weight and authority of Jacques Delors ensured the significance of these packages.</P>
    <P>Apart from the financial transfers made possible by the packages which bear his name, President Delors often expressed his concern to ensure that the rights of smaller and poorer states like Ireland should be protected in the EU decision-making process.  He has also been tremendously supportive of the peace process and was a key figure in the EU aid package approved at Essen on which I will elaborate later in my statement.</P>
    <P>On the European stage as a whole I can only endorse the statement in the conclusions that the name of Jacques Delors will be associated with what must be the ten most successful years of European unification.  Truly this outstanding statesman has left a singular legacy to both Europe and Ireland and I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>This was a businesslike Council. While no major initiatives of concern to the Union as a whole were taken, significant momentum was given to the work of the Union in a number of important areas.  The main focus in this regard was on three priority areas: first, in the top priority area of the economy and jobs the summit concentrated on continuing and strengthening the strategy of the Commission White Paper to consolidate growth, improve the competitiveness of the European economy and &mdash; given the still intolerably high level of unemployment &mdash; create more jobs for our citizens; second, the focus was on ensuring the lasting peace and stability of the European continent and neighbouring regions by preparing for the future accession of the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe and developing in parallel the special relationship of the Union to its other neighbours, particularly the <Col N="996" /> Mediterranean countries; third, the council pursued the question of strengthening the Union's action in the area of internal security through providing the necessary legal and operational means for co-operation in justice and home affairs, in particular by deciding to conclude the Europol Convention during the French Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Council had a wide-ranging discussion on the European economy and job creation.  In advance of the summit and as a contribution to the discussion on jobs I circulated to my fellow Council members and the President of the European Commission a paper on Ireland's experience of social partnership: national and local.  I have arranged for copies of this paper to be placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I briefed the Council on the contents of the paper and in particular on its central message that in the view of the Irish Government action to create employment is required at national and local levels and under the umbrella of a social partnership agreement involving the Government, employers, unions and farm organisations.  I also pointed to the impressive results achieved in Ireland by this approach.  In the five years to 1993, GDP growth in Ireland averaged 5 per cent per year.  Non-agricultural employment grew significantly in this period, in spite of the negative effects of the recession on employment in the European Union generally.  Ireland's growth in 1994 is again likely to be among the highest in the European Union, at about twice the European Union average rate of growth.</P>
    <P>The response to my contribution was positive.  The agreed Presidency conclusions specifically noted the experience of Denmark, Portugal and Ireland in developing a framework at national level and structures and procedures at local level to support an integrated concept for development at local level.  In addition the prescriptions for job creation set out in the conclusions stress the importance of social dialogue at national level and the promotion of job <Col N="997" /> creation initiatives at local level.  Other key elements of the recommendations for domestic action by the Council, such as targeting measures at the long term unemployed and young people and the promotion of training, reflect policies adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Presidency conclusions on employment recognise that in the final analysis the primary responsibility for tackling unemployment rests with each member state.  Nevertheless the clear message from the Council was that the current economic recovery in itself will not be sufficient to conquer the European employment problem.  This applies even more so in Ireland given our comparatively higher level of unemployment. For this reason the Government has adopted a proactive approach to measures to combat unemployment. Notwithstanding the significant progress made this approach needs to be continued and intensified if we are to defeat the scourge of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In other economic related issues the European Council noted that the stability based preparation for economic and monetary union is being accomplished.  In this context Deputies will recall that Ireland and Luxembourg were the only two countries recently given a complete clean bill of health in regard to the convergence criteria in the Maastricht Treaty.  The Council also underlined the importance of maintaining the competitiveness of the European economy and welcomed the intention of the Commission to set up a highlevel group to monitor and address what is a key issue in today's global economy.</P>
    <P>Turning to trans-European networks, TENs, the European Council welcomed the final report of the Christophersen group on TENs.  Among the 14 priority transport projects endorsed by the Council were two projects of direct relevance to Ireland &mdash; the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Larne-Stranraer rail project and the Ireland-UK-Benelux road project &mdash; and one project of indirect relevance to Ireland &mdash; the British west coast main line rail project.  The endorsement of these Irish-related projects underpins <Col N="998" /> the coming together of the economies of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the essential links with Britain and beyond to other member states in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the general economic area, the Council considered the development of the information society and endorsed the work being undertaken in this key area by the Commission and the Ministers for Information and Communications.  Ireland fully supports the follow-up agenda in this area, while recognising that a satisfactory balance has to be found between opening up competition and laying down suitable ground rules.</P>
    <P>In the area of the union's external relations the main focus was on the relationships with the states of central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries.  The Council confirmed the conclusions of the European Councils in Copenhagen and Corfu that the associated states of central and eastern Europe can become members of the European Union if they so desire and as soon as they are able to fulfil the necessary conditions.  The Council adopted a comprehensive strategy for preparing these countries for accession to the Union while making it clear that negotiations on accession cannot take place until after the conclusion of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Ireland is supportive of the accession of the states of central and eastern Europe on the basis set out in the Presidency conclusions.  The European Union cannot turn its back on countries who have for many decades suffered political and economic oppression and where recently established democracies need to be nurtured.  The Union has already undertaken a comprehensive programme of assistance for these states through the association agreements concluded with them.  Eventual full accession by these countries, when the conditions are right, is the next logical step in the process.  There is no doubt that when negotiations begin major issues will have to be tackled.  In the interim period the main objective <Col N="999" /> should be to make the pre-accession strategy work and in particular to promote necessary reforms in these countries to prepare them for accession.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Mediterranean states the Council confirmed that the Mediterranean represents a priority area of strategic importance for the European Union and signalled its willingness to establish a Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a means of developing and strengthening ties across a range of areas.</P>
    <P>The main item of Council discussion under the heading of justice and home affairs was the proposed Europol Convention to set up an institutional and operational framework for police co-operation. Recognising the importance of the common struggle against international organised crime, terrorism and the threat posed by drugs, the Council decided that the convention establishing Europol should be concluded at the latest by the European Council meeting in Cannes in June next.</P>
    <P>Also under the justice and home affairs heading the Council emphasised the importance it attached to promoting tolerance and understanding and to combating racism and xenophobia.  To this end the Council approved the guidelines contained in the interim report of the consultative commission on racism and xenophobia and agreed that the European Council will adopt an overall strategy in this area at its meeting in June 1995.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the package of aid for Northern Ireland and the Border counties agreed by the Council.  I was particularly moved by the tribute paid by the Council to myself and the British Prime Minister, John Major, for our part in advancing the peace process. This reaction was emphatically underlined in the Presidency conclusions which confirmed &ldquo;the commitment of the European Union to underpin this unique opportunity for reconciliation and economic recovery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Council gave tangible expression to its support through the aid package <Col N="1000" /> which is approved.  The package will run for five years with agreed additional funding over the first three years of ECU 300 million or approximately £240 million.  The package will be reviewed at the end of three years when the level of funding for the final two years will be decided upon.  The programme of measures will pursue the central objective of reconciliation and will especially target the most deprived sections of the community.  I emphasise that no decision has been taken yet as to the North-South split of the aid package although the bulk of the aid will be allocated to the North.</P>
    <P>The European Council agreed on a united approach to the ongoing conflict in Bosnia.  This condemns the recent attacks on Bihac and calls for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb and Krajina Serb troops.  Importantly it emphasises the need to continue the humanitarian effort and to maintain the role of UNPROFOR in this regard.  We also gave our full support to the efforts of the Contact Group to find a peaceful negotiated solution to the conflict.</P>
    <P>The common approach agreed by the European Council was particularly welcome in the aftermath of the disagreement on this issue at the CSCE Summit in Budapest a few days earlier.  The European Council noted, however, that there were some positive developments at the Budapest Summit in relation, for example, to peace-keeping in Nagorno-Karabakh and the further development of the role of the CSCE as an important component of the future European security system.</P>
    <P>The Council had before it the Commission's first annual report on the application of the principle of subsidiarity. The general aim of the principle of subsidiarity is, as far as possible, to limit the imposition of regulation from Brussels and to retain responsibility at member state level.  In this regard the Commission is currently reviewing existing Community law to assess its consistency with the subsidiarity principle and the Council has requested the Commission <Col N="1001" /> to complete this report and submit proposals to it no later than June 1995.  The issue of subsidiarity is an important one in the context of gaining the trust and the support of the European public for the Union.</P>
    <P>Turning to other items in the Presidency conclusions, there is a reference to the integration of Spain and Portugal into the common policy on fisheries.  In fact, the Council urged the Fisheries Council, who will be meeting on Monday of next week, to reach agreement on the conditions to apply to Iberian vessels in Community waters after 1 January 1996.  I should add that this statement by the European Council does not in any way hinder the Irish negotiating objective of ensuring that reliable controls remain in place to protect the stocks of fish in our waters after Iberian access is increased in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the conclusions and the Deputy can inspect them in the Dáil Library if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the European Council's reaffirmation of the Union's firm commitment to indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased that we focused on the Union's relations with Africa.  In this context, Ireland has been pressing for a more active Union role in Rwanda.  I am pleased that the European Council has taken up the issue and stressed the extreme urgency of dealing with the refugee problem, supporting the Government of Rwanda and encouraging national reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like briefly to advert to the discussion which the European Council had over dinner on last Friday night.  This took the form of a general discussion on the future of the European Union which allowed for a frank exchange of views addressing a longer term agenda.  The discussion ranged <Col N="1002" /> from the agenda for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference to the shape of the Union well into the next century.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there are major challenges facing the Union in the years ahead.  The 1996 Intergovernmental Conference which will, of course, coincide with the Irish Presidency is the next major item on the Union's agenda. The Intergovernmental Conference will have to address the issue of closer integration whilst also creating an institutional framework capable of accommodating a much enlarged Union. These issues will have major implications for all existing member states, not least Ireland.  In this regard the proposed White Paper on Foreign Policy and the related public seminars on the key issues should be expedited as soon as possible.  This will enable the public to participate in the debate and to be informed on the issues if they have to decide on them by way of referendum in the aftermath of 1996.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed at that dinner that, under the Spanish Presidency in September of next year, there would be a one day special meeting of the Heads of Government to consider again the objectives to be decided upon at the Intergovernmental Conference which, as we all know, will fall within the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>For me the position is clear.  Membership of the European Union and the fullest participation in the Union has been and will be fundamental to Ireland's economic and political interests.  I believe that this view will be endorsed again by the people if they are called upon to do so in the future.  My wish for Europe in the 21st century is, therefore, for an ever closer Union living in peace and prosperity and in which Ireland is playing a full part.</P>

      <P>From all appearances and accounts the Essen Summit was a low key affair.  There was much interesting personality news but it appears to have been a workman-like summit.  Like the Taoiseach, I wish to pay tribute to <Col N="1003" /> Jacques Delors on his retirement.  He is a man who has been good for Europe and good for Ireland and we should remember that.  We should also be conscious that as somebody of the stature of Jacques Delors moves off the European stage, there is a danger that the momentum will decrease for some time.</P>
      <P>It is clear that by and large the Irish people have had a positive view of our EU membership.  Since we joined the Community in 1973 there have been many benefits for this country in material terms.  Those benefits can be seen everywhere we go &mdash; the new roads, the development programmes under Leader and many other improvements in both urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>We as a country face a much more challenging period in Europe because as the debate widens to include East and Central Europe, there will be clearly a difference in Ireland's role.  Our place will change on the spectrum of wealth when membership of the EU is extended to east and central European countries.  It will probably be more difficult for our people to recognise the benefits that Europe will offer to them because they may not be quite so tangible as they have been over recent years.  Our opinion will have to mature in regard to how we can contribute to Europe as opposed to constantly asking how Europe can contribute to us and to our development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major area of discussion at the Essen Summit was unemployment, probably the most insidious, damaging problem in all European countries. Unemployment in this country eats into every facet of our society.  It disturbs families and communities and creates other difficulties such as an increase in crime.  Until the European Union tackles that problem in a realistic way and returns more of our people to employment, all the other benefits that will flow from European membership will be minimised.  I welcome the fairly indepth discussion that took place at the <Col N="1004" /> Essen Summit about the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are certain other areas which require discussion.  For years, there has been much talk about reducing nonwage labour elements and helping younger and older unemployed people. When I use the term &ldquo;older&rdquo; I mean those in their 40s who are considered old in the workforce.  The best many of the unemployed in that age group can hope for is to secure part-time work from time to time until they reach retirement age, which is tragic and damaging to society.</P>
    <P>We must look at the organisation of work and how to make it more flexible, particularly in rural areas where farming may no longer be viable and people must supplement their income from other sources, by working a half day in a local factory or whatever.  We face major changes in work practices and unless we adapt to them young people will have no hope for the future.  They will not secure the same kind of employment we were lucky enough to have. When people left school in the 60s they were said to be malingering or dossing if they did not have a job within five or six weeks.  Nowadays young people will have left school for many years before they secure satisfactory employment. The work flexibility programmes which are being discussed must take into account changing work practices.</P>
    <P>We need to look at a wage policy.  It is appropriate, since we are involved in negotiations for a new Government, that workers and employers recognise that there must be changes in wage practices.  Wage increases must match productivity.  A company cannot survive if it faces huge wage increases while selling fewer products.  Until we have the correct balance between productivity and wage increases people will be made redundant and companies may ultimately close down.  The future wage policy must be one into which all sides will buy.  It is easy for employers to say they want to keep wages at a certain level but employees are as vital to the future of a company as any management <Col N="1005" /> structure and unless they are involved in discussions a wage policy will not work.</P>
    <P>Many of the programmes Ireland is receiving assistance with, such as the Leader programmes, are effective. There are a number of integrated development programmes in Sligo, Carlow, Kilkenny and Cork where broad based local initiatives widen many people's horizons.  This has a stabilising effect on rural communities and such initiatives need to be expanded to keep young people in their local communities.</P>
    <P>There is need to recognise that environmental and social services projects are proper parts of our work ethic. For too long, many aspects of Irish life ignored the advantages of recognising the services given by many in areas which would now be considered in the black economy, for example, house minding, child minding and caring for the aged, sick and handicapped.  They are the poor relations in society.  Unless we take courageous steps to recognise the importance of these services employment will not grow and people will not have their dignity restored to them through being involved in work.</P>
    <P>Another major area of discussion at the Essen Summit was the Union's relationship with central and eastern Europe.  A number of countries have agreements with the EU &mdash; Poland, Hungary, Slovak, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania.  Discussions are underway to add the Baltic States &mdash; Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia. Enlargement of the Union to the east has major implications for us and other EU members which we underestimate at our peril.  The economic base of these countries, the huge numbers of those dependent on the agricultural sector and their products, which will have access to European markets, will affect our agricultural policies and economic base.  Unless we recognise this and prepare for it we may well see a decline in our own growth.  This poses a major challenge to all companies.  They must expand their horizons and ensure they <Col N="1006" /> are in a position to capitalise on the benefits of the wider European market.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the more wealthy countries with strong companies were the main beneficiaries of the open market but it is time to recognise that small is beautiful and that small companies selling high quality products have just as good a chance of making inroads to the new European markets.  There are huge opportunities for Ireland if we meet the major challenges facing us.</P>
    <P>The stability of the Southern rim, the Northern African countries, Turkey and Malta was also discussed at Essen.  It is important to have good relations between these countries and the EU and I am sure there will be further discussions on that issue.</P>
    <P>An area of major interest was the discussion on Northern Ireland and obviously the Irish people are deeply committed to and concerned about this. It must be evident to those in Northern Ireland who have suffered for so long that politics can and will work to improve their lives.  If solving the problem in Northern Ireland was openly a question of money we would have solved it years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just money that will solve the problem.  Obviously the 300 million ECU is vital but it must be used in such a way to ensure that at the end of the three year assessment period and the five year period mentioned here, deprived and disadvantaged communities on both sides will see real changes in their lives.  The improvements must not be just at the top with better structures between North and South, better road and rail links and many conferences and seminars but little else to commend the package to those in deprived communities.  Unless the money is used to the advantage of the deprived we will not see the kind of progress we expect from the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In warmly welcoming the 300 million <Col N="1007" /> ECU we wish to thank other EU members for their assistance in this matter and support for the peace process.</P>
    <P>This additional money will not be subtracted from the money given by the British and Irish Governments to Northern Ireland.  It must be targeted at the communities which have suffered most from the troubles in Northern Ireland as that is where most of those who were killed came from and where most of those affected by tragedies, crime and unemployment come from. Unless this money is used in such an enlightened way we may well be asking in five years time what has happened in these communities to the Mary's and John's that their lives have not improved in any way.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with justice and home affairs.  As markets open up, freedom of movement increases and borders disappear there is a fear that criminals will be able to wander freely throughout Europe.  There is also the fear of drug trafficking and all sorts of contraband being moved back and forth.  It is important that the Europol Convention be set up quickly so that there is an operational framework that is not too intrusive on trade yet at the same time provides the protection that people expect and does not allow escaping criminals free access to neighbouring countries.  The danger attaching to the growth of racism and xenophobia, and the need to promote tolerance and understanding were discussed extensively during the Maastricht Treaty debate.  I have heard it said that this is a side issue, it is not.  As unemployment is an insidious force in our society, so too is the growth of xenophobia and racism as they damage community relations at the most fundamental base, at street and village level where people feel under threat because those from other places or countries are taking jobs they would expect to be available for their children.  This sense of threat has to be removed and unless there is an acceptance in Europe of the need to combat xenophobia and racism they will <Col N="1008" /> become a much bigger factor in society in future.</P>
    <P>There are probably many vital areas I have not touched on, because we have had to prepare speedily for this debate, but I welcome the discussion on the Community's relationships with Africa &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, had an involvement in this. From my work in Africa &mdash; I visited Rwanda during the summer &mdash; I know there is the sense that Europe is quick enough to make a financial response to the crisis as they arise but is less speedy in responding in a political way &mdash; I do not mean with a party-political emphasis &mdash; to the needs of governments, or overthrown governments as the case may be, in some of these countries.</P>
    <P>Sadly, in the 12 to 15 years I have been involved in development work, countries that were beginning to develop have gone back to where they were and in some cases further back.  In the years to come, the European Council or the Council of Foreign Ministers will have to recognise that it may take more courage than sending so many thousand million ECUs or a Lomé Convention package to tackle the problem of total deprivation in these countries and may mean more involvement in the structures of these countries.  I do not mean the economic structures, as economic structural programmes have caused poverty but courageous steps.  I hope we will be able to move from handing out money to a more in-depth involvement.  Perhaps over the coming years I will have an opportunity to see how the commission works in this area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recommended that the proposed White Paper on foreign policy be brought forward as quickly as possible. As we move towards 1996 and the debate on the intergovernmental conference, we do not want two or three weeks of mass media soakage telling people what is going on and then it disappearing. We know from experience that it takes time and dedication to inform the Irish people of the very complex matters that will be discussed at the intergovernmental conference in 1996. <Col N="1009" /> For that reason the publication of the White Paper and the continuation of the seminars is a very good way to start the debate and I hope people will be informed through radio and television before major decisions are taken in 1996.</P>

      <P>Events at home meant the Council meeting in Essen did not get the notice or attention that a Council meeting normally would.  Notwithstanding that, the Taoiseach described it as a businesslike meeting but there were no major initiatives, understandable perhaps because of the situation in Germany in recent months.  The German leadership has had 17 or 18 elections, including a general election, over the past 12 months and obviously the time and attention that could be given to European Union business was limited. It was significant that the two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden were in attendance as well as Austria but it is a matter of regret to me and many others that the Norwegians were not at the meeting and will not be joining the European Union on 1 January 1995. During the course of discussion on the European Communities Bill over the past couple of weeks, all parties agreed to welcome all four applicant countries but regrettably the Norwegians yet again have decided to stay outside the framework of European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presence of the foreign ministers of central and eastern European countries was of major significance because they will be very important in their dealings with the European Union in the coming years.  I too pay tribute to the outgoing president of the Commission, President Jacques Delors who has made a significant impact on the development of the European Union over the past ten years.  In particular his concern for <Col N="1010" /> the smaller states of the Union was of major importance.  It is regrettable that he will not continue in political life but his decision is understandable.  He has exerted enormous influence, power and energy in his involvement in the Commission, no small task over the past ten years.  On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party I pay tribute to him and thank him for that effort.  It will be difficult to find Europeans of his stature in in the future.</P>
    <P>I understand that the priorities of the summit were the economy and jobs and to strengthen the strategy of commissioning the White Paper in order to consolidate growth and improve the competitiveness of the European economy. Given the still intolerble high level of unemployment, we must keep job creation as a priority for our citizens and I question if we are still doing enough when we look at the disadvantage at which we operate and compare ourselves with the United States, Japan or the newly emerging states in Asia. We have a great deal to do in this respect.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Irish delegation on their presentation of the paper on Ireland's experience of social partnership, national and local.  I was involved in some of the preparatory work and it is very significant that it was well received by our European Union colleagues. That indicates the success we have achieved in recent years in terms of social partnership, both at national and local level.  I hope that will continue. Our growth in 1994 is likely to be the highest in the European Union, a significant indicator which, hopefully, will be continued by the new Government.</P>
    <P>In the European Union we have to keep the focus on job creation at all levels and the conclusions of the Presidency recognise, of course, that the primary responsibility for tackling unemployment lies with each member state.  There has to be a co-ordinated and very specific European Union response to this issue, otherwise we will not be able to compete and will not <Col N="1011" /> achieve the economic recovery which is necessary to enable us to make a significant impact on the high levels of unemployment in Europe.  The lack of resources directed towards research and development in Europe means we will not achieve the levels of growth and employment creation needed.  We have singly failed in comparison with the levels of investment in these areas by both Japan and the United States in recent years.</P>
    <P>The related issue of stability in preparation for economic and monetary union raised at the European Council is of major importance.  As the Taoiseach said, it is significant that Ireland and Luxembourg were the two countries held out for particular mention in terms of the convergence criteria in the Maastricht Treaty.  Obviously we have to continue along these lines in terms of fiscal and economic policy.  The Council has set up a high level group to monitor the key issue of unemployment in today's global economy.  We have to maintain competitiveness if we are to succeed in creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Work on the trans-European networks has been ongoing and the report of the Christophersen group was delivered at the European Council meeting. In the 14 major priority areas, Ireland benefits from two projects of direct relevance to us &mdash; the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Larne-Stranraer rail project and the Ireland-UK-Benelux road project &mdash; and a project of indirect relevance to us, the British west coast mainline rail project. We have been monitoring this project for a long time as we obviously have to ensure that we can get our products to the markets as quickly, efficiently and cost effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>External relations issues will be of enormous significance to the European Union during the next ten to 15 years, as will relationships with the states of central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries.  Some of our southern partners in the Union are concerned that because of the emphasis on east European countries we will not be <Col N="1012" /> able to strengthen the bond with the Mediterranean countries.  The Council confirmed the conclusions of both the Corfu and Copenhagen summits that the associated states of central and eastern Europe can become members of the European Union if they so desire, as I believe they do, as soon as they fulfil the necessary conditions.  The Council adopted a comprehensive strategy for preparing these countries for accession to the Union while also making it clear that no formal negotiations can take place until after the 1996 intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the difficulties enlargement of the Union to the east will pose for Ireland.  These difficulties have been discussed in the House on many occasions.  Ireland is supportive in principle of the accession of the central and east European countries to the Union on the basis set out in the Presidency conclusions.  I agree with the Taoiseach that there are major issues which will have to be tackled when the formal negotiations begin. There are two main reasons the central and east European countries want to be part of the European Union: first, strictly economic reasons and, second, security reasons, both of which are equally important.  I will be suggesting during the lead in to the 1996 intergovernmental conference and prior to the commencement of any negotiations that the Irish Government should look at all the areas which will present difficulties for us.  These difficulties have been articulated in recent months in the House during debates on agriculture and other issues and we need to be prepared to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Mediterranean states which will also play an important role are of strategic importance to the Union.  This was signalled at the European Council by the proposal to establish a Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a means of developing and strengthening ties across a range of areas.  The Mediterranean region has a direct link to Africa and we are all well aware of the serious political tensions which have arisen in North <Col N="1013" /> Africa in recent months.  It is very important for the European Union not only to open but to develop and maintain very strong links with the Mediterranean countries and, through them, to North Africa.</P>
    <P>On the question of justice and home affairs, I am concerned at the lack of movement in terms of Europol since agreement was reached to establish it.  It appears from documentation I have read in recent weeks that there are serious difficulties between the various states about what their police forces should be allowed to do in terms of tackling international crime, terrorism and the threats posed by drugs. Obviously we have to move as quickly as possible as international crime, the scourge of drugs and terrorism are issues with which Europe will have to contend, irrespective of the peaceful situation in Europe at present.</P>
    <P>At previous Council meetings there were long discussions on the promotion of tolerance and understanding and the need to combat racism and xenophobia. These issues will remain on the European agenda for a long time and much work has to be done in this area.  We must promote a better understanding of these issues among the public.  To a large extent Ireland has been free from these problems but nevertheless we should focus on them as we will form part of working groups within Europe which have to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>On the question of Northern Ireland, I welcome the announcement of funding made by President Delors in recent days.  This will be of major benefit to Northern Ireland.  Without going into too much detail, it will be important to ensure that that money is well spent on, for example, the development of infrastructure in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to Bosnia, an issue which has been discussed in the House on many occasions.  The events in that country in recent weeks are a tragedy, and one for which Europe has been unfairly attacked.  Our European Union partners have made a major effort to tackle this very difficult and <Col N="1014" /> complex problem.  We still have to give full support to the efforts of the Contact group which was established to find a peaceful negotiated solution to the conflict. It appears that some progress has been made and that more solidarity was expressed within the European Council than was expressed at the CSCE summit in Budapest a few days previously.  This development is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister of State's commitment to Africa.  He will agree with me that we have worked very well in addressing many of the problems on the African continent.  Africa will continue to be one of the most serious problems facing not only Europe but all the developed world during the next 20-25 years.  It was a matter of personal regret that one of the first decisions made by the caretaker Government was to reduce the amount provided in the Estimates for ODA by £12 million.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, would not have been a party to that regrettable decision if he had been at the table.  We have made international commitments in this regard and the Minister of State has worked very hard during the past two years in building up relations with the NGOs who carry out tremendous work on behalf of Ireland.  We have set about establishing Ireland as a country which wants to understand Africa and provide assistance, while other countries with much more resources have fallen down in their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he has taken a personal interest in Rwanda.  The problems in Rwanda are an indication of how badly things can go wrong on the African continent. I am worried that Rwanda is merely the tip of the iceberg and that all the efforts undertaken during the past 25 years will come to nought unless the western and developed worlds adopt a new and serious approach in terms of providing assistance to the governments of African states.</P>
    <P>On the question of the White Paper and the 1996 intergovernmental conference, many issues and major challenges will face the European Union in <Col N="1015" /> the years ahead.  Obviously the 1996 intergovernmental conference will pose a major challenge not just for the Union but also for the Irish Presidency.  I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement that there will be a special meeting during the Spanish Presidency to discuss the agenda for the conference.  I am concerned that the intergovernmental conference is being heralded as the conference to solve all the problems of the world.  I do not see it achieving that, but I am confident that the Government will be able to take on the challenges of the European Union agenda.</P>
    <P>I hope the White Paper on foreign policy and the related public seminars on the key issues will be continued and expedited.  Unfortunately, because of the political uncertainty here during the past three weeks, at least one, if not more, of the seminars has been cancelled. The first seminar in University College, Dublin was one of the best attended meetings I have ever attended, on overseas development aid and Irish foreign policy.  I hope that type of attendance materialises throughout the country.  We have set out to give the Irish people a sense of ownership of Irish foreign policy which was not the case in the past.</P>
    <P>There are many challenges facing us in our role within Europe and we should be more positive about them.  We are positive when it comes to referenda or European Union issues but we should go to Europe and put forward our policies. We may not have the same influence as the major players but we are a valuable part of the European Union. We have a role to play just as do the other small countries and we should play that role.</P>
    <P>The work done between now and 1996 is very important and the work done after the 1996 intergovernmental conference will have as its key objective a larger economically viable Europe which provides more jobs for all its citizens and ensures we will never again experience the wars and disasters which <Col N="1016" /> have bedevilled Europe this century and in many previous centuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Essen Summit was probably a low key affair by comparison with many in the past, the German Presidency was probably right to keep it that way, because this is a time when a certain consolidation is required within the European Union. There is turmoil in some member states in their attitude to Europe.  Happily, in this House there is broad consensus, by and large, but that is not so in London and in some other places.  The Germans were probably right to seek to consolidate. At the same time some very major decisions will have to be taken, not least in 1996 and its immediate aftermath. Much debate is required both here and throughout the European Union as to where we go in that regard.  In his speech the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Second, the focus was on ensuring the lasting peace and stability of the European continent and neighbouring regions by preparing for the future accession of the associated countries of central and eastern Europe and developing in parallel the special relationship of the union to its other neighbours, particularly the Mediterranean countries;</P>
      <P>That is where the crunch decisions will have to be taken during the next couple of years.  The Taoiseach also said:</P>
      <P>Eventual full accession by these countries when the conditions are right is the next logical step in the process.  There is no doubt that when actual negotiations begin major issues will have to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incoming Government should think clearly about the likely attitude of Russia to the further enlargement of the European Union.  Russia is the key to peace on this continent.  The Russians feel under a certain threat at the moment, which I can understand.  The European Union and NATO are approaching all their neighbours in a very positive way trying to recruit them <Col N="1017" /> into membership, in NATO, not as full members but as members of the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>At the Essen Summit the European Union spoke in very explicit terms about the desirability of bringing in the seven central and eastern European countries who were represented there, other than the three applicants who will join anyway on 1 January 1995.  It is easy to say that they will all join &mdash; and there are strong reasons for that &mdash; but they should not be encouraged in a total vacuum from their relationship with Russia as their relationship with Russia and the European Union's relationship with Russia will be crucial.  At present Russia is only barely a democracy.  There is huge dissent within it both centrally and regionally.  As we speak, there is war in at least some of their provinces.  The Russian army is invading one of those at this moment.  Yesterday &mdash; and probably today &mdash; people paraded in Moscow saying that Russia is about to undertake its next Afghanistan.  We have no certainty about what type of regime will rule Russia in future.  If the Russians feel threatened by an expanded European Union there could be a very serious situation for us all and the whole purpose of the European Union to bring and maintain peace on this continent could be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate here about enlargement after 1996 will probably centre around its economic aspects and consequences for this country.  It may well be that quite a head of steam and a significant lobby opposed to future enlargement will build up here during the next couple of years.  That possibility must exist on the agricultural side because any country with significant agricultural output or the capability of achieving a significant agricultural output will probably not be welcome from our point of view if we look only at our economic and commercial interests.  We should be clear even at this stage, that whatever the economic difficulties that may or may not arise, the political imperative that we should seek to <Col N="1018" /> encourage, nurture and maintain democracy in the countries of central and eastern Europe should be paramount. It should be remembered that Russia is bigger by far than all of them put together and has a greater ethnic mix than they constitute collectively.  In western Europe Russia stands as a bulwark against the possibility of what might arise from religious fundamentalism to the south of Russia and to the south-east of this continent.  What we are talking about are very important far reaching global strategies.  They will have to be taken carefully and handled with special care.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government will have the Presidency when the intergovernmental conference is held in 1996.  Ireland has rarely been cast in such a central role as it will be for the intergovernmental conference.  I hope we will be well prepared not just in terms of the physical arrangements that have to be made, but in terms of the policies we want to follow and advocate at that time.</P>
    <P>The Essen Council marked the retirement of President Delors and I too wish to pay tribute to him.  He has been arguably the most outstanding European of his generation and in time will be looked on with a similar degree of awe to that of Adenauer in his generation.  I was sorry to hear President Delors announce that he will not contest the French Presidency next year.  He would have made an outstanding President of France if elected and, because of his deep European commitment, that would have been good not only for France but for all member states. Nevertheless, he has made his decision and I understand why, particularly at his age.  We should not underestimate his contribution to the European Union. Like other small European countries, we benefited greatly from his commitment as President of the Commission, to fair play for small member states and his genuine pan-European and Community commitment to the rights of all member states, including countries such as Ireland which do not have a great deal of economic clout.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> At the Council in Cannes in June it is proposed to bring together the police forces of the European Union.  It is regrettable that this has not been done before now.  The nature of much modern crime is necessarily international; virtually by definition the only aspect of the drugs trade which is carried out in a single country is the retail side of it.  The more important and more damaging aspect is the large scale distribution and importation of drugs from places outside the European Union.  We will not be able to tackle the drugs problem effectively if it is not done at a pan-European Union level.  I hope the incoming Government will do all it can to strengthen the powers of Interpol and, specifically, a European police force.</P>
    <P>The same applies to terrorism which, I hope, will not be as pressing a problem for us as it was in the past.  Terrorism is an international problem in the sense that in many countries there are not indigenous supplies of weapons for terrorists and they are brought in from outside.</P>
    <P>I welcome what has been done in regard to Northern Ireland and President Delors must be thanked for his efforts in that context.  Without him it might not have been possible.  While this package is generous, it is only a small fraction of what is needed in the post war economy of Northern Ireland.  The net British contribution to Northern Ireland is £3.5 billion per annum.  A contribution of £240 million over a three year period, although very generous, is only a drop in the ocean.  It shows the nature of the difficulties facing Northern Ireland and the very limited extent to which we can help.  We will have to look for outside assistance.  The economic conference taking place in Belfast today is very important because most of the economic regeneration of the postviolent Northern Ireland must come from the private sector.  There is a limit to what public agencies on either side of the Atlantic can do to help.</P>
    <P>What is taking place in Bosnia is a <Col N="1020" /> cause of great regret and the best that can be said about what happened at Essen is that they agreed on a common resolution regarding the problem in Bosnia, but that will not amount to very much.  The Taoiseach contrasted it with what happened at Budapest the previous week.  To that extent it is an advance, but the problem in Bosnia is very serious.  The manner in which Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia and the socalled Krajina Serbs who live in Croatia have treated their neighbours is an appalling breach of human rights and international law.  I get a whiff of Munich about the way in which Europe as a whole has examined what the Serbs in general are doing; it is inconvenient, so we all turn away.  That is very wrong and we could pay a terrible price.  After Munich Western Europe was led to believe that a piece of paper existed which would ensure peace.  That piece of paper was signed at the expense of many millions of people and, of course, it was valueless.  If we allow the position in Bosnia to continue we could pay a very high price.  It will not be only Muslims and Croatians who will pay the price in the future.</P>
    <P>The spectacle of several hundred United Nations troops held hostage by the Serbs and the United Nations and the European Union told that if they attack them as they advance on cities such as Bihac and bomb and shell Sarajevo they will obliterate the troops they hold hostage is especially unacceptable. There is scarcely a word said about that. I understand a couple of hundred of those troops are British.  Can one imagine the British Government and Parliament in any other circumstance meekly allowing their troops to be held hostage in this manner?  I have not heard any great noise from London or other countries whose troops were taken hostage by the Serbs.  This is potentially very dangerous and while I welcome the level of agreement reached in this regard, it was not an agreement to do anything but merely to condemn what is taking place in Bosnia.  Much more than that is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The Taoiseach stated that the European Council at Essen put great pressure on the Fisheries Council, which will meet on Monday next in Brussels, to try to finalise the arrangements for Iberian fishing rights.  I am not sure if what was decided at Essen is of much help.  I do not have any objection to the Portuguese part of the Iberian fishing fleet because, by and large, the Portuguese have obeyed the rules.</P>

I foresee a very difficult position for us after 1 January 1996 unless whoever will be appointed Minister with responsibility for fisheries next week is able to block what I think a majority of the member states are now intent on. We must remember that Ireland has more useful fishing waters than the whole of the remainder of the Union.</P>

      <P>We have a very valuable resource and we alone will be the losers if the Spanish fishing fleet is allowed to wipe it out.  Fishing comes into a strange category within the European Union.  There is no suggestion, for example, that if there were oil under our waters out to the edge of the Continental Shelf anybody else would be entitled to it or if gold or any other valuable mineral were found we would not be entitled to it.  For some curious reason we are not entitled in priority to the fish that swim over that seabed &mdash; a hugely valuable resource.  Some of the member states of the European Union have virtually wiped out their own fishing grounds; there is almost nothing left in the North Sea.  They all descend on us and we have to freely give up our resource.  That is the one aspect of the European Community on which I felt <Col N="1022" /> we fared badly at the outset.  I suppose we contented ourselves by thinking we did very well in so many other areas that we had to put up with what has gone wrong in fishery policy.  The Council meeting on 21 December is of the greatest importance and there will be long term repercussions for us if we cannot get a satisfactory arrangement there.  I do not know the prospects of vetoing it in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute on the Essen Summit, although it is not my area of speciality.  Given today's events and the need to prepare notes quickly my contribution may not be as cohesive and comprehensive as I would have liked.</P>
      <P>It is fitting to pay tribute to the work of President Jacques Delors.  During the past few years he steered the European Community, now the European Union, along a rather difficult path and has managed to negotiate on the obstacles frequently placed in his way.  He is noted for his abiding concern for European citizens and for a social Europe. President Delors should be acknowledged as an international statesman of high repute.  It is important that we record our appreciation of his political endeavours down through the years. Many of the obstacles placed in his path would have defeated a lesser man or woman than President Delors, particularly the UK's intransigence on the Social Charter and the pressure of demands for enlargement.  There was constant tension between those seeking a cohesive social Europe and the other forces favouring nothing more than a free trade area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> At Friday night's summit dinner President Delors spoke of the need for fundamental reform if the whole project of a European Union is not to come to a halt.  I would like to think those words will set the tone for future development.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that Europeans demand and deserve more than an <i>ad hoc</i> group of states gathered under the umbrella of free trade.  They deserve a Europe in which the rights of all are guaranteed both centrally and locally. The ethos behind a social Europe is best exemplified by the Social Chapter which, unfortunately, has yet to be enforced throughout the Union.  President Delors laid the foundations for the Social Chapter but a great deal of work remains to be done.  Ireland must play its full part in that work.  The people of Europe deserve a fully democratic Europe.  We need a Europe which is inclusive rather than exclusive, in which democracy is underpinned by transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>Above all, the people of Europe deserve a European Union whose leaders are committed to eradicating the plague of unemployment and poverty which affects nearly every family in this country as well as people in the other member states.  The omens for tackling that problem appear rather better than they did a year ago.  After many months of deliberation at Council level, the summit endorsed Jacques Delors' job strategies, his White Paper on growth and competitiveness and the follow up papers.  At a time when unemployment throughout the European Union is at an unacceptable level, a concerted policy to tackle unemployment, poverty and disadvantage is vital to Europe's future. There can be no sustainable future without peace and work.  The inequities cannot be sustained and if they are not tackled huge numbers of people will be marginalised.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow to develop a two-tier Europe similar to that which exists in our society.  We must eradicate the difficulties for the poor of Europe in terms of unemployment and poverty.  We must <Col N="1024" /> consider ways in which the Commission would play a more effective role in these areas.  It is not good enough for the Prime Ministers at the summit to say that these are primarily the responsibility of the member states.  In this regard the paper on trans-European networks endorsed by the summit lays the groundwork for developments in towns of a common industrial policy. This is a matter which I and my party have urged and supported.  We have argued the need to recognise that the Irish agricultural sector benefited tremendously under the Common Agricultural Policy.  At the same time huge numbers of industrial workers were victims of political forces and events that led to many joining the dole queues.  As a peripheral state in Europe it is clear that a common industrial policy would go some way to redress the disadvantage with which we must cope.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about developments that came to light at the Essen Summit, for example, the dramatic reduction in the number of European Commission legislative proposals in the past year, revealed in the subsidiarity report, is particularly worrying.  I fully endorse the concept of subsidiarity.  However, until all European member states have enshrined the highest standards of social protection in national legislation we must continue to look to Brussels for legislative initiative.  We are aware of the benefits of European regulations and directives &mdash; for example, the well-being of many working women has been improved and Irish women dependent on social welfare were given equality under European directives.  The Government is slow to initiate legislation in these areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis in the subsidiarity report on increased consultation. In this regard I would welcome an increase in the number of White Papers and Green Papers which would enable interested groups and individuals to fully assess the impact of proposed legislation before it is agreed.</P>
    <P>In common with a number of recent <Col N="1025" /> summits, the Essen Summit was dominated by the prospect of new members joining the Union.  It is increasingly likely that countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia will join the Union in the not too distant future.  I welcome this move in principle.  Europe will only succeed as an inclusive rather than an exclusive construction, but we must be aware that this will have repercussions for us.  The road ahead will be a bumpy one.  In the next decade the European Union is likely to expand to about 25 members, including countries with vastly different economic, political and social objectives, all proceeding at different speeds and with varying degrees of enthusiasm towards completion of the Maastricht process.  The 1996 intergovernmental conference will be vital to the success of that process and Ireland will have to play its full part in that review.</P>
    <P>Summits are always dominated by a big story and at last week's summit the big story was the end of President Delors tenure as Commission President. It is worth noting that there are also the smaller stories, those that will impact on the lives of Europe's citizens.  In this regard the EU commitment to making universal the nuclear non-proliferation treaty will be welcomed by the vast majority of Europeans as it will render our continent a much safer place in which to live.</P>
    <P>One matter that will have an enormous impact on this island is the special aid package agreed for Northern Ireland.  If this money is spent wisely and in accordance with Commission guidelines &mdash; I have no reason to suspect it will not &mdash; it will help to consolidate peace.  A Europe at peace and at work is our most fundamental desire. Let us hope that the misery of war raging in Bosnia will be peacefully resolved and that after the terror we experienced and which has come to an end, hopefully in the long term, we will enjoy the fruits of peace and work, as, I hope, will all citizens of Europe.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As Europe continues to expand, more time should be made available in this Parliament to discuss in greater detail not only the broader issues but also some of the specific issues that cause great difficulties. One of the greatest problems we have faced in recent years is unemployment. It is clear that economic growth does not equal employment growth. This was much more apparent in past years but with changes in the marketplace events are different in the current climate.  While we have achieved welcome and sustained economic growth in recent years, much more so than in other European countries, we still have a serious unemployment problem. Recent efforts, particularly by this Government, have contributed to bringing to an end the rapid increase in unemployment.  Statistics show that there is consistent growth in employment, but the unemployment figures never seem to decrease very much. However, the rise in unemployment has ended and we can look forward to a reduction in the numbers unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the weekend I studied forecasts for economic growth in Europe.  While the economic indications are positive, there is no reason for us to lessen our interest in formulating new ideas or creating new areas of employment.  The more people are educated and the greater their qualifications &mdash; and here I mean education in the widest sense rather than in the pure academic sense &mdash; the better the opportunities for them in the marketplace in the future.  That matter has been tackled in recent years. Nonetheless new ideas are needed, a more radical approach, which will lead to a greater number of people between the ages of 16 and 21 remaining in some form of specific educational training. With something like 70 per cent of our population within that age group still involved in the educational process, we are one of the lowest in Europe in that respect and that figure should be raised to in excess of 90 per cent.  While some efforts have been undertaken, there is <Col N="1027" /> an urgency about it.  We must now capitalise on the economic growth in addition to the improving picture emerging within the European Union.</P>
    <P>I question the stage we are at <i>vis-àvis</i> monetary union.  There is no doubt that in recent years we have continued to fulfil the conditions and criteria to enable us to be in the first stream of countries, thereby participating in the monetary package that will emerge in the years ahead.  In the not too distant future it will be interesting to observe what happens in 1996, what decisions will be taken, how close we become to some of the larger member states in achieving monetary union.  Since our economy is very open, based essentially on exports, from the perspective of industrialists and small and large commercial businesses, we would like to achieve monetary union.  However, in this regard, the British attitude is of enormous importance to us since a huge proportion of our trade is with Britain and I do not envisage that changing. While looking forward to expanding into other markets, the United Kingdom market always will remain vital to us.  Therefore, in approaching monetary union it is important that the United Kingdom be on the same track as everybody else.</P>
    <P>Another matter I continue to believe to be an issue for us, and will be more so with an ever expanding Europe eastwards, up to the end of this decade, is our peripherality.  We have seen the Nordic countries, with the exception of Norway, join the European Union, accompanied by the further extension eastwards to which I have just referred, leaving us very much at the back door of Europe.  Whereas we were on the periphery before, we shall be on an even more remote periphery as the centre of Europe changes with additional member states joining the European Union. There is the example of the Nordic countries having a loose economic bloc arrangement in recent years which never interfered with Denmark's participation in the European Union, <Col N="1028" /> enabling them to remain involved, in a Nordic sense, with Finland, Sweden and Norway.</P>
    <P>With the United States of American on our back door I have always felt we should have a more formal, structured economic arrangement with the United States, it being a very powerful ally of ours, clearly seen at present within the context of the peace process and its involvement.  For example, I am aware of the conference on Northern Ireland to be held in Philadelphia next year to be attended by President Clinton. Ireland as a whole should have a more structured, formal arrangement with the United States that would afford us an opportunity to improve on opportunities, adding to our economic strength rather than an over-dependency on other member states within Europe.  Since it is possible for the Nordic countries to have such an arrangement there must be areas we can explore within the context of our European Union involvement, ensuring that the Americans have a bilateral economic arrangement with us.  We are all very much aware of the type of economic involvement of the United States in Ireland, for example, in many multinationals who are some of the largest employers here.  Perhaps greater opportunity exists within that context.</P>
    <P>European Union foreign policy in one sense constitutes its greatest success because of what has happened since the Second World War and what has been achieved within that period but, in another sense, it constitutes its greatest failure.  What is taking place in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia between the Croatians and Serbs is one of the most appalling vistas in eastern Europe since the Second World War.  While it was strongly contended that the holocaust in the Second World War could not recur, we are witnessing a similar one today in the former Yugoslavia.  There is no doubt that there is mass genocide, the absolute annihilation of communities, murder committed on a scale not witnessed in Europe since the end of the Second World War.  Yet all the member <Col N="1029" /> states of the European Union are unable to focus on or deal in a specific way with the happenings there, which is to be very much regretted.  Many experts speak about what is happening, about the complexities and the consequences of any action taken.  While accepting all those options, when history is written and we look back on these events, it will be asked why it was necessary for so many people to die, so many communities to be annihilated.  On the basis of European Union foreign policy, the member states have not got to grips with the problem by way of any clear view of what is happening.  In that respect we must question our view of ourselves as a neutral country.  That neutrality, in its traditional form, will not be sustainable within an ever expanding Europe.  In future we shall have to reach some conclusions on how best we can play a decisive role within the European Union to ensure the existence of a cohesive foreign policy and security system, capable of dealing with issues rapidly as and when they arise. For a wide variety of reasons, clearly that is not the case today, but will become more urgent in ensuing years. All the member states of the European Union will have to devise better mechanisms to deal with crises on the scale being witnessed at present in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The other matter with which I want to deal is that of our fisheries industry. It is astonishing that any country with such a valuable asset should be effectively raped and pillaged by the fishermen of any other country.  For example, we do not have the luxury of possessing mineral, oil or gas reserves on a scale that would sustain us well into the future and render us a wealthy nation. Our two greatest assets have always been agriculture and fisheries.  Our fisheries industry has suffered intolerably. As a Member representing Waterford, a very important fisheries region, I am aware of the feelings throughout my constituency about the crisis with regard to access to the fishery waters around <Col N="1030" /> our coastline, particularly that of Iberian fishermen.  We have had the regrettable experience of the Spanish fisheries involvement in our waters.  I emphasise that there is enormous frustration at what is happening in our fisheries industry. I do not know what we will be able to achieve or what message we can bring to the meeting on Monday week to ensure the future of our fishing industry, given the tremendous possibilities for expansion.  Our fishermen and women have the right to compete for the available resources and reserves.  I hope we will take this issue seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I may as well be Taoiseach for ten minutes: I will never get the chance again.  The Essen Summit is relevant and has enormous implications for this country.  As I have said in a number of debates on foreign affairs, the people are not acquainted with what lies before them with regard to the European Union.  In the last week or two the main farming organisation, the IFA, has suddenly become alive to the possibilities that will arise with the proposed expansion of the European Union.  It is now a Union of 15 countries and it was clearly demonstrated at Essen that before the year 2000 it will be a Union of at least 21 countries.  If one were to ask people on the street to name the six countries which are about to join I do not think that even 1 per cent of the population would be able to do so.  This shows how ill-informed we are and have been.  Successive Governments have been remiss in keeping people acquainted with what is going on and what is likely to happen in the next ten to 20 years in Europe.  This will have a serious and, unfortunately, a detrimental effect on this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be prepared to face the facts.  We have been a member of the European Union for almost 22 years and have garnered tremendous benefits from our membership.  It is fair &mdash; perhaps unkind &mdash; to say that at times we have been very selfish and small-minded with regard to our membership.  We have taken everything that is there for <Col N="1031" /> the taking and given little in return.  Our days as huge net beneficiaries are quickly coming to an end.  It is important that we spell out in this national forum what lies in store for us from 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might refer to this matter in his reply.  In the past few weeks contrary statements have been issued by the former Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.  Deputy Spring was inclined to give the impression that everything in the garden was rosy and that there were no problems in terms of our future within the European Union.  The Minister of State painted a different picture and pointed out that real difficulties lie in store.  It was a much more realistic view of what we can expect to happen in years to come.  That is how I see it.</P>
    <P>Virtually no one would be able to name the six countries &mdash; the Leaders of which attended the summit at Essen &mdash; which are about to join the European Union.  They are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, with populations of which amount to almost 100 million people. We should bear in mind that these impoverished countries will be fully fledged members of the European Union within four years, perhaps sooner, and will put severe demands on the finances of the Union.  The outgoing Taoiseach did not refer to this in his statement.  No member of the Government has referred to the fact that there will be major drawbacks.</P>
    <P>I am not going to object to their membership but we should be fully advised of the consequences.  This has not been done by the Taoiseach or any Minister with a role to play in Europe or by the former Tánaiste.  Let me predict what will happen; perhaps someone will ask in four years' time why someone did not warn us of the consequences.</P>
    <P>We will hardly receive any Structural or Cohesion Funds.  Last night RTE's <Col N="1032" /> reporter in Europe, Tommie O'Gorman, informed us that these countries prior to their membership will receive £4.5 billion and that this amounts to only two-thirds of what our Government is to receive in Structural and Cohesion Funds during the next five years.  I say to Mr. O'Gorman as well as Members of this House that these countries are not even members and that we never received transitional funding in the form of a hand-out before we joined.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonably large sum but when they become members the bulk of the moneys, if not all, now being given to us, Greece, Portugal and Italy, will be given to them.  The standard of living in these countries is very low and the infrastructure poor.  Their agriculture and other indigenous industries are underdeveloped and they need this money.  I do not begrudge it to them but this will result in a huge shortfall at home and if we do not organise our affairs properly during the next four to five years we will find ourselves in dire straits at the turn of the century.  No one seems to want to know about it &mdash; we sweep the bad news under the carpet and forget about it.</P>
    <P>We face another serious setback on the question of the system of direct payments to farmers which has boosted agricultural income enormously during the past few years.  I was the Minister who eight years ago on 16 December 1986 negotiated the beef premium for our farmers upon which all the direct income payments are based.  I did so against the advice of my senior officials who said I had no chance of achieving this.  After three days and nights without sleep one would be surprised at the way these continentals can capitulate, which they did.  This has been worth a few billion pounds to this country but eaten bread is soon forgotten.  Other people are being given the credit for this achievement.  For a number of reasons direct payments will be a thing of the past.  One reason is that Germany in particular has decided these payments have been made for long enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> As a result of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; it will be shown in years to come that this has been disastrous for this country &mdash; and the GATT agreement which was inevitable we will find that these direct payments will be outlawed and made illegal.  Countries such as New Zealand, Australia, South America, Canada and the United States will be able to put our products, namely, milk, beef, pork meat and grain, on the world market for approximately half or one-third of the price for which we can currently produce them.  That is a gloomy scenario but an accurate one.  The Government should have told us this over the years instead of me having to drag it out of them.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a major debate on the Essen Summit early next year, when the new Government will have been formed.</P>
    <P>A number of people today shed crocodile tears over the state of our fisheries and the way they have been sold out.  The Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, declared that he had won a condiderable concession for Spanish fishermen at the Essen Summit. However, that was denied by the British Prime Minister, John Major, who made a rather disparaging remark to the effect that some Heads of Government could not find their way to their own parliaments with a guide dog.  If it is true that Mr. Gonzalez won such a concession, then the meeting to which the Taoiseach referred today in his statement is almost irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to Bosnia, to which the Taoiseach referred in his statement, there is no easy solution to its problems which are being glossed over by the leaders of the European Union.  They are being glossed over here also.  The problem is too complex.  RTE and other worldwide news agencies should shut out the Serbian Bosnian leaders who are deceitful and lacking in compassion. Foremost among those is Mr. Karadicz, the self-styled leader of the Bosnian Serbs.  We should ban these people from our television screens.  Why should we <Col N="1034" /> have to listen, on a daily basis, to lies and contempt for the United Nations, of which we are a part?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to reply to the various points raised by a number of Deputies in this important debate.  I agree with Deputy Deasy that it is important to have a sense of realism and honesty in dealing with these issues.  For Ireland, the next number of years are crucial and I would like to think there was a sense of realism and pragmatism with regard to the Council meeting in Essen.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised, in particular, the whole question of the accession of the countries from central and eastern Europe and the situation in Russia.  Important contributions were made in particular by the leaders of the central and eastern European countries and one important message was that economic relations with those countries should be interlinked with the development of the political and security situation. One of the Council's conclusions was that sustained and constructive dialogue and partnership with Russia on political and economic issues was crucial. I believe we should not ignore the important messages emanating from these countries.  The contributions of the EFTA countries was important also and countries such as Finland, Austria and Sweden became positively involved in the debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that there was tremendous appreciation for the work of the Taoiseach in bringing peace to Northern Ireland.  This appreciation did not come only from Chancellor Kohl, President Delors or Prime Minister Major, many other Heads of State, individually and collectively, paid tribute to the Taoiseach for the risks he took during the past two years in trying to bring peace to Northern Ireland and especially in bringing in from the cold those who have been involved in violence. Many of the Heads of State realise that what happened on this island is truly historic.  I am merely giving my <Col N="1035" /> personal perspective of how the Taoiseach is judged by his colleagues and I believe they judge him with great admiration in relation to Northern Ireland. They see the success the peace process will bring to this country and, indeed, to Europe.</P>
    <P>The peace process is quite rightly supported by a substantial aid package which is linked to the support being given by the United States.  Tribute must be paid to the US President, Bill Clinton, for the support and interest which he and the US Administration have shown in providing the back-up support we are seeing today with the investment conference on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Tributes have also been paid to President Jacques Delors who always had great vision in regard to where Europe is going.  He ensured that the interests of small states were protected at all times in the many debates over the past number of years.  I believe the new Commissioner, Monsieur Santer, will be the appropriate person to face the difficult years ahead, he has the right personality and temperament to deal with future problems.</P>
    <P>There are many points I wish to address in the time remaining but there was a reference to the fishing industry and it is important to clear up this matter. The conclusions of the European Council recognise the need to adopt measures, before the end of the year, for all Community fishing vessels.  This must take account of the Declaration on Fisheries adopted during the accession negotiations and this is a matter for discussion at the Fisheries Council meeting next week.  However, thanks to the efforts of ourselves and the French &mdash; and I speak with conviction because I was there &mdash; the Council in Essen stressed the requirement that fishing efforts must not be increased.  That was an important conclusion and it gives Ireland a framework within which to <Col N="1036" /> defend vigorously its interests during next week's Council discussion.</P>

      <P>I agree with President Mitterrand when he said that we must decide whether to approach Bosnia from a humanitarian or military point of view.  The decision has been made to support the humanitarian effort in Bosnia. President Mitterrand asked &mdash; and this is evidence that he and the other Heads of State had a sense of realism with regard to Bosnia &mdash; how many countries are prepared to commit ground troops in Bosnia.  The reality is that if one were to follow that course, it would require hundreds of thousands of troops.  The conclusions, which the Irish Government supports, intensify and continue the humanitarian effort.  They recognise and intensify the role of UNPROFOR in this regard and fully support the efforts of the contact group to bring about a peaceful negotiated solution. Many Deputies made the point that it was an improvement on the Budapest outcome, where the disagreement was a tremendous disappointment.  In Essen we saw a firmness of purpose and a sense of reality in relation to Bosnia.</P>
      <P>I made the point earlier that during the final moments of my farewell address to the foreign ministers I asked them not to forget Africa.  My final request was that they should do something special for Rwanda.  I visited Rwanda twice in the past six months, on the last occasion with President Robinson. The new Government will have to deal with the security situation in the camps in Goma and the need to support the civil administration process and provide human rights observers.  The European Union appears to be getting tired of Rwanda and I reminded the Foreign Ministers that among the Twelve there were many with a great deal of influence and power.  I asked them to deal with Rwanda as an urgent matter.</P>
      <P>Essen was a very useful summit and a great deal of good work was done.  In particular tribute was paid to the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, for what he has done for Northern Ireland.  An important structural aid package has been put in place to support the peace process.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;assigned to it by order of Dáil Éireann made on the 6th day of December, 1994&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;specified in relation to it in an order of Dáil Éireann made on the 6th day of December, 1994, or any other functions relating to those functions specified in relation to it in an order of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to define the committee to which the Bill relates. It is defined as being the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann while engaged in the performance of the functions assigned to it by order of Dáil Éireann made on 6 December 1994.  In addition, in that section a document is defined as including a thing which, in the context of this Bill, is intended primarily to refer to a tape, video tape, recordings or video recordings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated on Second Stage, the amendment of this section is essential because the mandate given to the committee on specific issues on 6 December terminated when its chairman reported to the Dáil.  I am aware that the report made was an interim one, but the Order assigning the functions to the committee was so phrased that the presentation of that report to the Dáil had the effect of <Col N="1040" /> discharging the committee's reponsibilities in full.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of our views on the correctness or otherwise of the Dáil initial decision, the Government accepts that an appropriate substitution for the original terms of reference is required to allow the inquiry continue.  It is essential for this section to be amended to take account of whatever action the Dáil takes in this regard.  A number of amendments put down both by the Government and the Opposition deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment No. a1 is designed to cover the committee's mandate being reactivated by the Dáil in relation to those functions assigned to it on 6 December by providing that it relates not only to those functions assigned to it by the lapsed Order but also to any other functions relating to those functions specified in any other Order of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In a brief meeting with the Whips this morning we had preliminary discussions on the possible format of the committee. I give notice that I will try to introduce a Report Stage amendment which will allow the format of the committee to be changed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment No. a1 is better than my amendment No. 1.  Will the Minister indicate if I am correct in saying that the amendment refers to future orders of the Dáil?</P>

With the agreement of the House, the words in the amendment in the names of me and Deputies O'Donnell and O'Malley, &ldquo;the text of which order is set out in the Schedule* to this Act&rdquo;, should be interposed in amendment No. a1 after the words &ldquo;December, 1994&rdquo;.  The two amendments can be happily married in those circumstances.  The amendment would then read &ldquo;specified in relation to it in an order of Dáil Éireann made on the 6th day of December, 1994, the text of which order is set out in the Schedule* to this Act, or any other functions relating to those functions specified in relation to it in an order of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from my party Whip that everyone is anxious to ensure that the provisions on the composition of the committee, its membership and the way it proceeds are as flexible as possible. <Col N="1042" /> Given that Fianna Fáil does not control the House, it is important to point out, so that it can be considered between now and Report Stage, that the committee is defined in section 1 as &ldquo;the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann while engaged in the performance of the functions...&rdquo; This definition will be amended to meet the limitations of the order imposed on the committee on 6 December last and so that when the committee next meets it will carry out its business in a more ordered way.</P>
      <P>Deputies should consider that the membership of the committee is being restricted to its present membership. Obviously it is open to the committee to order its own business and Deputies should consider whether they wish to restrict the composition of a future committee to the existing membership of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security or whether a committee should be set up to deal with the matter set out in the schedule and any other functions assigned to it.  The Whips may wish to retain some measure of flexibility for themselves in terms of the membership of the committee, and obviously this would require amendment to the Bill.</P>
      <P>If Deputies want to restrict the composition of a future investigation committee to the existing membership of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security that is fine.  I am merely pointing out that Deputies have the option of deciding whether the membership of any future committee could be decided by the parties without reference to any existing committee and this would require amendment to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is general consensus that tighter control should be exercised by the chairman over the conduct of any of the committee's functions under the Bill and there should be agreement among the parties to a provision which gives the active function of asking questions to a small group of people rather than having it diffused among all the members who <Col N="1043" /> have to raise their hands if they want to ask questions.</P>
      <P>Under the committee's terms of reference it is open to a party to substitute another person for a member and we are not tying ourselves down to any personnel by agreeing to leave the membership of the present committee to whom this task is delegated as it stands. The Minister's sensible concern that there should be flexibility in terms of membership of the committee is well and truly met by that provision.  Everybody in the House is conscious of the requirements of dignity, probity, the rule of law and the Constitution in how the affairs of the committee are conducted. One cannot have a free for all and by agreement we can achieve a balance and a proper regime under which the committee can operate, rather than by attempting to impose in advance on the committee particular methods of operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the Minister's amendment No. a1 as amended in the way proposed by Deputy McDowell.  The Minister of State referred to an amendment he proposes to put down on Report Stage.  I am somewhat puzzled about this and do not understand why he proposes to put down the amendment on Report Stage when he has just circulated a list of Committee Stage amendments.  Given that we are dealing with both Stages today, any amendment should be given to us now so that it can be considered in the context of what we are discussing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the matter stands the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is set up in accordance with the present format. I do not know whether Deputy Michael McDowell has in mind an informal arrangement between the Whips and members of that committee but such an arrangement would be highly desirable.  I take the view that the composition of the committee is too large to <Col N="1044" /> do the job efficiently in a reasonable time.  I do not know whether it is suggested that we deal with that question by way of amendment here or whether it can be done in that way.  If any such amendment is available we should have it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that a smaller number of members participate in the inquiry seems reasonable.  I chaired the Committee of Public Accounts for six years, during which time the most difficult examination we had to carry out was the Carysfort case which had difficult political implications but we got through it very well.  It was a focused inquiry.  The whole question of focus needs to be considered and agreed on by the parties.  I repeat what I said earlier, that I would like to see the relevant amendment as soon as possible so that we can have an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Much concern was expressed about the question of natural justice.  As the terms of reference of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security stand, a member can be substituted by another member of the same party. That could lead to a situation where a person who is a witness today could be a substitute member of the committee tomorrow and, therefore, could examine other witnesses who would not have the same opportunity to examine that witness.  I put that down as a question mark.  In any practical arrangement we would have to ensure that natural justice was protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to utter a word of caution in relation to what appears to be an agreement in the House, to restrict the right of Members to become involved in the committee when it is up and running.  It would be wrong of the Dáil to restrict the membership of the committee in examining or asking questions of those coming before it.  There has been such restriction in the past in relation to the order of speakers but, so far as I am aware, there has never been a question of restricting examination of <Col N="1045" /> three or four members of a committee. That would not be the correct way to proceed.</P>
      <P>We have tended to forget the net issue in all of this, that is, the seven month delay in the Smyth case.  It is important to ensure, if we are adopting the order of 6 December, that the committee have the ability to investigate the circumstances in which there was a seven month delay in dealing with the file in the Attorney General's office.  It is important to clarify whether the membership of the committee will have the right to investigate that net issue.  I realise there are other agendas in relation to politicians generally but the word should go out from here that this Parliament wants to investigate the reason for the delay in the Smyth case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this issue it is important that we have before us even a draft of the amendment proposed by the Minister which will touch on the procedures by which the committee may do its business in discharging its functions under this Bill.  That goes to the core of what we are talking about.  It is difficult to reach conclusions without knowing what the Minister intends proposing. As it stands members of the committee can be changed by a procedure of going through the Committee of Selection.  There is also a substitution procedure whereby, if on a particular day a member cannot attend, another member can stand in for them.  Under existing procedures there is provision for the attendance of Members who do not happen to be members of the committee. There is also a procedure whereby, apart from voting rights, such non-members have virtually the same rights as members of the committee.  If there are to be changes in relation to fulfilling the task described in this Bill and by order of the House of 6 December, that is fine provided there is agreement.  I raised with the Minister the question of what happens if the different parties cannot reach such agreement.  We should think ahead in <Col N="1046" /> regard to what would apply in that kind of situation, that is unless we can have agreement now on all these various issues.</P>

      <P>There are two issues here &mdash; personnel and size. Deputy Michael McDowell is correct in what he said about the right of political parties to substitute.  That handles the question of personnel but we are still left with the question of size.  There is general agreement that it will have to be a fairly small focused committee if we are to get at the truth, which is the objective of Members on all sides of the House.  I agree with Deputy Dermot Ahern that it is not appropriate to deal with this by way of amendment to the legislation, surely the committee has that power.  I am asking the Minister of State whether the select committee can select a sub-committee of itself to deal specifically with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point we should trust the committee to be able to order its own business.  The excess numbers on the committee can be modified by agreement of the party Whips.  On a cross-border basis we can agree to order our business in a dignified and civilised way, in a way which will allow us to pursue the search for the truth.  The motion passed on 6 December 1994, as in the schedule to the Bill, sets out a defined focus for the committee's business. Apart from that we should leave it to the committee and the Whips to order our business so that the immature procedures, which we saw in stark evidence last Wednesday, will be modified by us as Members of the House and allow us to proceed in a dignified manner.</P>

      <P>It is of crucial importance that we have an agreement across the floor in relation to how we proceed.  It is evident from the shambles we had here last Wednesday that we cannot have 165 practising politicians becoming self-appointed senior counsel. If we attempt to do that we will be here <Col N="1047" /> for a very long time, perhaps for years. The logical and sensible procedure is to endeavour to have the committee arrive at some arrangement to ensure precise questioning and that there are precise rules so that the entire committee will not fail in its objective.  It will fail if there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit to the Chair that what we have been discussing for the past ten minutes or so is essentially a Report Stage amendment which has been talked about by the Minister of State.  The points made by the acting Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, are valid points to be taken into consideration but they should be considered on Report Stage when the amendment is circulated to us; at the moment it has not been drafted.  We got past amendments Nos. 1 and 2; amendment No. 3 is next and we can then take the section.  Rather than get bogged down on something that should arise later, we should complete Committee Stage first by moving on to amendment No. 3, if that is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raised the matter was to get the views of Members on the conduct of the committee.  If I read correctly what has been said by Deputies Michael McDowell.  O'Donnell and others, I think we are at one. <Col N="1048" /> This matter can be decided by the committee, but I felt it necessary to raise it now so that we could get a general view from Members as to how we should conduct the business of the committee. I believe it is the view of this House that the committee, in whatever format it is eventually set up, should be very focused and that there should be a limit on the number of questioners.  This is not because anybody here wants the committee to operate in this fashion.  On Second Stage I made a statement, subsequently circulated to the Whips, giving the Attorney General's view.  He adamantly stated that if there is a repeat of the débacle at the committee meeting last Wednesday, it would get nowhere, constitutional rights would be infringed and the committee would be bogged down in litigation before getting off the ground.  My purpose in raising this matter now and discussing it with the Whips is to establish if there is consensus that the committee should be focused.  I can attempt to table an amendment on Report Stage or to summarise what we have discussed here.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, asked if the committee could form a subcommittee and I understand it can.  Other Deputies referred to restricting the rights of individuals to ask questions, which has never been the case in this House.  We never had a committee such as the one proposed and, while it is all very fine to invite people to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and others and allow them to ask questions in any order, that would not be acceptable when people's constitutional rights are in question and we would not get away with it.  The committee must be structured and focused.</P>
      <P>I will quote the Attorney General's advice on the procedures of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very idea that a Committee composed of 35 members should be entitled to question witnesses, raises <Col N="1049" /> enormous difficulties of practical importance.  I do not know whether the standing orders of the Committee limit questioning time for each member of the committee or confine them to a specific number of questions.  I do not know whether or not the members of the Committee will be allowed to make statements when asking questions.  This should be forbidden absolutely.  I do not know what sanction is available to the Chairman for a Committee member who proceeds to break such a rule.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of a Committee of such size will have an almost impossible task.  Presumably he has no punitive powers.  Can he exclude or suspend members of the Committee who misbehave and fail to obey his directions?</P>
    <P>That is only a part of the Attorney General's advice on the procedures of the Committee.  I understand Members opposite have a copy of that memorandum. It is valid that I should raise this matter to get the views of Members without tabling an amendment and if I interpret their views correctly, there is cross-party consensus that we should proceed on the basis of a much more focused committee.  If that is the case, an amendment may not be necessary, but I would like to hear Members' views in that regard.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Select Committee on Legislation and Security is getting much criticism about what happened last Wednesday.  In fairness to the committee, which has worked well under its chairman, it was the setting, in which all Members of the Dáil took part, which caused the problem. We tried to get the Members of the committee to sit in the two front rows, but that was not agreed by the Fianna Fáil Members, who were entitled to sit in their seats.  The committee was not at fault, the setting in which it was trying to do business was wrong.  Having <Col N="1050" /> regard to the manner in which the committee is being referred to, one would imagine all its members were nut cases.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;`evidence' includes the expression of an opinion, belief, intention or allegation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This definitional procedure is included in the main Bill which was prepared by a number of Governments in the past, but not introduced.  The purpose of the amendment speaks for itself.  As it stands, the wording of the Bill limits privilege to actual evidence and, in accordance with the hard legal definition of that term, would exclude privilege to the expression of an opinion, a belief, intention or allegation, which I do not believe is the intention of the Bill.  It would be safer and better to follow the main legislation in this regard which contains an extended definition of &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; covering expressions of opinion and, possibly, hearsay evidence, so that people coming before the committee to give evidence need not be concerned that expressions of belief and so on, would not be covered under the privilege provision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, any statement or answer given or made by a witness before the committee shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have been given or made while the committee is engaged in the performance of the functions</P>
      <P>(b) If a witness who is making or giving a statement or answer before the committee is directed by the chairman or the person acting as chairman of the committee to cease making the statement or giving the answer, on the grounds of irrelevance or fairness the witness shall be entitled only to qualified privilege in respect of any part of the statement or answer made or given by the witness after the giving of the direction.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> This section confers on a witness giving evidence before the committee, or furnishing evidence to it at the committee's request, similar privilege and immunity as a witness appearing before the High Court.  This provision precludes a witness or a furnisher of documents being sued in relation to the evidence or documents furnished.  The difference between this privilege and absolute privilege was mentioned on Second Stage when at least one Member sought assurances that it would not result in the Attorney General being unwilling to appear before the committee.</P>
    <P>The second element of the section is intended to meet doubts about the impact on privilege of the attendance at meetings of the committee of the public or media and provides that this will not diminish the privilege of a witness.  The third element prevents a statement made, or documents produced, to the committee being used against a person in criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Amendment 3a provides that any statement by a witness to the committee shall be deemed to have been made while the committee was carrying out the functions assigned to it on 6 December 1994.  The intention of this provision is to ensure that evidence given before any revived or new inquiry is brought unequivocally within the terms of the Bill and that privilege accorded in that connection is copperfastened.</P>
    <P>The second part of this amendment is designed to meet the danger identified on Second Stage of a witness using the privilege conferred by the Bill to make statements which, in other circumstances, would render him or her amenable to the law.  This is done by having the High Court privilege terminate once the chairman or acting chairman asks him or her to cease making statements or answering.  Members will be aware that qualified privilege is one under which a person can be sued, which leaves a witness with the defence that he or she was carrying out a duty unless it can be shown he or she was acting in a malicious manner.</P>

      <P>We received notice of this amendment a short time ago. While in theory I have no objection to the principle outlined by the Minister of State, I have some questions in regard to the manner in which this would operate. We need time to tease this out.  Perhaps it is something we should re-examine on Report Stage because it would appear we are giving the chairman or acting chairman of the committee very extensive powers.  A decision by a chairman or acting chairman as to what was or was not relevant or fair would be subjective. It would be taken on the spot, so to speak.  Perhaps we could insert a sentence or phrase reading &ldquo;the chairman or acting chairman, with the consent of the committee&rdquo;.  If the committee decided to override a decision of the chairman or acting chairman, it could do so.</P>
      <P>Some witnesses appearing before the committee will be Members of the Oireachtas while others will not.  One view is that any witness appearing before the committee has the same privilege as another but I am not entirely sure that is the case.  That is something on which I should like to obtain advice.  If the chairman or acting chairman of the committee was able to withdraw privilege, a witness in one category would be left with qualified privilege only.  A witness in another category, say a Minister, answering to the committee would be perceived to be discharging his or her duty as a Minister and therefore might have constitutional protection.</P>
      <P>I do not object to the section itself but I should like to tease out the question of qualified privilege.  If the chairman or acting chairman was able to apply qualified privilege, could he apply to a Minister, a former Minister or a Member of the Oireachtas the same privilege he would apply to an official or a stranger brought before the committee?  The second question is whether the chairman or acting chairman should have such power even if the committee did not agree with his judgment.</P>

      <P>After a few years in this House, it can be said that questions are disallowed on the grounds of &ldquo;fairness&rdquo;, which has happened to me on the odd occasion, but not on your part, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I do not see what this proposed sub-section adds to the Bill.  No material given thus far requires to be validated retrospectively in any way; nothing has been said which could possibly give rise to litigation by the only person who has yet come near this committee.  I do not believe that anything like that necessitates retrospective validation or privilege.</P>
      <P>I am not at all happy with the proposed subsection (3) (b) which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>If a witness who is making or giving a statement or answer before the committee is directed by the chairman or the person acting as chairman of the committee to cease making the statement or giving the answer, on the grounds of irrelevance or unfairness, the witness shall be entitled only to qualified privilege in respect of any part of the statement or answer made or given by the witness after the giving of the direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That subsection does not make sense. Whereas it may have made sense when the drafting process was begun, as it stands now it means that, after one has <Col N="1055" /> been given a direction, no matter what one may say, one lapses into a different form of privilege.  That appears to be the worst of all worlds.  One gets a direction to be relevant or fair and, on the basis of this provision, one goes from High Court witness privilege to having qualified privilege by reason of the fact that one has got a direction, even one with which one complies.  I cannot see how this constitutes any improvement and I suggest that it be withdrawn.  If it can be sensibly re-phrased for Report Stage let us examine it then, but in its present form it means virtually nothing to me.  If it actually means that a witness has the nature of the privilege afforded him or her decreased after a direction we should provide something to the effect that the witness would have that partial removal of protection afforded him or her only if he or she ignored the direction given by the Chair.  The amendment does not even provide that.  We would be better off without this provision. If some well drafted proposal along these lines is thought necessary to the Bill, we can deal with it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Now that we have switched over to &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;fairness&rdquo;, the point I was going to make has been taken care of.  However, I might pursue the point made by Deputy Michael McDowell.  As I see it, the chairman of the committee would issue a direction if a witness was being irrelevant or unfair.  It seems to me that a witness who was being irrelevant or unfair should not be entitled to the full High Court privilege.  What we are providing in this amendment is that if a witness does not comply with the direction, he or she will have reduced privilege but, as it were, he or she would have no loss of privilege in relation to that portion of his or her evidence which was unfair which had given rise to the need for the direction.  That is the point the Minister would need to examine. That is my worry about the drafting of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Minister's proposed subsection (3) (a) but I am somewhat puzzled about subparagraph (b) in a number of respects.  As I understand it, the privilege granted under section 2 (1) is High Court privilege which I understand to be qualified privilege, not absolute privilege.  If a witness has qualified privilege only to start with, how can it be reduced down to qualified privilege by the Minister's subsection (3) (b)?  Perhaps my interpretation of that is wrong but that is the way it strikes me.  Even if there is a difference between High Court privilege and qualified privilege &mdash; and I presume there must be since it is worded that way &mdash; I am still not happy about it because this amendment would give the chairman a judgmental judicial role in assessing what was or was not relevant and fair.  It could be that a witness might regard what he or she was saying as quite fair and appropriate but as it might have adverse consequences on another person, it should not be open to the chairman to intervene and say that the privilege to which the witness would otherwise be entitled under the section is thenceforth discontinued. The question of irrelevance or unfairness could give rise to a number of difficulties.  To give a judgmental or judicial role to the chairperson is at variance with the object of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which is a fact finding investigation.  It is to take and record the statements of anybody who has anything to contribute in so far as the issues deputed to it are concerned.  The committee's role is not to assess the veracity of those statements or to comment on them.  That type of judicial determination would be outside its role and this type of provision would not be appropriate in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms there are two types of privilege, absolute privilege and qualified privilege, but there is also what the Minister of State at the Department of Justice described <Col N="1057" /> here last week as the hybrid, the privilege given to a High Court witness.  My understanding is that absolute privilege is given to the Members of this House by the Constitution and because of that it was not possible for this House to give that privilege to others.  Accordingly, the House had to decide whether to give witnesses appearing before the committee qualified privilege or the privilege given to a witness in the High Court. Qualified privilege is for a witness who is obliged to give information to a person or body who had a duty to receive it and such evidence would have to be given without malice.  The hybrid privilege covers the evidence given by a witness in the High Court or a variation of the High Court.  A witness appearing in court is entitled to that privilege when he or she gives evidence before the court, but should that witness drift into irrelevancy he or she would no longer have any privilege.  This amendment provides that if that should occur in the course of the committee's hearings, the witness would still be protected by qualified privilege, namely, the privilege of a witness who has a duty to give evidence to a body or persons who have a duty to receive that evidence.  The terms of this amendment protect the witness in the event of him no longer being covered by the protection afforded a High Court witness.  I am sorry if that sounds convoluted and complicated but it is the position as I understand it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue's point about qualified and High Court privilege. Qualified privilege is a lower form of privilege than that afforded to High Court witnesses.  Under qualified privilege if a witness giving relevant evidence in the matter under consideration does so maliciously he or she can be caught, whereas under the privilege given to a witness who appears before the High Court, a witness can only be caught if he or she tells deliberate lies about matters extraneous to the matter before the <Col N="1058" /> court.  I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue on the need for this subsection.  Regarding what Deputy Taylor said about the chairman's role, surely the chairman must have some role in excluding matters which are irrelevant or unfair.  One of the main functions of the chairman is to prevent people wandering from the matter under consideration and making the most outrageous statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a judicial function but certain consequences can flow from it.  Deputy McDowell's interpretation on his initial reading of the subsection is incorrect.  He seems to think that if the chairman cautions a witness on evidence he has ruled out, the witness will only have qualified privilege when giving the rest of his evidence.  I do not believe that is the position.  The subsection refers to the statement or the answer, that is the statement or the answer about which he was warned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand over my interpretation.  The subsection says that the witness shall be entitled only to qualified privilege in respect of any part of the statement or answer made or given by the witness after the giving of the direction.  If a witness is told that he or she is being irrelevant or unfair and not to answer the question but continues he or she will lapse into qualified privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the remainder of the witness's statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how we should deal with the present position. As Deputy Taylor pointed out, it is clear that if the chairman gives a <Col N="1059" /> direction under this subsection and the witness does not comply with it even though he or she is trying to tell the whole truth, the witness moves from High Court witness status to qualified privilege status.  Deputy O'Donoghue fully encapsulated the distinction between the two.  The witness moves from one status to the other because the chairman has given a direction to him.</P>
      <P>That is clear and is the simple ordinary meaning of the section.  It is not appropriate that a witness's protection should depend on a ruling given by the chairman of the committee instanter or half way through a statement or answer. Regardless of how well advised is the chairman of the committee, he is not a lawyer by definition and is not in a position to suddenly withdraw a witness's privilege because he considers the witness is being irrelevant when a High Court judge might later decide the opposite and consider the remark made was highly relevant.  Deputy Taylor's objection is absolutely valid.  We do not want people to move from one category of protection to another on an instant remark made by the chairman of the committee to the effect that the witness is either being irrelevant or unfair and is required to desist on that basis.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to change people's rights at law by reference to a ruling of a chairman suddenly given when in the cool light of day a week or a month later, it may transpire that the chairman was wrong in his ruling or misunderstood the point the witness was trying to make and the witness was right and his point was relevant and fair.  Taking away somebody's protection in law based on an instant adjudication by a chairman in the course of a debate is unfair, but more to the point, it is entirely unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not need this provision.  If a witness makes a malicious statement unrelated to the matter being considered by the committee, he or she has to face the music as people regularly do in the High Court.  If a witness in the High Court loses his or her privilege by <Col N="1060" /> making an irrelevant and untrue remark about somebody else, he or she is not entitled to this new qualified privilege. Why should a witness who comes before a Dáil committee be given greater protection than a High Court witness?  A ruling of the High Court does not decide the matter and a ruling of the chair should not be decisive in an equivalent context here.</P>
    <P>The Bill set out to give witnesses the same rights as High Court witnesses. Let us forget about what happens when they are being irrelevant or are given a direction by the chairman.  That does not happen in the High Court.  If a High Court judge says to a witness: &ldquo;you are being irrelevant; this has nothing to do with the case&rdquo;, the witness would not automatically lose privilege as a result. It would be a matter for another judge on another day to decide whether such irrelevancy, unfairness or malice was involved.  What we are doing is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that Deputy Taylor's objection is correct.  By virtue of instantaneous decisions of the chairman of the committee we are depriving people of protections which they should have and which perhaps on reflection people believe they should always have.  We are giving to the chairman of the committee a very difficult role of deciding when somebody is straying into the realms of irrelevance.  The chairman is entitled to hold those views and to keep order at the meeting, but if by making a decision on irrelevance or unfairness he eliminates somebody's privilege, it is an unnecessary complication, it is unfair and puts an unnecessary burden on the chairman of whether he should intervene on the grounds of irrelevance or say nothing because he may be damaging or creating a cause of action against the witness.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor in that if this concept is to be introduced we should have a better amendment to deal with the real issue.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Dea.  It is very clear that it is the portion of the statement made by the witness after being given a direction <Col N="1061" /> that goes into the lesser category of privilege.  I do not know what the purpose of that is, but it is completely unnecessary.  It does not happen in the High Court and it is not necessary here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the argument made by Deputies Taylor and McDowell.  The current chairman would not want the difficulty foisted upon him under this amendment, that is to make decisions on the spur of the moment in circumstances where evidence is being given by a witness. However, it is important that there be some restriction or penalty on a witness who goes into the realm of unfairness or irrelevance.  We must remember that we are bestowing on non-Members who appear before the committee a very important right that must be treated with great respect, that is the privilege of a High Court witness. There must be some stricture on that person's ability to say things they might not be able to say outside the House. While I have sympathy with the argument made by Deputies Taylor and McDowell, there must be some restriction in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are purporting to give to witnesses outside this House the High Court equivalent of privilege, yet in the High Court witnesses have to take an oath.  I raised on Second Stage whether witnesses appearing before this committee would be required to take an oath to tell the truth.  That should be considered because it is possible for people to appear before the committee and not tell the truth.  Unlike the position in the High Court, witnesses before the committee who would be privileged in that respect would not have to take an oath. Perhaps that matter could be considered before Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point made by Deputy Ahern, there exists a power for the Ceann Comhairle to confer on any committee of the House the right to hear evidence under oath &mdash; I think it applies under the Oireachtas Witnesses Oaths Acts, 1924.  It was used in the past two years on the Limerick <Col N="1062" /> Markets Act.  The Ceann Comhairle can extend to a committee the right to hear evidence under oath and, as I recall, the oath is administered by the clerk of the committee.  We may wish to hear evidence under oath and it would be a matter for the Ceann Comhairle as to whether to confer on the committee a general power or a specific power at any given time.</P>
      <P>The difficulty does not arise with sub-section (3) (a) but rather with subsection (3) (b).  I have doubts about this paragraph and I would need to take advice on it.  I ask the Minister to reply to the important question I raised earlier. What is the difference between the status in terms of privilege of a Member of the Oireachtas, Minister or former Minister appearing before this committee as a witness and that of a civil servant or other person who is not a Member of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue summarised very well the different types of privilege.  On the relevant point raised by Deputy Mitchell, my understanding is that those appearing before this committee will have absolute privilege, as have Members of this House. This amendment was proposed because on Second Stage some Members raised the question of absolute privilege and at least one Member sought assurances that the difference between absolute privilege and High Court privilege would not result in the Attorney General being unwilling to appear before the committee.  That should be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address one or two other relevant points.  It is my understanding &mdash; I put this to the Whips this morning and it arose on Second Stage &mdash; that a legal adviser will have to be available to this committee.  Such a person would act in the capacity of adviser to the chairman and to the committee and defender of the constitutional rights of all people who come before the committee, be they witnesses or questioners.  In that context the chairman &mdash; some people may fear he would act in a partisan way <Col N="1063" />&mdash; would not suddenly decide that the questioning is getting tricky, that somebody will be embarrassed or that he must protect the Attorney General, a former Minister or whoever; his decision would be based on the advice from the legal adviser whose job it would be to advise him and protect the constitutional rights of Members.  The amendment should be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>As a lay person &mdash; I have heard many legal people refer to this &mdash; I read this section as being a safegaurd for witnesses appearing before the committee who are not Oireachtas Members.  I would have absolute privilege, but a witness who is not a Member of the Oireachtas and may not have much experience of the law may unwittingly stray into an area which is unfair or irrelevant.  It is not fair that the chairman, acting on advice from a legal adviser, should warn the witness that what he is saying is irrelevant or unfair? If the person concerned chooses to proceed and continue with a statement he or she should be under no illusion as to the consequences and that is what this amendment is designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy McDowell's point &mdash; I am not a legal person &mdash; but it is my clear understanding that the chairman would interrupt the witness to advise him that what he is saying is irrelevant and unfair and that if he stops at that point he will continue to have privilege. I presume that is the way it would be done.  As Deputy McDowell suggested, there might be a need for clarification but I fear that if we do not include the section non-Members of the Oireachtas will not appear before the committee because they will say that if they make a statement they will not have privilege. I ask Members to think again about this matter.</P>
    <P>If Members wish, I can retable the amendment on Report Stage &mdash; we will have to decide shortly when we will take it &mdash; exactly as it is or with a slight change in the wording but we should consider the matter very carefully.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may have touched on a possible solution to this problem.  We want to give the chairman the power, with the legal advice available to him to advise a witness that what he is saying is either irrelevant or unfair and warn him of the consequences.  This matter could be covered by the rules of procedure relating to the way in which the committee will be conducted.</P>
      <P>The problem with this amendment is that not alone would the chairman have power to advise a witness that what he is saying is irrelevant or unfair but also to prescribe a penalty.  This seems to be ridiculous in the sense that what the witness might say later may be in order, relevant and fair.  The solution might be to delete this subsection and, in the proposed rules of procedure for discussion between the parties, to give the chairman, with the advice available to him from the legal adviser, the power to warn a witness that what he is saying is irrelevant or unfair and to spell out the consequences.  Essentially, we are trying to put a witness in the same position as a witness in the High Court.</P>

      <P>Witnesses who are not Members of the Oireachtas before the tribunal will not be in the same position as High Court witnesses because some, if not all, will be, as described in the Haughey case, parties.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposal before the House, if a person is not being malicious, genuinely believes what he says and what he is saying is irrelevant, it is only right and fair that, if he continues, he should suffer some sanction following a warning.  Having reflected on this matter it strikes me there could be another difficulty.  If someone gives evidence which is irrelevant maliciously, as things stand, he will be caught before he is given a warning and if he continues in the same vein following a warning he will be protected.  That presents a difficulty and it might be wise to look at that matter again.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's statement, that if the amendment is not made to the Bill some people might be discouraged from giving evidence to the committee, puzzles me; I would have thought that the reverse was the case for the obvious reason that a person might be disinclined to appear if they know they may be tripped up, inadvertently, and lose privilege as a result of a warning given by the chairperson of the committee. If they know they may give evidence with privilege they would feel safer.</P>
      <P>If one thinks about the term &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; I have little doubt that as the work of the committee progresses witnesses will say things that many people would regard as unfair and others perfectly fair.  This is a subjective test depending on one's point of view.  It is incapable of being operated with the specified intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the way paragraph (b) is worded, as soon as a warning is given by the chairman all the remaining evidence would be given by the witness concerned with qualified privilege.  The <Col N="1066" /> amendment states &ldquo;in respect of any part of the statement or answer made or given by the witness&rdquo; to the committee. This covers the entirety of what they say to the committee.  After a couple of lines the chairperson may interrupt the witness to say that what he is saying is irrelevant and that he has to warn him in accordance with the subsection.  When this happens it seems, in regard to the remainder of the statement, the witness would lose privilege and be subject only to qualified privilege.  This could be a disadvantage to any witness who might be prepared to give evidence before the committee.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the question of having a legal adviser to the chairperson.  We will have to consider this matter very carefully to see if this would be advisable.  I have doubts about it because one would then be setting about substituting opinions on issues of relevance and fairness, not necessarily strict legal issues &mdash; we are not talking about a law case but an inquiry to establish the facts.  Would the chairperson be bound by whatever advice was given by that legal person?  The chairperson might not agree with it and might feel there was a relevance but the legal person might say there was not.  The chairperson has a difficult and onerous job and must make decisions.  It is not a question of the chairperson of the committee having no control over the affairs of the committee and the exercise of sanctions.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, subject to correction, that the chairperson of this committee, like any other committee, would be perfectly entitled simply to stop any witness talking about total and absolute irrelevancies. To say that one can continue with the irrelevancies but on a different privilege basis is not the point.  If total and complete irrelevancies are offered by a witness, the chairperson would have both the power and the duty to stop it and say it has nothing to do with what the committee is about.  If the witness continues in that vein, he or she <Col N="1067" /> will have to be asked to stand down or something to that effect.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that provided the evidence of the witness, in the course of the committee's inquiry, is relevant to the subject, he or she can speak maliciously, or without justification or from ill will and be covered by privilege.  Let us take the position of a witness who, by sheer accident, drifts into an irrelevance.  If that is done without malice he or she is covered by qualified privilege.  If, on the other hand, the witness concerned drifts into an irrelevancy or an unfair statement purely for malicious purposes, that person is clearly not covered by the qualified privilege provision.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Taylor who suggests that the witness would have lost the status of High Court privilege if the chairperson should say that the witness was being irrelevant or unfair. Clearly, the chairperson would have to be right in that judgment.  Subsequently, it would have to be established, if it was raised, that the chairperson was right and that what the witness said was irrelevant or unfair.</P>

      <P>That is my understanding of the position.  In those circumstances I wish to reiterate that the safety net of qualified privilege is essential because a witness may go off the subject and become irrelevant without malicious intent.  The entire objective of the amendment, as I read it, is to give an additional layer of protection to the witness and it is crucially important &mdash;<Col N="1068" /> and everybody wants to get to the truth of this matter &mdash; that every witness can feel protected and be in a position to tell the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The committee shall, while engaged in the functions referred to in the Schedule* to this Act, take all steps which in the opinion of the committee are necessary to protect and vindicate the good name, character <Col N="1069" /> and other constitutional rights of witnesses and other citizens.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we propose to delete section 3 and, subsequently, section 4, and substitute this amendment.  The Schedule would be changed now to section 1 because we have incorporated that Schedule into an earlier amendment of the Minister's.</P>
    <P>We believe sections 3 and 4, as presented in the Bill, are much too elaborate for the task the committee has to face.  The legal origins of these sections date back to the 1971 case <i>in re</i> Haughey.  We believe it is not necessary to set out in detail in this Bill the law as laid down in the Haughey case.  It would be difficult to disagree with the concerns expressed by the Attorney General in his memorandum to Government.  In relation to our procedures, they are not insurmountable problems and the Whips can agree to overcome those procedural difficulties.  The Attorney General also had concerns in relation to the constitutional rights of witnesses.</P>
    <P>If the Haughey rights apply, as they may, the Attorney General's view of the scope of the Haughey case is too wide. It is worth noting that the Haughey case was most unusual.  During the course of an investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts, a Garda chief superintendent made a number of serious allegations against Mr. Jock Haughey. These were about matters so central to the committee's inquiry &mdash; the expenditure of the grant-in-aid for Northern Ireland relief &mdash; that the Supreme Court held that Mr. Haughey was not simply a witness but was, in reality, in a position analogous to a defendant, at least in so far as his good name was concerned.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the Haughey case is it suggested that all witnesses before parliamentary committees are entitled to these rights.  That contention has never been made until now.  The scope of the Haughey rights are far reaching and it is worth questioning how many of the proposed witnesses to appear before the committee are in a position analogous to that of a defendant.  The rights as laid <Col N="1070" /> out in the Haughey case should be put on the record because we will have to be mindful of them when we are dealing with this matter in committee.  They are (a) a witness should be furnished with a copy of the evidence which reflected on his or her good name; (b) that he should be allowed to cross-examine by counsel his accuser or accusers; (c) that he should be allowed to give rebutting evidence and (d) that he should be permitted to address, again by counsel, the committee in his own defence.  These are the Haughey rights as laid down and they are currently the law.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted by the Attorney General, goes further than this.  Witnesses are to be given a copy of all evidence or documents, all witnesses are to be permitted legal representation, the right to cross-examine and various other rights.  Even persons who are not witnesses but who are identified in the evidence can also join in the proceedings for the purposes of the later section 4.</P>
    <P>We believe our amendment will give the committee sufficient direction and will accord to any person who is in a position analogous to that of a defendant all the rights guaranteed to him or her in the Constitution and all the procedural facilities necessary to assert them.  Sections 3 and 4 are far too elaborate. We should be able to trust the committee.  With the assistance of legal advice, for the chairman, as proposed by the Government Whip, to allow him supervise and perhaps exclude matters under the advice of a lawyer, we can guarantee that those rights will be protected. There is no need to lay down in sections 3 and 4 the detailed statement of the law as in the Haughey case.</P>

      <P>If I had brought a Bill like this before the House last Tuesday I would have had no difficulty in accepting what Deputy O'Donnell said but my memory is not that short.  I was in the House and saw what happened here last Wednesday which, as I said previously, was a disgrace to Members collectively and to the profession of politics.  I make no apology for saying <Col N="1071" /> that.  What I saw last week would not allow me in conscience &mdash; on the basis of whatever agreements may be made and I hope an agreement will be made &mdash; to put a Bill through the House that did not copperfasten the constitutional rights of every citizen.  I have no objection to accepting the amendment as worded, subject to the provision that section 3 and other relevant sections remain.  I would be happy to accept the amendment as a double indemnification that Members realise there are constitutional rights that must be protected.  If the Progressive Democrats Party is prepared to allow the specific spelling out of those rights in the Bill by amending its proposal, I will have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage debate Deputy O'Malley referred to the Constitution and the constitutional position and if I am not misinterpreting him I think he said that the Constitution afforded too much protection in this area.  It is our Constitution and I will not be a party to diminishing anybody's constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>I will accept the amendment subject to the deletion I mentioned, which would leave section 3 as is, and I want sections 4 and 5 included so that those constitutional rights can be clearly specified.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept section 3 as drafted because it requires the committee to carry out certain things at the behest of a witness.  As I said on Second Stage, I do not think it would be right for this House to empower a witness to require a parliamentary committee to do something. We would be giving that witness more power than the committee and I set out a number of amendments, Nos. 7 to 17 inclusive, all of which I have agreed to withdraw.  If this amendment is passed it will not be necessary to amend section 3 as acceptance of this amendment involves its deletion.  I support that and <Col N="1072" /> on that basis I agreed to withdraw my amendments.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the House heard Deputy O'Donnell say that she wanted to substitute &ldquo;person&rdquo; for &ldquo;citizens&rdquo;.  I think &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; would be too narrow a definition.  I took advice on this matter from an eminent senior counsel and I will read an extract from his advice:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the Constitution, it seems to me that it is not necessary to have an absolute entitlement in witnesses, either to deal with matters in the manner contemplated in Section 3, or to be dealt with by the Committee in the manner suggested in Section 4. There obviously are circumstances where a person will have to be afforded certain rights, or the procedures may fail to comply with the rules of constitutional justice. However, that does not mean that in every case a request of a witness needs to be acceded to.  I, therefore, believe that the best way of dealing with this is to confer in each case a discretion upon the Committee.  In order to ensure that that discretion is properly exercised, it would be helpful, in my view, if a sub-section were included, which provided that the Committee was obliged to accede to such a request unless it was satisfied that it was unnecessary in the interests of justice to so accede.  There is a principle of constitutional interpretation known normally by reference to the &ldquo;East Donegal Co-op&rdquo; case, in which it was first clearly set out, which states that the Courts will assume that other constitutional organs (most normally the Oireacthas) will, in exercising any rights which they have, comply with provisions of the Constitution.  Therefore, provided the Section requires the Committee to consider the interests of justice, the Courts will assume that the Committee will make any decision in a proper fashion, and will not permit someone to have the <Col N="1073" /> proceedings of the Committee damage them without giving them a proper chance to be heard.</P>
    <P>From what the eminent counsel I consulted said, the following sentence: &ldquo;Therefore, provided the Section requires the Committee to consider the interests of justice....&rdquo; is covered by the amendment in the name of Deputies O'Donnell, O'Malley and McDowell and, accordingly, I support it.  I do not support the section to which I proposed an amendment which I have now withdrawn. It is quite clear, particularly from counsel's opinion attached to the special report of the Committee of Public Accounts from which I quoted on Second Stage &mdash; PL5645, May 1988, that the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts in 1971, which were challenged in the Haughey case, were valid except for one section referred to already by Deputy O'Donnell.  Rather than inserting meandering, unnecessary sections I think a general principle of this kind, when it is adhered to by the committee and in particular by the chairman, well and truly covers us against the concerns expressed in the Haughey case.  I have no doubt this amendment is the best way to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the section. It is important to enumerate in legislation how the Dáil wants to proceed in examining witnesses in this committee. This Bill is purely and simply about this committee only and the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Donnell and others is too bald.  It is open to interpretation &mdash; and indeed misinterpretation &mdash; and perhaps just as in the Haughey case where he found it necessary to go to court to try to find out exactly what his constitutional rights were at that stage it may very well be necessary for us under this amendment to close up shop temporarily so that the High Court, or indeed the Supreme Court, could give a ruling on this issue.  It is far better to enumerate matters in the Bill so that witnesses coming before it would know for certain the procedure to be <Col N="1074" /> adopted and how their constitutional rights would be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>Will there be a difficulty, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Haughey principles in giving a potential witness a statement of other witnesses' evidence in advance of them appearing before the committee?  Under section 3 (1) (c), apparently the first witness will be entitled to a statement of evidence by other witnesses appearing before the committee.  There is an onus on the committee, even before any witnesses appear, to have statements taken from witnesses and given to people in advance of their appearing before the committee.</P>
      <P>It is important that we take issues one by one, know the allegations clearly and list them so that people coming before the committee know what they must refer to.  This must be given to them in advance of their coming before the committee.</P>
      <P>I support the section.  It is important to enumerate and list the rights and duties of witnesses but there is a procedural problem.  Last week the committee was hung up on procedural matters and I would not like to see another débacle.  Under this section, the first witness to appear will be entitled to advance notice of what other witnesses are about to say.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 encompasses all the rights of a witness or another person.  Nothing is excluded. It insists that the committee take all steps necessary in its opinion to protect and vindicate the good name, character and other constitutional rights of witnesses and other persons.  Setting out the rights <i>in extenso</i> as in sections 3 and 4 does not confer any additional rights on a witness or other person.  The Constitution takes precedence over any law and if a Bill tried to cut down on anyone's constitutional rights, it would be nugatory.  A person has rights anyway and cannot be denied them.  They can be vindicated in the High Court if necessary.  Therefore amendment No. 6 is adequate to cover the entirety of the rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> The rights set out <i>in extenso</i> in sections 3 and 4 are unnecessary because amendment No. 6 grants all those rights plus anything that is left out of sections 3 and 4.  Sections 3 and 4 go beyond what is laid down in this respect in the three cases which are relevant &mdash; Haughey 1971, Goodman No. 1 and Goodman No. 2, 1991.  The other distinction is that it is assumed that every witness who comes before the committee will stand in the same position <i>visà-vis</i> the committee as Mr. P. Haughey stood <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Committee of Public Accounts in 1971.  That is not so.  Mr. Haughey was found by the Supreme Court to stand in the position of a defendant before that committee and that is why he was given certain rights such as having statements of evidence produced to him beforehand to enable him to cross-examine.  That will not arise in this case.</P>
    <P>This committee will not come to any conclusions.  It does not have to make a report.  It simply wants to hear the evidence that will be given by the people who come before it.  It is a political rather than a legal matter and the public at large can make up their own minds on the basis of the evidence that is given.  Every right is protected by amendment No. 6 and it avoids the excessive prolixity of sections 3 and 4 and the purported giving of rights which are inappropriate to witnesses who are not accused of anything and in respect of whom certain of the Haughey rights, if we can call them that, are not relevant.</P>
    <P>For that reason the House should accept amendment No. 6 and let us get on with the matter.  Nobody is deprived of anything as a result of accepting the amendment.  Every right to which a person is entitled, whether a witness or another person, is guaranteed by this amendment in a neat and clean fashion and it will avoid the committee getting bogged down in legalities, which it undoubtedly will if sections 3 and 4 stand unaltered.</P>

      <P>As we tease out this Bill it is becoming increasingly clear that we are in considerable difficulty not only on this but other amendments.  It calls into question the adequacy of the entire procedure.</P>
      <P>If we delete section 3, will the Bill be constitutionally unsound?  I have not received any convincing answer to that question.  I understand the motivation behind putting down this amendment.  It seems that the mechanics of the section would make the inquiry too unwieldy and lead to an unduly lengthy inquiry.  I understand the concern which has been expressed on that front.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell seems to be paranoid about the degree of power we would confer on those who are not Dáil Members.  On Second Stage he almost spat out the words &ldquo;civil servants&rdquo;.  He became very worried that civil servants could dictate to the committee.  He interpreted the spirit of the section is wrongly.  The spirit of the section is more in the context of protecting people's constitutional rights.  The difficulty with the amendment is that it states: &ldquo;will take all steps which, in the opinion of the committee, are necessary to protect and vindicate...&rdquo;.  Is it the committee's prerogative to determine the constitutional rights of any witness or person who comes before it?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said he did not expect the committee would reach any conclusions or issue a report.  The public must ask what we are all going through. What is the purpose of all this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if we are not in a position to arrive at some consensus in terms of conclusions or issue some report?  Deputy O'Malley stated this was more a political than a legal inquiry. The reality is that it is in between.  It is quasi-judicial.  The history of British select parliamentary committees of inquiry is an unfortunate one which has not had much success.  Deputy Ahern made the point that people would like <Col N="1077" /> to know why there was a seven-month delay in the Smyth case.  Now we hear that we will not reach any conclusions on that important issue.  We are taking a path which could lead us down an unconstitutional road.  It is a pity that we have been forced into this situation by time constraints and the circumstances which arose in recent weeks.  This very important legislation will, no doubt, act as a precedent for the introduction of similar legislation in future and may influence the behaviour of Parliament on such matters.  I question whether we are dealing with the legislation with undue haste and making decisions which may ultimately be proved incorrect, particularly in terms of the constitutionality of the Bill.  I say this as someone who wants to get the truth as quickly as possible.  However, I increasingly question the adequacy of this procedure as a vehicle for getting at the truth.  There must be a better and easier alternative.</P>

      <P>As I said on Second Stage, there are a number of major difficulties with section 3.  I tabled amendments to try to improve that position and I think the Minister also put down an amendment in this respect.  The first dealt with the provision which gives a witness the right to require the committee to summon the attendance of any other person or specified persons to give evidence to it.  The other key point related to the necessity of giving written statements in advance before any witness gave evidence to the committee.  If those measures had stood, the work of the committee would have been rendered completely and totally ineffectual and the committee would never have had the ability to get off the ground in any practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley that the purpose of the committee is to take statements, to give the people concerned an opportunity to say what happened in detail and, in so far as there may be gaps in the statement they make to the committee, to enable a group of persons, either the entire committee, or, <Col N="1078" /> by agreement, a lesser number of people, to ask questions to fill those gaps.  I fail to understand how giving a person, who has been deputed to come to the committee to give an account and record of the events, the opportunity to see by way of statements in advance what other people said can influence their account of the events of which they have personal knowledge and of which only they can know.  For those reasons there should not be any need to provide them with statements in advance as to what the evidence of other people would be.  They know their story and facts and will outline them. There will be a report by the Committee consisting of an amalgam of the statements taken and the questions asked.  I do not envisage that the committee will make value judgments as to the veracity of a statement between one witness and another but it will recall and make searching inquiries into all the facts and evidence within the knowledge of each person coming before it.</P>
    <P>It would be much more satisfactory to adopt the broad simple procedure envisaged in amendment No. 6, which the Labour Party will support.  This amendment will give witnesses the necessary protection to ensure they are not unfairly taken advantage of.  The committee must form its opinion based on the evidence.  It has a job to do as to what is right and proper in that regard, it is part of its function, and I have little doubt that the combined resources and thoughts of the Members of the committee will be well able to ensure fair play and a vindication of the constitutional rights of the witnesses coming before it.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise two technical points with Deputy O'Donnell and her co-signatories to amendment No. 6 which they should address before the amendment is agreed.  I do not like the use of the word &ldquo;citizens&rdquo;, it is an inappropriate word.  The word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; should be used instead.</P>

      <P>We all want the Bill to be workable and constitutional.  Central to the question of constitutionality is the protection of the rights of witnesses before the committee.  One can adopt one of two approaches: first, the broad approach, encompassed in the Progressive Democrats' amendment, or, second, the particular approach where one specifies, as provided in the Bill, those rights and the broad approach is the proper one.  Deputy Martin questioned whether the broad approach is constitutional, it specifically provides that whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure that the constitutional rights of witnesses are protected.  It is difficult to see how there could be any validity in the criticism that the broad approach is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the same does not apply in regard to what I would refer to as the particular approach outlined in the Bill. The first danger with the approach is that one may omit some constitutional right, the danger of omission.  We are entering into unchartered waters with the committee and we are not sure what type of situation may present itself in future.  We cannot be certain that we will have covered by way of particular rights everything that may arise before the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other danger is that by being over particular we may tie up the committee in legal knots.  It is already obvious from section 3 that this is so.  A witness who wanted to be difficult could be advised to drive the proverbial coach-and-four through section 3 as it is drafted at present.  Section 3 provides <Col N="1080" /> that a witness before the committee may, in person or through a legal representative, require the committee to request the attendance of specified persons and to request the appropriate persons to produce or send specified documents to it.  It also provides that the committee shall comply with such a requirement.  A person who wanted to impede the work of the committee could be advised to request the chairman of the committee to require the attendance of, say, President Yeltsin, on the spurious case that he was a witness before a similar committee in Russia, or President Clinton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Government is precisely to avoid tying ourselves up in legal knots.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, has outlined our position clearly.  It is clear that the Opposition parties will vote down sections 3 and 4.  Certainly we will not support that.  In case the Bill ends up in the courts I would remind them of some of the advices we have received from our chief law officer on this matter and in that context people would be advised to reconsider before deleting sections 3 and 4.  These advices are available to other Whips.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned cases such as Haughey 1971, Goodman No. 1 and Goodman No. 2 but omitted to mention Garvey and a couple of others in which the principles of constitutional justice have been clearly laid down.  I would remind him to keep an eye on those when seeking to delete sections 3 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure all Deputies that everyone will intend to vindicate his good name and reputation in this House and if they cannot through the committee, they may have to elsewhere.  That is not our wish, and certainly not mine, I am capable of vindicating my good name anywhere. When people talk about the narrow and the broad approaches &mdash; as did Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; I ask them to keep in mind the basic issues here for Members like me.  At the end of the day <Col N="1082" /> when I walk away from here all I have is my good name which I intend to protect and I will take whatever steps are available to me to protect it.  I make no apologies to anyone for doing that.</P>
    <P>Constitutionality is an important issue about which we should not be flippant. To accommodate everyone's point of view on it we have been seeking to incorporate the Progressive Democrats' amendment into the Bill to ensure strict compliance with the constitutional justice principles.  The House should be aware of the advice available to us on sections 3 and 4 which were not put in for any flippant purpose.  The Attorney General, in his advices, points out that including these sections makes it clear that parties likely to be adversely affected by statements made by witnesses before the committee will enjoy all procedural safeguards.  The Attorney General pointed out that while the position may not be entirely without doubt, in the event that the committee conducted its proceedings in such a way that there was not underlying strict compliance with the rules of constitutional justice, a question mark could be placed over the entire proceedings.  The Attorney General states that we could not rule out the possibility of a person who considers himself or herself adversely affected by the failure of the committee to comply with such rules, having recourse to the courts for appropriate relief.  Obviously the courts would have to think carefully before granting injunctive relief in respect of the proceedings of a Dáil committee.  However, if the manner of conducting those proceedings was such as not to provide adequate protection for the strict constitutional rights of witnesses to their good name the courts would be prepared to intervene.  This factor should also be taken into account in considering the desirability of proceeding in the way proposed.</P>
    <P>In the interests of everyone in the House, this committee should meet the <Col N="1083" /> strict constitutional requirements of every citizen and I would caution people who will make statements which will affect a person's good name and reputation that these people can have recourse to the courts.  That may be necessary depending on how the proceedings are conducted.  It is clear that prudence and caution should dictate the view of the Oireachtas as we tread on totally new ground.  Never before has such a committee been set up.  It is not for the purposes of obfuscation that sections 3 and 4 are being inserted, but on the strict advice of the chief legal law officer of the State to ensure strict compliance of which none of us should be afraid.  We should ensure that this legislation gives explicit assurance that we will conduct these proceedings in accordance with the law.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey said, an implicit guarantee, based on what I saw here last week, is not sufficient.  I understand Opposition members' point of view but given the need to ensure that the presumption of constitutionality cannot be challenged during the proceedings of the committee, one should be wary of deleting sections 3 and 4 in case the proceedings of the committee are not in strict compliance with constitutional justice.  Others have also made that point.</P>
    <P>On the issue of constitutionality, we are aware of the difficulties in setting up this type of committee.  That there is no compellability provision gives rise to concern from the constitutional point of view.  In the absence of a compellability provision, witnesses acting in good faith could be prejudiced and it must be expected that the committee will expressly declare its rejection of evidence, which would be incomplete evidence, given by a witness who refused to co-operate or submit to cross-examination. While the position is not entirely without doubt, it is hoped that the adoption of such an approach by the <Col N="1084" /> committee would save the Bill from a declaration of infirmity on constitutional grounds, should such a course of action be adopted by any person.</P>
    <P>A factor that should also be taken into account is that the committee is not required under its standing orders to make findings or deliver a verdict on the evidence before it.  Clearly, whether on the issue of individual constitutional rights, the question of compellability, the need to work, the wish of the House to bring forward this Bill to deal with special circumstances, outstanding questions remain.</P>
    <P>While everyone is anxious to establish the committee to deal with the uncertainty, I hope judgment will be suspended until all the evidence is heard when we can come to our own conclusions one way or the other.  On the legal advice available to the Government the deletion of sections 3 and 4 could lead to problems if there is not strict compliance with constitutional rights.  This is not something we should leave to chance.  We should warn everybody by explicit reference to it.  The lack of a compellability provision also leaves one open to certain possible problems which can be dealt with if procedures are adopted by the committee which will ensure that incomplete evidence is rejected because of non-appearance or refusal to be cross-examined.  Those in the legal profession and others in the House are aware of these issues.  They must be taken on board to ensure that in setting up this new type of committee we do not adopt a prudent and cautious approach for the purpose of protecting this procedure for other matters with which the House may have to deal in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about compellability.  The absence of compellability may trammel the committee in what it does, but by the same token, it is clear from the Government's amendments that it does <Col N="1085" /> not propose to deal with this issue. Warning us about its implications runs both ways in the context of the present argument and we will have to leave it in that form.  If we go down the road of dealing with the issue of compellability, we would be dealing with the constitutional rights of others.  If the committee were set up to make findings of fact and to produce a report stating whether my evidence &mdash; if I were a witness &mdash; was credible, and to adjudicate on the credibility of people's evidence and thereby impugn their characters, all the points that were made would have greater force than at present.</P>
      <P>No Member on this side of the House is setting at nought, reducing or diluting the importance of constitutional procedures in a case such as this.  We are trying to put in place a formula which is workable and committed to people's constitutional rights.  This amendment is designed to achieve a workable committee and faithfulness to our constitutional requirements and it does so in a more flexible and appropriate manner than the provisions of section 3 and 4 of the Bill as drafted.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that Deputy Martin stated this might be a precedent for other occasions.  I am deeply concerned about that.  If this Bill is a precedent for the procedures of other committees of this House, we should be very careful about putting in place provisions which we know in our hearts are unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Attorney General advised the Government that the various judgments referred to require that natural justice be applied and that in the context of allegations people be given a right to defend themselves and a right of advance warning of allegations made about them.  Does the Minister, Deputy Cowen, seriously believe that any court or tribunal has ever functioned under the regime set out in section 3?  Has any court, tribunal or inquiry in the history of the State operated under the rubric <Col N="1086" /> that a witness can demand legal representation, make submissions and require other witnesses to appear before it?  Has any person ever suggested in any other context that a witness, great or small, has such a right?  It did not apply in the case of the beef tribunal nor is it stated in the Tribunal of Inquiries (Evidence) Act.  It is not imposed on the courts, on the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Rent Tribunal or other tribunals set up to make adjudications, which this body will not have to do. There is no precedent in Irish law which states that everybody is entitled to bring lawyers and to tell an inquiry who should be brought before it.  It is nonsense to make the proposals in section 3 so wide-ranging.  There is a duty to act constitutionally and the four rules adverted to by Deputy O'Donnell must apply to a person who is not only a witness, but whose witness character is transformed to quasi-defendant or quasi-accused.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to anticipate what will happen at the committee, but Members of the House &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, being one of them &mdash; have said they believe they are on the wrong end of a witch-hunt.  On Second Stage I indicated to the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, that I knew nothing to his detriment and I have heard nothing thus far which has convinced me of anything to his detriment. Nevertheless, if it were the case that the character or good name of a Member of this House or anybody else was brought into question because of what somebody else said, they would be constitutionally entitled to the four elements of protection to which Deputy O'Donnell referred.  However, it cannot be claimed every witness would be a quasi-defendant or a quasi-accused and that this is the only safe way to deal with an inquiry.  If that is the precedent for this inquiry, God knows what will happen at the Committee of Public Accounts, when it investigates financial frauds and <Col N="1087" /> so on, if all witnesses presume they can bring lawyers and demand that other witnesses appear before the committee to corroborate their evidence.</P>
    <P>I note the proposal to insert the word &ldquo;request&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;requirement&rdquo; in section 2, but if section 3 is operated as it stands witnesses appearing before the committee would have much greater powers than the committee itself.  They could dictate the order of appearance in which witnesses should attend, the issues with which the committee should deal and cross-examine along the lines they consider relevant, even if such matters are of no interest to the committee.  A flexible formula is the correct way of the committee to proceed. We do not have to remind it that there is case law and constitutional requirements covering this matter and if a person appears before it in a quasi-defendant or quasi-accused position they must be dealt with in a different manner from that of a witness who, say, merely states he or she brought a letter from the Attorney General to the Taoiseach at 2.35 p.m. on a particular afternoon. How could such a person claim legal representation and want to cross-examine those who handed him or her the letter or who were in the room when the letter was delivered?  How could a committee function if it was forced to make available people to be cross-examined by witnesses regardless of the relevance, centrality, obscurity or peripherality of such people's testimony?</P>
    <P>This matter requires flexibility.  Such a requirement is not imposed on the courts, it was not imposed on the beef tribunal; no tribunal functioning under our law has such a blanket requirement imposed on it.  I have not heard of the establishment of an inquiry in circumstances in which a witness could demand the presence of another witness.  This is a radical new proposal which was not implicit in the Haughey decision or subsequent case law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I ask Fianna Fáil speakers, who were concerned that by deleting sections 3 or 4 the Bill would become unconstitutional, to consider the proposed new section 3.  How could one go to the High Court and say that a committee directed by this House to apply the constitutional law as laid down by the courts in all its dealings with every witness and all other people is unconstitutional because the committee may not do so by any standard of presumption of constitutionality of an Act and of constitutionality in favour of the other organs of State.  The courts owe this House some respect in the same way as we owe them respect? How could any court say that it is to be presumed that a committee of the Oireachtas will trample down rights especially in the context of a legal provision which requires them to faithfully and scrupulously uphold every constitutional right?</P>
    <P>Of course, in certain circumstances, if an allegation is made the person against whom it is made, is entitled to know who made it and the evidence on which that person will rely.  The curious thing about this committee is that, as was the case, in the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, we do not have people to take statements from witnesses.  We cannot call on Mr. Fitzsimons, the Attorney General and say we would like to know what he will be saying in evidence the day after tomorrow to this committee.  If he is in conflict with Deputy Cowen I, as a Member of this committee, will not be in a position to ask Deputy Cowen to give me a full account of what he intends saying which may be detrimental to the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be practical about this.  Section 3 imposes on a group of people, who are only Members of this House, the obligation to take statements, formulate allegations, then put them to other people for their consideration. We are not in a position to know what happened.  We are not in a position to demand of Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Cowen or anybody else that they come here and furnish a preliminary statement so that we can ascertain whether they all match.  We are not in the position of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, which was a most peculiar one, of compiling a book of allegations.  Must we sift through all the conflicting comments we have heard in recent weeks, put them in tabular form and say we want to put this to one person and that to another person?  This is not what we are about.  We are not in a position to take statements in advance.  It would be great if people would furnish us with statements but we cannot rely on everybody doing that. For instance, we do not know what Deputy Dempsey might say to the committee. We are certainly not asking him to write out in advance, present to the committee, and give the new Attorney General, a copy of what he proposes to say and <i>vice versa</i>; it cannot be that complicated a procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had had the immunities the Attorney General required and could have assured him on the day, nobody <Col N="1090" /> would have said to stop as he did not know in advance what a witness would say in Dáil Éireann.  Nobody would want him silenced until he had received a written account of what he was going to say.  That is not on.  What is proposed in the new section 3 is not merely adequate but essential.  The original sections 3 and 4 were not adequate, were grotesque in their possible application and impractical.  These may be famous last words but the Bill would be more constitutional containing section 3, as proposed by Deputy O'Donnell, than it would be with these attempts at an elaboration of what the law requires, if I may say so without being disrespectful to anybody, rather clumsy attempts to set out what is in the law.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to avoid particularity, to tell this committee to be scrupulously faithful to constitutional requirements and natural justice, to the obligation to protect everybody, be they Members of this House or those who are not Members, and their constitutional rights.  If the committee does that, operates sensibly and in a civilised manner, it will be able to get on with its work.  Were we to accept the existing sections 3 and 4 the committee, on the contrary, will not get on with its work, and will become bogged down.  It is clear from section 3 that the first thing the committee would have to do is send out investigators to take statements from people.  In such circumstances it is doubtful that the Attorney General would start furnishing statements to one Member of this committee, acting as a kind of roving policeman, to build up a book of evidence and it is doubtful that one could distil allegations therefrom. In that context it is doubtful that one would comply with the provisions of section 3.  There is a danger that people nobody had heard of would, in accordance with section 4, be demanding to be heard and, in those circumstances, demanding that other people be called as witnesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> I ask Fianna Fáil members to accept that what we want is a short, practical and expeditious inquiry.  It can be done in accordance with the Constitution and it does not have to be turned into a mini-tribunal.  The committee will be sensitive to what the law requires of it and does not need a rather ham-fisted exposition of the law in the manner set out in sections 3 and 4 in order to carry out its functions.  Indeed if they were spancelled with sections 3 and 4 as proposed they will never report that to this House.  Presumably the report of the committee to the House will point to what happened, pass no judgement and say it is up to everybody to pass their own judgement as to what they conclude from the facts.</P>

Compellability will have to be considered in the future when we deal with this in a more detailed manner.</P>

The courts decided in the Haughey and Goodman cases Nos. 1 and 2 that a witness before a tribunal of inquiry is entitled to certain constitutional protections if, in the words of then Chief Justice Ó Dalaigh, they become a party to the proceedings. Chief Justice Ó Dalaigh stated:</P>

It might depend on their evidence or on the evidence of other people.  I am endeavouring to convey to the House that the committee will be in a good position to know because its Members will be considering the matter and preparing the report.  We are giving the committee power to decide who has and who gets these rights. People will have to accept that as being a very reasonable approach.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that in <i>re</i> Haughey case the facts were different in that Mr. Jock Haughey was almost in the nature of a defendant and that, as a result of the report the Committee of Public Accounts, Mr. Haughey could have been criminally prosecuted; the same thing applied in the Goodman case. While they may have been the facts of those cases, the reality is that the judgments of the courts in those cases said something entirely different.  The judgments in the Haughey and Goodman Nos. 1 and 2 cases, and in other cases to which Deputy O'Malley did not refer, as I understand it, were that a person has a numerated constitutional right to vindicate his or her good name if it is impugned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh in his judgment in the Haughey case <Col N="1094" /> stated; &ldquo;whereas here it is considered necessary to grant immunity to witnesses appearing before a tribunal then a person whose conduct is impugned as part of the subject matter of the inquiry must be afforded a reasonable means of defending himself.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;reasonable means&rdquo; to which he adverted was that he agreed with counsel's submission on the four protections mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell.  The word &ldquo;impugned&rdquo; is wide-ranging.  It does not necessarily mean that a person would be open to criminal prosecution, it could mean simply that their good name would be defamed.  We should not imagine things because the consequences for Mr. Haughey and others might be different from those for some of the witnesses who appear before this committee of inquiry.  The protection to be given to witnesses, such as members of political parties, who appear before the committee should not be any less than that which applied in other cases.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Donnell is in accordance with the Constitution.  If legislation is introduced which states that people will get their constitutional rights, that is in accordance with the Constitution but who will decide people's constitutional rights?  Will it be the committee?</P>

      <P>I can read what the Supreme Court ruled and legislation can be drafted on that basis.  That is a much <Col N="1095" /> better approach than leaving the investigation to a committee when we do not know what it will come up with. Deputies McDowell, McManus, Taylor and I all have a similar wish in this regard, that the matter moves forward as quickly as possible and dealt with in the least cumbersome way.  Nevertheless, if we go along these lines and have something general, standing on its own as proposed by the Progressive Democrats, we might never reach a conclusion because I foresee constant referrals to the courts.  If Deputies McDowell and O'Malley consider that the rights of witnesses, such as members of political parties, in this case are something less than the rights given to Mr. Haughey in that case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley seemed to suggest that although I accept that Deputy McDowell did not.  Let us spell out those lesser rights, otherwise we will flounder in a sea of uncertainty.  The Government amendments meet the case made by Deputy McDowell because the committee will know who will be affected, whose conduct will be the subject of the committee's consideration and what witnesses will fall into that category.</P>

      <P>The committee was obliged to allow those witnesses to look for whatever statements they wanted initially.  Now the committee is being given that discretion and it is best suited to decide that.  I would prefer the committee to decide those matters which are peculiarly within its knowledge instead of deciding what form of constitutional protection should be given to potential witnesses who are members of parties here if that protection is less than the <Col N="1096" /> protection outlined by the Supreme Court in the Haughey case.</P>

      <P>The amendment regarding requirement does not enhance the Bill because the concern I expressed on Second Stage &mdash; and continue to express &mdash; relates to section 3 (1) (ii) where a person may require the committee to request the attendance of specified persons and require the committee to request the appropriate person to produce certain specified documents to it.  That section enumerates many other points.  As I said on Second Stage, it is absurd that any witness should have the right to require a parliamentary committee to do what that person wishes.  That is not only unconstitutional, it is undemocratic.  I put down a marker in respect of that section on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Minister Cowen mentioned the Attorney General's advice as law agent and I also read out the legal advice of an eminent senior counsel who is an expert on constitutional matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  We should put both cases on the record. Part of the senior counsel's advice was: &ldquo;therefore provided the section requires the committee to consider the interests of justice, the courts will assume that the committee will make any decision in a proper fashion and will not permit someone to have the proceedings of the committee damaged without giving them a proper chance to be heard&rdquo;. That is well and truly covered by this amendment.  I was so concerned that, following the advice, I was told that if I tabled a number of additional amendments to those I had already tabled they <Col N="1097" /> would improve matters.  In section 3 eight of the 11 amendments are in my name and in section 4 nine of the 11 amendments are in my name.  I tabled 17 amendments to those two sections to bring them in line with what is constitutional, fair and reasonable.  Far from this being a good section and not being open to challenge, on advice I received I have seen 17 areas in those sections which need amendment before the Bill passes this stage, Report Stage or goes to the Seanad.  There seems to be an underlying suggestion that Members of the House would go to court to vindicate their rights, that is their right.  If any witness who appears before the committee feels that his or her constitutional rights are impugned, the witness is free to go to court.  I put down the marker that I doubt if the courts would put up with the type of arguments made in this House.  The courts would decide the matter based on the law and on what is fair and reasonable.  Witnesses should take that into account before they go to court and incur costs.</P>

      <P>Based on the advice the Deputies who tabled the amendment and I received, this amendment meets the requirements admirably.  I do not know if anything further needs to be said on this section.  I support this amendment and the deletion of section 3 because it will give greater protection to witnesses.  I do not consider that any of the concerns expressed in that regard are borne out.  The argument here strongly favours the new amendment tabled by Deputies O'Donnell, O'Malley and McDowell, the withdrawal of my amendments and sections 3 and 4.</P>

I cannot embellish what has been said by my two legal colleagues but I reiterate that our desire in accepting the Progressive Democrats' <Col N="1099" /> amendment and requesting that sections 3 and 4 remain in the Bill is to make absolutely sure that people are aware of their constitutional rights and to set out procedures the committee can follow to ensure those rights are vindicated.  If the Bill is amended as proposed, those constitutional rights will not be spelt out. My party will not agree with that and will register its dissent if it is put to a vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the new section 3 inserted by <Col N="1106" /> Committee Stage amendment No. 6, to delete &ldquo;, while engaged in the functions referred to in <i>section 1</i> of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 4, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1) The Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the committee&rdquo;) may appoint a subcommittee consisting of such members of the committee as it may determine.</P>
      <P>2.  A subcommittee appointed under <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section shall, if so requested by the committee, perform the functions referred to in <i>section 1</i> of this Act in lieu of their being performed by the committee; and, in relation to the performance of those functions by such a subcommittee, this Act shall apply and have effect with the modification that references in this Act (other than <i>section 1</i>) to the committee shall be construed as references to that subcommittee and with any other necessary modifications.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will recall that earlier in the debate we discussed the possibility of setting up a subcommittee so that the inquiry can be more focused.  The amendment propose that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the committee&rdquo;) may appoint a subcommittee consisting of such members of the committee as it may determine.  That subcommittee will be given the right to continue on an investigation as if the full committee were pursuing it.  This is a reasonable way to proceed and it will help to achieve what we <Col N="1107" /> all desire, to focus the committee, get it working and tighten its procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of the amendment concerns me, namely, &ldquo;and with any other necessary modifications.&rdquo; Will the Minister expand on precisely what is meant by that term? This is a good amendment and I will be supporting it but I have one concern about it.  As I explained on Committee Stage &mdash; I believe my recollection on this is correct &mdash; the Oireachtas Witnesses Oaths Act, 1924 allows the Ceann Comhairle to confer on committees of the House the right to hear witnesses under oath.  My understanding is that a witness who is found to have given evidence under oath which is incorrect is liable to be treated in the same way as if that person were in a court.  In other words, it would be a criminal offence of perjury.  I am not suggesting that any witness would want to do that but I am suggesting that the committee may wish to ask the Ceann Comhairle to confer such powers on it for the purposes of its examination.  If I recall correctly, a committee took that course of action in recent years on a relatively innocuous Bill.</P>
      <P>If the committee wishes to examine any witness under oath and is given that power by the Ceann Comhairle, whom I understand is empowered to do so, would that power extend to a subcommittee of the committee?  In other words, if the committee allows a sub-committee to carry out an examination on behalf of the committee, would that subcommittee have all the powers of a committee?  If the Ceann Comhairle would confer powers to hear evidence under oath, would that power transfer to the subcommittee also?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the thrust of this amendment.  As I said on Committee Stage, for this operation to be effective, it is necessary and essential to have a smaller grouping which can deal with this matter in a much more effective, controlled and expeditious manner. <Col N="1108" /> I would like the assurance of the Minister, in so far as he can give it, that the composition of the subcommittee would be <i>pro rata</i> party wise to the composition of the committee.  I would like confirmation also that the subcommittee will sit in public and otherwise will conduct its affairs like the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some observations on this amendment.  In principle I agree with the amendment but some points occur to me.  The definition of &ldquo;committee&rdquo; is in section 1.  I raised that with the Minister of State during the interval and he felt it was necessary to redefine it because of the fact that it is delegating its functions under section 5.  I am not sure I understand that.  If it were not necessary to redefine it, the words &ldquo;Select&rdquo; and &ldquo;on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (in this section referred to as `the committee')&rdquo; could be deleted because &ldquo;the committee&rdquo; is already defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words, &ldquo;and with any other necessary modifications&rdquo; seem to be very wide.  I suggested substituting the words &ldquo;<i>mutatis mutandis</i>&rdquo;, which have a particular meaning and which would not be as wide as &ldquo;and with any other necessary modifications&rdquo;.  I understand the Minister of State's advice is that the phrase &ldquo;<i>mutatis mutandis</i>&rdquo; should be avoided and I then made the alternative suggestion, which I hope will be accepted, that it should read, &ldquo;and with any other necessary and consequential modifications&rdquo;, in other words to insert the words &ldquo;and consequential&rdquo; after &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  Without this, the modifications could, I think, be very wide and that is not appropriate.  Subsection 2 states: &ldquo;A subcommittee appointed.... shall, if so requested by the committee, perform the functions....&rdquo; Is it necessary to put in a phrase such as &ldquo;shall be empowered to perform and shall perform&rdquo; or is the phrase &ldquo;shall perform the functions&rdquo; sufficient to confer all the powers and duties of the committee on <Col N="1109" /> to the subcommittee?  I do not want somebody to challenge the subcommittee afterwards by saying that there was not a full delegation to it or there was not power for a full delegation.  I ask that the words &ldquo;and consequential&rdquo; be put in on the second last line.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, replies to those various points I wish to query something Deputy Gay Mitchell said.  Deputy Mitchell raised the matter of the oath but it seems that the only implication of administering an oath is that if somebody lies under oath he can subsequently be prosecuted for perjury. As I understand section 2(3) any statement or admission made by a person before the committee will not be admissible as evidence in any criminal proceedings.  If the oath is administered it may be necessary to amend that position to say &ldquo;except in relation to proceedings for perjury&rdquo; or some words of that nature.</P>

      <P>The Government amendment No. 1 states:</P>
      <P>The Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the committee&rdquo; may appoint a subcommittee consisting of such members of the committee as it may determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee Stage debate was very constructive.  From listening to Members' contributions I think there is a perception that if a special committee or subcommittee is to be set up to deal with this matter it should include Members with a legal background.  My reason for raising this matter is that if membership of the subcommittee is to be confined to the members of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security it may exclude others who would have a valid claim to be on the subcommittee.  We should make available the facility of substitute members. <Col N="1110" /> On the basis that the subcommittee comprises of 12 members representative of the various groups it would mean that for the smaller groupings only one of its members would be entitled to be on the subcommittee and could be tied up for weeks on it.  I think it would be necessary to have a facility to appoint designated substitutes and perhaps we should consider also allowing Members who are not members of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to serve on the subcommittee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain fully the relationship between the subcommittee and the committee?  In most people's eyes a sub-committee is a lesser body than the parent body.  We would have to be satisfied that they were of equal standing and had equal authority.</P>
      <P>The issue of substitutes does not present a problem for the committees as that is written into the regulations governing them.  Is it the case that, even though it is not written into this amendment, the issue of substitutes will not present a problem later?  Will the Minister clarify this?</P>

      <P>I had raised on Committee Stage the question now raised by Deputy Kenny.  The only practical solution is by way of the Committee of Selection.  It is fair to say that this will be the most important work that this committee will do in the immediate future and therefore it will be open to all parties to reconstitute their membership of the committee and select the people who they believe will best contribute to it and they can do this by means of the Committee of Selection. Thereafter there will be sufficient members to arrange substitutes if the Standing Orders of the committee arrange for this when setting up this subcommittee.  The practical solution to the problem is to maintain maximum <Col N="1111" /> flexibility and participation by those whom each party would like to see involved and to use the Committee of Selection to reconstitute the Select Committee on Legislation and Security if so required.  When the committee sets up its subcommittee it will ensure that the provision of designated substitutes will be part of the Standing Orders of the subcommittee.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage when this matter was raised we agreed that this might be the practical solution to the problem. It was the unanimous view of those participating on Committee Stage.  I see precisely the point Deputy Enda Kenny raises.  On the question of empowering the committee we have accepted as a basic principle that a committee can order its own business.  That being the case, a committee can delegate the performance of its duties and functions to a subcommittee.  I do not think there can be a problem about the dilution of competence passing from a committee to a subcommittee.  It is fair enough to raise the point but common sense dictates that if a committee can order its own business it can order a subcommittee to do the business of the committee in a specific matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy O'Malley of providing for too wide a modification I think the committee will decide on that at the end of the day.  The <Col N="1112" /> committee will have a majority to ensure that is the case and from a practical point of view I do not think there will be such modifications of its duties as to cause a problem.</P>

Perhaps if I tie it in with my other comments on substitutes the matter can be teased out further.  Under the existing rules of procedure, substitutes may attend a committee or a subcommittee thereof and those substitutes may not necessarily by members of the committee.

      <P>We are talking about legislation to give a specific committee serious work to do.  Can Members imagine a Member attending a committee meeting and then making three substitutions in a morning in order to attend a county council or other meeting? Some committees have problems getting a quorum.  I caution against the subcommittee having the right to nominate substitutes.  There should be continuity of membership on the committee otherwise substitute Members who may not hear the evidence could ask a range of separate questions.  We want to avoid that.  We are talking about setting up a structure to give legislative effect to a subcommittee of the main committee and we should reflect further on the question of substitutes to the subcommittee. It could cause problems.</P>

      <P>I am extremely anxious to get at the truth of this matter and have a trenchant attitude in that regard.  Irrespective of the mechanism used I want the truth to emerge. However, it is important to state that there is every chance the President will refer this Bill to the Supreme Court.  In deference to Article 40 of the Constitution, and to the powers of this House to confer privilege on witnesses, it might be considered to be an ouster of the jurisdiction of the court and the Bill may well be found to be unconstitutional. I hope that does not happen.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowen suggested that the absence of compellability might imperil the constitutionality of the Bill.  No Member brought forward any proposal to insert a compellability provision into the Bill.  If the Bill were found to be flawed by the absence of such compellability provisions &mdash; I do not see how it can but, perhaps, Deputy Cowen is right &mdash; it will not be because of the rejection of any proposal on compellability that it will be found so wanting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I am making the point that it will not be because any provision was rejected.  The courts administer justice and this House is part of Parliament.  Parliament is not merely a legislature, it is a house of representatives. Part of our function as representatives is, on occasion, to make inquiries for ourselves and not rely on the courts to determine facts or on the Executive to supply us with advice but for us to make up our own minds, especially when it relates to whether the <Col N="1115" /> House was or was not misinformed on certain matters.  It is part of the integral nature of a Parliament in a democracy and of a house of representatives in such a Parliament that it has powers to carry out inquiries.  Inquiry is not a function which is the monopoly of the courts.  The House should not be shy about taking to itself its constitutional rights to inquire into matters and satisfy ourselves as public representatives entitled to come to our own conclusions one way or the other on the matter.</P>
      <P>The report of this committee will not be one in which anyone will be adjudicated to have misbehaved or otherwise. Neither the committee, nor any subcommittee, is entitled under its terms of reference to evaluate the evidence, reject it or come to any verdict or conclusion about it.  That is a matter for Members of the House and the public when they see what emerges in the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the latter part of Deputy McDowell's contribution. In the negotiations for the illfated resumption of the Labour-Fianna Fáil partnership Government, I drafted a section dealing with committees such as this.  I have no fears about extending the powers of the House and it having an inquiring role.  I agree with the Deputy on that.</P>
      <P>The Bill is unusual in many respects, not least the constitutional aspects referred to by many speakers.  There was all-party agreement that this was the Bill, more or less, which should be brought forward.</P>
      <P>The issue of compellability has been examined for 16 years.  We are aware of the difficulties involved.  We are a caretaker Government and had we introduced such a provision it would have fundamentally altered the Bill.  That is why we did not insert it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike other Deputies who spoke I am not a lawyer.  My view of the Constitution is that this House can regulate its <Col N="1116" /> own business.  This is a committee of the House and everything mentioned by various speakers can be met under the Constitution.  I may be wrong but as a lay person and a Member of the House I would like to believe we can do so and go ahead on that basis.</P>
    <P>The following phrase is at the end of the amendment: &ldquo;with any other necessary modifications&rdquo;.  I do not know if Deputy O'Malley wants to insist on including &ldquo;consequential&rdquo;.  My advice is that it is not necessary and does not add anything to the Bill.  However, if Members want to insert it, I have no difficulty doing so.  The other necessary modifications relate to the composition of the committee, etc.  In other words, we will do our own business; the law will provide the framework and we will decide the specific structures.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the phrase &ldquo;shall perform&rdquo;.  My advice is that the phrase is sufficient and that the subcommittee will have the same rights as the full committee.  Deputy Taylor asked about the composition of the committee.  This is a matter for further discussion.  At the Whips' meeting this morning Deputy Kenny said that a committee of 12 members would ensure that the proportionality of the House was respected.  It was also felt by the Whips &mdash; this matter will also have to be discussed, and Deputy O'Donnell referred to it &mdash; that, in line with the advice we got from the Attorney General, there should be one questioner per group on the committee for each witness.  This would allow for some movement of personnel. It is necessary that the subcommittee is as confined and focused as possible.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted this House, the Whips and, if necessary, others will be able to modify the procedures for the subcommittee and bring forward new procedures.  We will regulate our own affairs in that respect.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Minister for Finance may provide for the payment, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by a person in respect of the appearance of the person, in person or by a legal representative, before the committee or the giving of evidence, or the production or sending of a document, by the person to the committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government is proposing that section 5, as initiated, should be restored to the Bill.  This is in deference to the views expressed on Second Stage. The substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is a small but significant amendment.  The section, as amended, will now read:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may provide for the payment, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by a person in respect of the appearance of the person, in person or by a legal representative, before the committee or the giving of evidence, or the production or sending of a document by the person to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise that this power will be discretionary and will relate only to reasonable costs.  This amendment is rooted in the fundamental principle that <Col N="1118" /> any measure enacted into law by the Houses of the Oireachtas should not tread on the constitutional rights of any citizen.  We should not abandon section 5 which was devised to protect the rights of witnesses and others.

      <P>I referred earlier to the Oireachtas Witnesses Oaths Act, 1924.  This one page Act states:</P>

      <P>(2)  Any Committee of either House of the Oireachtas, and any Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas, may administer an oath to a witness examined before such Committee.</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;Any person examined as aforesaid who wilfully gives false evidence shall be liable to the penalties of perjury.</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;Any oath under this Act may be administered by the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann or the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann or by such other person or persons as may be appointed for that purpose by them or by either of them, or by any Standing Order or other order of either House of the Oireachtas or by any Standing Order made by the Houses of the Oireachtas jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.&mdash;This Act may be cited as the <Col N="1119" /> Oireachtas Witnesses Oaths Act, 1924.</P>
    <P>We should be aware that the Ceann Comhairle has this power.  For the reasons I outlined on Committee Stage, it is not necessary to accept the Minister's amendment and I will oppose it.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of the amended section 5 in the Bill is a test of the assurances by Members that they will fully respect our constitutional rights and be mindful of them during the proceedings of the committee.  This is not a tribunal but I am sure that during tribunals some people felt their good name was being challenged and legitimately took all necessary steps to vindicate it.  This was done at the taxpayers' expense and in some cases it amounted to £1 million.  That is fair enough and I have no problem with it.  It was for the chairman of the tribunal to make that decision and he rightly made it in favour of everyone who wished to take up that offer.</P>
      <P>As I said, this will not be a tribunal but the same principle applies.  It has been said that almost all the people involved are public servants and that they should have no problem attending the committee.  I do not intend to spend too much money at the taxpayers' expense in maintaining my good name and integrity.  This depends on how the committee behaves towards me and whether my integrity is impugned.  If, as I have been assured, my <i>in re</i> Haughey rights will be respected, I do not see why I have to do this but if it comes to it there is no problem.  I am told that the minimum protection available to me as a citizen, quite apart from that available to me as a public representative, in respect of allegations made against me are set out in <i>in re</i> Haughey, one of which is that I will be allowed to cross-examine by counsel the accuser or accusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told not to worry, that <Col N="1120" /> there is no question of anyone being put in the place of a defendant or being regarded as a party to the proceedings. I do not know who has given out the tablets for collective amnesia in regard to last week's events but the number of accusations made were phenomenal.  It was as mad a frenzy as I have seen in a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is simple.  It is that basic courtesy be extended from colleague to colleague in respect of my right, if necessary, to be cross-examined by my accuser or accusers and my right to be permitted to address the committee in my own defence.  If it is being suggested that the reasonable cost of vindicating my right is too great a burden on this House, I can make my own arrangements.  That is not the point &mdash; there is a principle involved here.  If it is felt by a majority in the House that that is unreasonable, this amendment can be voted down, as the previous amendment was on Committee Stage.  I appeal to Members' sense of justice, if they have any, and urge them to reconsider that point.  If they do not wish to consider it, I will do without it and I am sure many others will also.  It is indicative of the attitude which sometimes comes to the fore despite one's best efforts to hide it that your sense of fair play&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of courtesy.  It is a matter of the fundamental nature of a committee of this House.  We will fundamentally change the nature of inquiries before this House if we accord a new system of legal aid and if it becomes the norm for barristers and solicitors to attend on behalf of people who feel their reputations are imperilled and who know that by bringing barristers and solicitors here they will be able to look to the public purse to reimburse them.  In the amendment the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is inserted instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but I cannot understand how that changes anything.  If the new Minister for Finance is given power to give costs to persons how is he to <Col N="1122" /> exercise that power and how is he to distinguish between witnesses?  There is no guidance given to him in the legislation. I believe the courts would interpret the world &ldquo;may&rdquo; as &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and require them to deliver costs to everybody or to nobody and certainly would not allow him to distinguish between one person and another.  It is not a question of generosity, it is a question of the nature of the proceedings of this House.  The proposition that Members of this House should come before the House with lawyers when asked questions about the performance of their functions as Ministers is undesirable to say the least and we should lean against it, in so far as we can, within the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out there are two decided cases &mdash; Security <i>v.</i> Ireland and Condon <i>v.</i> CIE &mdash; in which the courts have indicated that the rights of people to use lawyers and advocates to protect their good name and their property rights under the Constitution do not carry with them a concomitant right to have legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has not suggested that.  There are many people who get no costs when they go before an employment appeals tribunal or a rent tribunal.  We should not forget that there are many people who, due to the absence of public funds, get no effective legal aid for up to six or eight months in our legal aid centres. People have to provide their own legal representation in many spheres of life, without the right to costs.  It is not a matter of being niggardly, trampling down rights or trying to subvert rights. If we establish a system of payment of costs and if we give to the Minister the discretion which the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would imply, it would have to be exercised consistently and by reference to some <Col N="1123" /> rational criterion and inevitably everybody would have costs awarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for public servants who come before this House to look to this House for costs.  If a public servant by virtue of his or her public duties as a civil servant is summoned before the House and it is reasonable and necessary for them under the Constitution to bring their own representatives, they can look to their employer, the State.  We are really talking about politicians here.  With the greatest of respect, when the day comes that politicians require representation to deal with each other it will be a sad day for democracy.</P>
