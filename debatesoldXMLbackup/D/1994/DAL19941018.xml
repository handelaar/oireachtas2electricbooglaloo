      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has for a comprehensive review of the Constitution in view of the fact that it is almost sixty years since the Constitution was drawn up and having regard to the social and political changes since then; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans for a general review of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>There is a referendum on divorce in prospect, as indicated in the Programme for Government.  The proposal in that regard is being prepared by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who will bring it before the House as soon as the Supreme Court Case on the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation Act is concluded.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, in view of the various challenges to the Constitution and the fact that it is almost 60 years since it was put in place and some time since there was a review of the Constitution as the basic <Col N="2046" /> law document of the State, that it is time to carry out a general review, particularly in relation to Articles 1, 2 and 3 and the sections which deal with the rights of women in society?  Will he agree that those areas need urgent attention and that a Dáil committee should carry out such a review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that the Government does not have any plans to carry out a general review of the Constitution in relation to the area of the family law programme.  We set out an extensive family law programme in the Programme for Government and we are following it up with the Family Law Bill, the Maintenance Bill, the Civil Legal Aid Bill and the Domestic Relations (Protection of Persons) Bill.  On the general review question of the Constitution, we do not have any plans in relation to Articles 2 and 3 which are the subject of discussion in the context of the framework document.  That is a matter for another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what is contained in the Programme for Government, but it would be better to carry out a general review of the Constitution in tandem with whatever work is being carried out at present so that the many anomalies, the contradicting and conflicting decisions made in respect of the rights of the family and of women and the mess in respect of the abortion issue could be addressed.  It would make sense for the House to decide to have a general review of the Constitution to bring us into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with many of Deputy De Rossa's comments in relation to the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; to which he referred.  The Government is proceeding with its legislative programme.  Of course, it is always open to anyone to challenge the constitutionality of any legislation proposed to be enacted by the Government.  That right is there and will always be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Taoiseach's <Col N="2047" /> attention to Article 28 of the Constitution which requires the Government to act as a collective authority.  Will he agree that it is a breach of collective authority and of the spirit of Article 28.4.2º for members of the Cabinet to leak Cabinet proceedings to the press and for its members to make public proposals in respect of matters that will be brought before the Cabinet at a later stage.  In regard to Article 28.6.1º which refers to the functions of the Tánaiste, which include acting for the Taoiseach when he is absent for any reason, will he agree that if that constitutional provision is to be abided by there should at least be a minimal measure of diary co-ordination between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to ensure that one or other is in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Bruton said in relation to the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach having to be in the country at the same time.  They have often been absent at the same time.  Consequently, that is a matter for ourselves in respect of the overall management of the Government and the economy.  On the question of what is confidential in relation to Cabinet meetings, that has been spelt out loud and clear by everybody and is the subject matter of a Supreme Court decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy De Rossa said about the role the Constitution assigns to women in society.  It perceives them merely as <Col N="2049" /> wives and mothers.  Single women have no role under the Constitution.  In view of the commitments made in the Downing Street Declaration, will the Government examine those aspects of our laws and of Irish life generally which are an obstacle to reconciliation?  Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be timely to establish a committee of this House to look at the 1937 Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the family is accorded a central role in the Constitution as the cornerstone of society, and 1994 is the Year of the Family, could we not agree to have a debate on all aspects of the relevant article of the Constitution to see if we are fulfilling our duties and obligations to the family which plays a pivotal role in society?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider proposals to separate the two functions of the Attorney General as legal officer to the Government and defender of the public interest into two distinct and separate offices in view of the possibility that conflicts of interest between the two roles could arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated previously that I am not aware of any instance where a conflict of interest has arisen between the various functions of the Attorney General which has created any difficulty in practice over the years. The possibility that such a conflict might arise at some time in the future is not sufficiently real to justify making any alteration in the present arrangements and, accordingly, it is not proposed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that during the beef tribunal the Attorney General refused to accept his responsibility to defend the public interest and his counsel declared on his behalf that he was only there to defend the State and State agencies and that it fell to the tribunal to protect the public interest?  Does he not regard that as a conflict between his role as adviser to Government on the one hand and, on the other, defender of the public interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation referred to by Deputy De Rossa was resolved at the beef tribunal, as he knows only too well.  The chairman of the beef tribunal accepted that there was a shared responsibility to protect the public interest on the part of the tribunal, which had its own counsel in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not tally with the facts.  Will the Taoiseach not now agree, given that I have pointed out to him a clear conflict of interest that has already arisen, that serious consideration should be given to the separation of these two functions?  Enough concern has been generated about the findings of that tribunal without having this added concern when it is clearly within the power of this Government to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's argument presumes that the Government would have an interest other than the public interest and I do not accept that for one moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the 1987-89 Government did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Attorney General is of a quasi-judicial nature, taking account of all interests and deciding his actions or advice accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his first answer the Taoiseach acknowledged that there could be occasions when the political <Col N="2052" /> interest of the Government and the interests of an individual who required to have his or her rights vindicated in public could differ.  In those circumstances surely there is potential for conflict of interest where one person is acting as legal adviser to the Government and is also acting on behalf of an individual who wants to assert or vindicate his or her rights.  Is it not the case that the Taoiseach's first answer amounts to saying that there is no perception at the moment of such a conflict of interest but that it will be addressed if it occurs?  If there is such a conflict of interests would it not be far too late to address the issue when somebody's rights are being prejudiced by the fact that the same person is supposed to represent the Government and also the private constitutional rights of the individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McDowell accurately heard what I said but I will repeat for his information that the possibility that such a conflict might arise at some time in the future is not sufficiently real to justify making the alteration suggested by the Deputy. Consequently the present arrangement stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the record of the House should read that the chairman of the tribunal decided, having regard to the instructions given by the Attorney General to his counsel that they would not defend the public interest, that it was incumbent on the tribunal to do so? Does the Taoiseach recall that it was the Attorney General who initiated what has become known as the Cabinet confidentiality decision behind which the Taoiseach and other Minister could shelter?  Was that in the public interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not forget the time limit.  The Taoiseach is deliberately ignoring an example of how a conflict of interest has arisen between the two roles of the Attorney General in the case of the beef tribunal.  That is basis enough for a change.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that and stop pretending that this did not happen or trying to distort the reality of what happened at the tribunal in his own interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there would be an advantage to all of us in having an office-holder whose job it is to vindicate public constitutional rights, in view of the fact that at present the only way a constitutional issue can be tested is if some individual is prepared to risk £10,000 or more to go all the way to the Supreme Court? Will he agree there should be a public officer whose job is to ensure that everybody, including the Government, respects the Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 107 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 June 1994, when I last provided details of my travel abroad, I have made a further eight visits.  The cost of official visits are to a very significant extent met by the host countries.  The <Col N="2055" /> charge to my Department for the visits is estimated at £85,000.  I consider that extracting the detailed figures as requested would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Throughout the periods when I was abroad, I remained in charge of and in direct contact with my Department at all times.  In accordance with long-standing practice, it was not necessary to assign my duties and functions during my absence to another member of the Government.  In accordance with established practice the details of individual future engagements are announced as they arise.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning of my period as Taoiseach I took a firm decision to work with people of Irish extraction, especially in the US, but also in other countries to gain their support in carrying through the objectives of Government both politically and economically. I believe their support is crucial to achieving success on the two key objectives of this Government, peace on the island of Ireland and substantial increases in employment and reductions in unemployment.  Opposition spokes-people show little appreciation for these objectives when they criticise such visits for short term and narrow political advantage.</P>
    <P>I stated when I took office that I intended, with my Ministers, to promote increased trade, expand inward tourism and to encourage international investment in Ireland by actively seeking and addressing potential investors, on a personal basis where necessary.  Getting foreign businesses to set up here cannot be achieved by a small peripheral nation like ours by simply sitting at home and waiting for the world to knock on our door.  I make no apology for pursuing this strategy and I intend to continue to do so in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is disingenuous in pretending that the purpose of the question is to prevent him from travelling abroad.  We would all like to see him go abroad as often as <Col N="2056" /> he thinks worthwhile, but it is not good practice to be absent from the State when the Tánaiste and indeed the President are also absent.  Will the Taoiseach indicate how often the position has arisen and how long it has continued where both he and the Tánaiste have been absent, and who has been nominated in those circumstances to be responsible for Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not assign my official duties to any Minister; when I am abroad I am in contact with my Department daily, sometimes nightly. The number of times this has arisen is a separate question and I do not have the details here, but it happens very rarely and not for very long periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is referred to in the question.  The Taoiseach will not escape that easily.  My question specifically refers to the practice of being absent when the Tánaiste is also out of the country.  How often has this occurred since the inception of the Government and for how many days or weeks?  I remind the Taoiseach that one of the Ministers, Deputy Woods, indicated on radio that he was in charge while the Taoiseach and Tánaiste were away &mdash; the Minister for Finance and I do not know how many other Ministers were also absent on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to take from the good work done by Deputy Woods as a member of Government.  As the Deputy knows quite well, that has not happened very often.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach deplore the mirth of the Tánaiste and his Cabinet colleagues at the notion of the Minister, Deputy Woods, being in charge?  Why did the Taoiseach not reply to my question about the details of visits since 12 January 1993?  In the prudent administration of the affairs of this country it is occasionally proper and necessary that the Taoiseach is out of the country, but does he agree that the extent, number and frequency of visits <Col N="2057" /> in which he has engaged is bringing politics into disrepute?  The Taoiseach cannot advance arguments about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not an abuse of public funds that the Taoiseach should engage in visits and use the Government jet, the primary purpose of which is to attend fund-raising functions for Fianna Fáil, particularly in the United States?  Does he intend to resort to this same method of travel at the expense of the taxpayer in his visit on 4 November, which was referred to last Saturday by one of his favourite columnists in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Ms Phelan?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

We will leave it to the people to make up their minds as to who is right and who is wrong in this regard.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Rabbitte that I should take a trip to Australia and New Zealand without breaking the journey in Hong Kong on the way and in Hawaii on the way back &mdash; I did useful business in Hong Kong.  I know of no person who would travel to the other side of the world without taking 48 hours off before holding a meeting.  I certainly did not have the opportunity to take 48 hours off, the most I had was 36 hours.  However, that is the subject of a later question and I will not deprive Deputies of the opportunity to question me on it.  Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate that trips to Brussels are certainly no enjoyment for any Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody objects to the Taoiseach going on worthwhile trips abroad but we would have imagined that when there was a crisis in the Government he would return.  The Taoiseach said the cost to his Department of official visits is £85,000.  What is the cost to the Exchequer of all his trips, including the cost to the Department of Defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Harney is getting at.  The question was answered in the normal manner and we have given the cost involved. <Col N="2059" /> The Deputy knows that the Government jet is on a separate account, that of the Department of Defence.  That has always been the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it is good practice and consistent with ethics in Government for him to attend Fianna Fáil Party fund-raisers while in the United States at the taxpayers' expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear, and I repeat for the information of Deputy Bruton and Deputy Rabbitte, that when I am abroad, if I have the opportunity at night after my business is done I am free to go wherever I like and see whoever I like, whether friends of Fianna Fáil in the United States or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>On the question of the forthcoming fund raising event in New York on 4 November to which Deputy Rabbitte has referred, the Government jet will not be used.  It has been made abundantly clear that where the exclusive purpose of a trip abroad is to raise funds for my party, as in the case of my trip to London and of my visit to New York on 4 November, the Fianna Fáil Party will meet the cost.  When abroad on other business in the past on two or three occasions I availed of the opportunity to meet friends of Fianna Fáil and on two occasions to attend functions, and I reserve the right to do so. Deputies opposite should not engage in this nonsense and try to make people believe that the Government jet is used by Fianna Fáil for its own purposes.  It is not and never has been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Another one of these doctorates the Taoiseach is so pleased to receive?  Does the Taoiseach agree &mdash; I hope the Tánaiste is listening &mdash; that it is unfair that a Government party is able to gain access to Government transport on official business to raise funds?  Other parties are unable to raise funds in this way as they do not have access to Government transport.  This matter should be dealt with in the Electoral Bill so as to ensure fairness between all parties in the matter of international fund raising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which is now entering its fourth year, has been a matter of major concern for the Government, the European Union, the United Nations and the wider international community.  In recent months there have been a number of positive developments.</P>
      <P>In Croatia the ceasefire agreement of last March is holding and life there is returning to normal.  Work is continuing within the framework of the international Conference, co-chaired by the European Union and the United Nations, on confidence building measures between the Croatian Government and the Croatian Serb leaders, and on an overall settlement.</P>
      <P>In Bosnia the war between Bosnian Croat forces and the Government ended in March with the signature of the Washington Agreements by the Government of Bosnia, the representative of the Bosnian Croats and the President of Croatia.  These agreements provided for the establishment of a federation in the territories of the Bosnian Muslim and Croat peoples and for a possible confederal arrangement between this federation and Croatia.</P>
      <P>The agreements set out detailed arrangements on human rights, the division of governmental responsibilities, the structure of the federation, the operation of the judiciary and the conduct of the federation's international relations.  Decisions on the constitutional status of Serb areas were left to negotiations in the international conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was clear, however, that the agreements could not fully come into effect while the key question of territorial delimitation remained unresolved. When the parties themselves were <Col N="2063" /> unable to reach agreement on this the Contact Group &mdash; consisting of the UN, the EU, the US and Russia &mdash; made proposals on 6 July for the allocation of territory between the Croat-Muslim Federation and the Bosnian Serbs.  This proposal was based on the following principls: the territorial division agreed earlier by all three parties &mdash; 51 per cent for the Croat and Muslim communities and 49 per cent for the Bosnian Serbs; the preservation of Bosnia as a single Union within its internationally recognised borders; the continuation of Bosnia's international legal personality; and the right of refugees and displaced persons to return freely to their homes of origin.</P>
    <P>The Contact Group's proposal has been approved by the UN Security Council.  It has been accepted by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, but has been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs.  The major challenge now is to bring about acceptance of the plan by the Bosnian Serbs and the international community has taken several steps to this end.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council has recently imposed a comprehensive package of measures on the Bosnian Serbs to isolate them politically and economically.</P>
    <P>In addition the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which itself has accepted the plan has decided to end its political and military support for the Bosnian Serbs. Belgrade has closed its border with the Bosnian Serb territories and has agreed that the closure can be monitored by a mission under the auspices of the international conference.  Ireland is contributing four personnel to this mission.  In recognition of this significant change of position by the authorities in Belgrade the UN Security Council has decided to suspend some of the sanctions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>A successful outcome to the peace process in Bosnia &mdash; vital to an overall settlement in former Yugoslavia &mdash; is by no means assured, but the pressure is mounting on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Contact Group's plan.  This would enable the detailed constitutional <Col N="2064" /> issues to be addressed in earnest, with some prospect of success, and would give new impetus to the search for an overall settlement in former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Is he aware that the policy of ethnic cleansing is being continued in Bosnia, that Bosnian Muslims are being driven from the places in which they are living and that by the time the Contact Group's plan is implemented the process of ethnic cleansing will be complete?  Instead of going along wholeheartedly with the Contact Group's plan, would the Minister give some consideration to the Washington Agreement which led to peace between Bosnia and Croatia and which would allow the borders of Bosnia to remain unaltered and a loose canton-style government to be put in place? Why is the Government not considering this agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read a number of recent articles, I can appreciate the Deputy's concerns.  The Contact Group's plan is a vital first step in preserving Bosnia as a single union within its internationally recognised borders. This plan has been accepted by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats but, unfortunately, not by the Bosnian Serbs. When the Bosnian Serbs accept the plan it is intended that it will form part of a settlement which will provide for constitutional arrangements to establish a relationship between the Croat-Muslim Federation and the Bosnian Serbs.  The Contact Group has indicated its firm support for a settlement under which refugees and displaced persons will be able to return freely to their homes of origin.  It is absolutely essential that an overall settlement should include such provisions.  Given the brutal and widespread ethnic cleansing in Bosnia during the past two and a half years I am under no illusions about the fears that many displaced persons will ultimately have when they contemplate returning to their homes.  It is vital when the Bosnian Serbs accept the territorial plan that <Col N="2065" /> provision be made in an overall settlement to ensure that all displaced persons will be able to return freely to their homes.  Strict guarantees, which will have to be rigorously implemented, will be necessary in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he supports the principle that people have the right to return to where they formerly lived.  Is he aware that many people have had their homes appropriated by the Serbs and that the Muslims will not be able to reclaim them?  Does the Contact Group have proposals to ensure that the principle of the right of return is implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There has to be agreement on the key territorial issues in the first instance and then there will be some prospect of preserving Bosnia within its internationally recognised borders.  That would lead to the prospect of all dispossed persons returning to their homes.  That cannot happen unless in the first instance we get acceptance of the territorial divide.  It is important that we do not view the Washington Agreements as an alternative to the Contact Group's plans.  The Washington Agreements which cover the constitutional arrangement for the Croat Muslim Federation are not an alternative to the Contact Group's plans.  The Bosnian Government has accepted the Contact Group's plan for what it is &mdash; an attempt to facilitate agreement by the parties on the limitations of the Croat Muslim Federation and on the Bosnian-Serb entity. Obviously the Contact Group will do everything possible within its remit and the international community will help to guarantee the prospect of displaced persons returning to what were previously their homes.</P>

      <Quest>asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the assurances he gave to Dáil Éireann on 1 June 1994, in reply to supplementary questions at columns 1021 and 1023 to the effect that there would have to be a permanent cessation of violence and verification of the handing over of arms before Sinn Féin would be allowed to participate in talks with the constitutional parties or in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, if this is still the Government's position following the declaration of a cessation of violence by the Provisional IRA on 31 August 1994; and, if not, the reason therefor. [</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated to the Dáil on 1 June that the definitive abandonment of the use or support of violence for political ends would open the way to participation in political talks and to a role in the shaping of an agreed future for the Irish people, and that it was also a pre-condition for participation in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I also stated on 1 June that the manner in which a permanent end to violence could be established and verified, and the other practical consequences of a permanent cessation of violence, would be matters for decision at a later stage in the light of the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 June, there has been a dramatic and unprecedented change of circumstances, due to the IRA ceasefire of 31 August and the ceasefire called by the loyalist paramilitaries on 13 October.  We on this island now have an <Col N="2067" /> unparalleled opportunity to advance the process of accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland and to construct the just and lasting peace that the people in both parts of the island yearn for.</P>
    <P>The disposal of arms by republican and by loyalist paramlitaries is a very important issue which must be addressed in detail in further discussions.  We must ensure that the bomb and the bullet are, quite literally, eliminated for ever from Irish politics.  The new situation created by the double cessation of violence offers the most promising possible starting-point to begin to address this objective.  I believe it is now right to build on this new situation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to enter into detail on the obvious logical and other difficulties on both sides.  I would hope, however, they would become progressively easier to resolve as confidence grows and the climate of peace becomes consolidated.  That objective will be enhanced by a comprehensive process of political dialogue.</P>
    <P>I believe such dialogue is urgently called for, and that it would be wrong to refuse it on the grounds that this new situation has not produced, as yet, all the elements, including disposal of weapons, which we all agree are a necessary component of any lasting peace.  A satisfactory resolution of this issue will be one of the goals of the dialogue we wish to see in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from that reply that the Government's position has in fact changed quite dramatically, to use the Minister's own phrase, since 1 June.  Does he recall on that occasion &mdash; as reported in columns 1021 and 1023, of the Official Report of 1 June &mdash; Deputy Michael McDowell twice asking him, assuming a ceasefire, if there would be talks with any party or organisation that declined to give up its arms? Twice, without equivocation, the Tánaiste said no, there would be no talks.  Does the Government not realise <Col N="2068" /> the enormous dangers arising from the fact that there are several hundred tonnes of arms and at least several tonnes of semtex still on this island, North and South, to which people who know the whereabouts of these arms can have resort?  If we are to satisfy everybody on both these islands about the prospects of the permanency of peace, would he not agree that the first task should be to seek to have these arms and explosives surrendered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about four aspects to the question and I will try to deal with them as best I can.  The Deputy states correctly that there has been a dramatic change since I answered questions in the Dáil on 1 June 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A dramatic change in Government policy.  I think I was right in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is prepared to quote from the record I too will quote from column 1019 of the Official Report of 1 June:</P>
      <P>The definitive abandonment of the use, or support, of violence for political ends would open the way to participation in political talks and to a role in the shaping of an agreed future for the Irish people.  It is also a precondition for participation in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Government is aware of the dangers that still persist on this island arising from the arms dumps North and South and, of course, we want to see them dismantled and the arms handed over.  The Deputy has stated that people have declined to hand these over but I am not sure if they have as yet declined to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they not been asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it has been brought to their attention how seriously <Col N="2069" /> the Government views this situation and it has been pointed out by numerous members of the Government &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and myself in particular &mdash; that as the organisations involved in violence heretofore have now stated that they are renouncing violence and there is an end to the campaign of violence by both quarters there is absolutely no further use for arms or need for the retention of arms dumps and we hope this will be brought to an end as quickly as possible.  It will certainly have to be on the agenda of whatever talks take place because until such time as the arms have been handed over and dismantled the threat to which the Deputy refers will persist on this island.  The danger is still there but we hope it can be brought to an end as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Government to avail of the window of opportunity that exists to commence dialogue.  Both IRA-Sinn Féin and the loyalist military command have said they want to move away from violence, enter the democratic process and enter into inclusive negotiations and I think we should avail of that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that while this very large quantity of arms and explosives remains at large there is a danger that the organisation who owns most of them could at some time in the future split into an armed political faction and that the danger of that happening, of which we are all conscious, would be greatly lessened if these arms and explosives were not available to anybody but were in the possession of the Government North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Deputy has to distinguish between the ideal and the possible in a situation such as this.  We are all very conscious, and those leading the Sinn Féin organisation to the negotiation table are very conscious also, of the history of that organisation and of the numerous splits that have taken place this century.  They are <Col N="2070" /> conscious of doing everything possible to avoid that.  I think it would be unrealistic &mdash; and the Deputy should confer with his colleague Deputy Michael McDowell on a discussion we had some weeks ago &mdash; to expect that the arms be handed over right now but I hope that it can be done in due course. The Government will not rest and I do not see a completion of any negotiations taking place until arrangements are made for the handing over of arms by both sides to the quarrel in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain what he meant by his reference in his reply to my first supplementary question that perhaps those who have possession of these arms have not declined to hand them over?  Does he mean that no request has been made to them?  What is the explanation of that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's view which has been made very clear to the Sinn Féin organisation in the original talks is that it wants to see the arms handed over and dismantled and nothing has happened to change its view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 61, 84, 99 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland and her partners in the European Union have welcomed the return to Haiti of the democratically elected President, Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. We are pleased that the international community's objective of restoring the lawful government to Haiti has been achieved without military confrontation and recognise the important role played by the United Nations-authorised multinational force and the United States of America in bringing this about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope the multinational force in Haiti will be successful in its efforts, in accordance with its mandate from the United Nations Security Council, to create the necessary conditions for the early deployment of the full United Nations Mission in Haiti.  The Security Council mandate provides for the UN Mission to replace the multinational force when a secure and stable environment has been established.  We hope the mission will soon be able to begin its programme of assistance to the Haitian Government and, in particular, to give <Col N="2072" /> practical support to the latter in its aim of promoting peace, national reconciliation and respect for law.</P>
    <P>For its part, Ireland is giving practical assistance to the process of reestablishing democracy in Haiti by contributing two observers to the 16 strong advance team of the United Nations. The advance team is overseeing the situation in Haiti on behalf of the United Nations and is also responsible for coordinating with the multinational force in preparing the ground for the deployment of the full UN Mission in Haiti.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also contribute to efforts to assist the people of Haiti through the European Union which has indicated its willingness to participate in the reconstruction of Haiti and to do everything in its power to support emergency humanitarian aid programmes.</P>
    <P>There are no plans for the moment to establish diplomatic relations with Haiti but this will not affect our support for the Government of President Aristide or our continued efforts to help the Haitian people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his reply and welcome the return to power of President Aristide after an appalling bloody period in the history of Haiti.  The Tánaiste stated that the United Nations will make a decision on when to replace the multinational force. Who will decide when to remove it and how will it be judged that the situation has improved sufficiently to remove a multinational force?  Also, will the Tánaiste indicate the aid and humanitarian assistance our Government is willing to give to rebuild the medical health system, the educational system and, more importantly, the whole justice system in Haiti including the police force, the courts etc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the United Nations will make a judgment on when to move into Haiti.  I hope that happens sooner rather than later; on the basis of the progress to date, it would be a reasonable expectation.  In relation to <Col N="2073" /> Ireland giving assistance to Haiti, the European Union has already indicated it is prepared to become involved in the reconstruction of Haiti which, as I see it, involves issues such as those the Deputy suggested in terms of health services, the judicial system in Haiti and the question of an emergency humanitarian aid programme.  We will participate through that programme as we have participated in most other programmes throughout the world and, once again, neither the Government nor our people will be found to have any shortcomings in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 42, 49, 62, 73 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Sanctions were imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council as a result of Iraq's invasion and attempted annexation of Kuwait in 1990.  Various Security Council Resolutions set out the conditions which must be fulfilled before action can be taken to ease sanctions including respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and the establishment of an effective control system to verify that Iraq meets its obligations in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  It is matter for the Security Council to decide when the conditions are fully met and when the sanctions can be suspended or lifted.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully observes Security Council sanctions and implements them in its domestic regulations and practices.  In accordance with our international obligations we will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The Government also supports Security Council Resolution 833 which reaffirms the inviolability of the borders of Kuwait.  The deployment of substantial numbers of Iraqi troops close to the border with Kuwait earlier this month was a matter of grave concern.  In a statement issued on 11 October, the European Union urged Iraq to withdraw its troops immediately from the border region and refrain from confrontation.  The Union also urged Iraq to cooperate fully with the implementation of all relevant Security Council Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome recent reports that Iraq is <Col N="2075" /> withdrawing its troops from the Kuwaiti border area and that it may now be ready to recognise the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait in accordance with Resolution 833.</P>
    <P>I remain convinced that the full compliance of Iraq with all relevant resolutions of the Security Council is the means whereby a de-escalation of tensions, an increase in security and durable peace can be brought to the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his reply and I have no doubt the Security Council is capable of thinking for itself and making decisions accordingly. Will the Tánaiste bear in mind, however, other reports emanating from Iraq, not mentioned in his reply, which indicate that much suffering has taken place there?  More people have died from hunger and malnutrition since the invasion of Kuwait than in the military operation and the ongoing suffering of the people should be a factor.  Will the Tánaiste indicate whether there is any room for a <i>quid pro quo</i> in return for the dismantling of military capabilities? Is he prepared, on behalf of the Government to support an easing of the sanctions which could perhaps find an expression in willingness to allow military aid to be sent to Iraq if that was required to alleviate the suffering and malnutrition reported from Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters raised by the Deputy are matters of genuine concern. We have all heard reports of great hardships to the Iraqi civilian population resulting from sanctions.  I would point out that the importation of medical supplies and basic foodstuffs into Iraq is not prohibited by the UN sanctions.  In addition, the UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 permit the export of oil to fund purchases of food, medicines and goods for essential civilian use.  Iraq has refused to accept the terms of these resolutions.  It must bear some if not all of the responsibility for the continued deterioration of living standards.  This is regrettable.  Iraq and its <Col N="2076" /> leadership has to make much progress in terms of meeting what I regard as the legitimate concerns of the United Nations, if not the rest of the world, and if Iraq makes the moves required, the rest of the world will respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste elaborate further on that?  If the Iraqi authorities are using the sanctions as a political football to blackmail the rest of the world through the imposition of humanitarian hardship on their own country, is it possible that could be addressed as a single issue rather than using the sledgehammer of imposing sanctions to force Iraq to change its position while its civilians suffer?  Am I correct that some of the motivation for maintaining sanctions is that the interests of the oil industry are keen to maintain high oil prices?  This should not be allowed to cloud the picture when it comes to alleviating human suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not allow any aspect, such as oil prices, cloud the issues in the hardship endured by the civilian population.  We must be clear, however, on the actual position.  The principal requirement for lifting sanctions is agreement on the part of members of the Security Council that Iraq has complied with all relevant Security Council resolutions.  The main obligations imposed on Iraq by the UN are set out in Resolution 687 which contains, <i>inter alia</i>, detailed provisions concerning the disposal of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the establishment of a system that would allow the UN to monitor Iraqi compliance with the terms of the resolution in the future. Resolution 687 also demands that Iraq and Kuwait respect the inviolability of each other's borders.  This was further elaborated on in Security Council Resolution 833.  I do not wish to follow up the line of a political football but Iraq must make certain gestures and what it did in the last few weeks has not helped its standing in the international community.  We all have obligations and in <Col N="2077" /> this case Iraq has obligations which it must try to fulfil.</P>

      <P>Tá me chun Ceisteanna 38 agus 122 a fhreagairt le chéile.</P>
      <P>Is sa bhliain 1973, ar dhul isteach dúinn sa Chomhphobal Eorpach, a bunaíodh stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach.  Cuirtear in iúl go reachtúil é in Alt 3 d'ár gConradh Aontachais.</P>
      <P>Tá na Conarthaí bunaidh uile ar fáil i nGaeilge, mar shampla na Conraithe Aontachais, An tAcht Eorpach Aonair agus Conradh Mhaastruicht ar an Aontas Eorpach.</P>
      <P>Tá an Ghaeilge á úsáid freisin ar Pasanna Eorpacha i ngach tír san Aontas, ar chomh-chéim leis na teangacha eile.</P>
      <P>Ach ní teanga oibre den Aontas Eorpach an Ghaeilge.  Ní luaitear an Ghaeilge i liosta &ldquo;teangacha oifigiúla agus oibre Institiúidí an Chomphobail&rdquo; a tá mar aguisín ar an Ionstraim dhleathach den Chomhairle ina leagtar amach go foirmeálta córas teangacha an Aontais.</P>
      <P>Tá staidéar déanta agam ar mholtaí Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge i dtaobh stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mí Meitheamh bhuail oifigigh ó mo Roinn-se, maraon le hoifigigh ó Ranna Stáit eile a bhuil baint acu leis an cheist, <Col N="2078" /> go háirithe ón Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúrtha agus Gaeltachta, le hionadaí ó Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus eagraíochtaí eile Gaeilge, chun a dtuairimí ar úsáid na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach a phlé.</P>
    <P>Is dócha go mbeidh córas teangacha na nInstitiúidí i measc na ceisteanna a bheas le plé ag an Chomhdháil idir Ionadaithe na mBallstát (CIB no Intergovernmental Conference) i 1996.  Tá ordú tugtha agam go ndéanfaí mionscrúdú, le feiscint ar chóir don Rialtas ceist stádas na Gaeilge a tharraingt anuas ag an Intergovernmental Conference.  Sa scrúdú sin cuirfear san áireamh torthaí na gcainteanna leis na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus na moltaí úd ó Chómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 39, 54, 57, 80, 102 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The scale of the suffering endured by the people of Rwanda since the crisis began last April has been immense.  Up to one million people may have died. More than two million have fled to neighbouring countries and up to two million more are displaced internally.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there will be a continued need for international action on a very large scale to facilitate the process of political reconciliation, to reconstruct the country and to create the conditions which will facilitate the return of the refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the political level the Government of National Unity has begun to put civilian administrative structures in place at the central, provincial and local level but every effort should be made <Col N="2082" /> to ensure that the Government and the army are more broadly based, and that civil and political rights are respected. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General is working actively to these ends and he has our full support.</P>
    <P>The Government in Kigali has appealed to the international community for an immediate injection of financial help to put civil structures in place.  Ireland will support this appeal with our European partners.</P>
    <P>In my recent address to the UN General Assembly I called for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal along the lines of that organised for the former Yugoslavia, to bring justice to those accused of genocide and other grave violations of humanitarian law.  In addition there is a clear need to monitor human rights and to prevent possible human rights violations from occurring.  I am concerned that no more than 30 of the 147 human rights monitors recommended by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights have been put in place.  We shall continue to press for early progress in these areas.</P>
    <P>On the peacekeeping front, the UN Force in Rwanda (UNAMIR) stands at 4,300 out of a total authorised strength of 5,500.  The rapid reinforcement of the force in early August contributed to the improvement of security inside Rwanda.  It is hoped that as stability improves UNAMIR will be able to shift its emphasis from purely security related tasks to the support of humanitarian operations to assist populations in need and the return of refugees and displaced persons.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian needs arising from the Rwandan crisis are huge and continue to stretch the capacity of the international community.  The UN Special Representative, UNHCR and UNAMIR are actively trying to create the conditions to enable refugees to return to Rwanda and displaced persons to return to their homes but this is inhibited by the continuation of intimidation within the camps and by the security conditions in parts of Rwanda itself.  I believe that the actions I have <Col N="2083" /> just outlined in the political and human rights areas will have a crucial bearing on the eventual solution to the refugee problems.</P>
    <P>There will also be a need for increased attention to longer-term rehabilitation.  It is vital that the international community provides quick and efficient rehabilitation assistance.  To this end the UN has drawn up a Rwanda emergency normalisation plan which outlines the areas requiring both financial and technical assistance.  The UN Development Programme has begun projects to support the development of Government Ministries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been actively involved bilaterally, in the European Union and at the United Nations, in addressing the crisis.  The recent visit of the President was intended to show solidarity with the people of Rwanda and to underline the need for international action.  Specific measures taken by the Government include: a contribution of £3.25 million for emergency relief programmes; a contribution of £50,000 for the UN voluntary fund established by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights; the release of some 35 medical and logistical personnel from the Irish public service to assist Irish aid agencies, and the release of over 60 personnel from the Defence Forces to assist, in a civilian capacity, in the humanitarian work of UNHCR and Irish NGOs.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to all these Irish people who are giving selflessly of their time and energy in helping to overcome one of the greatest tragedies of our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well recognised that the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister have been very generous in their response to the appalling genocide in Rwanda where up to one million people died.  Is the Minister aware of the book issued by African Rights which reports that girls as young as five years were <Col N="2084" /> gang raped in public and that the appalling crime in this area was unprecedented?</P>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister the generosity and concern shown by a great number of ordinary Irish people. In this context, it should be noted that Senators Cotter and Reynolds and Deputy Owen spent up to a month working in a voluntary capacity with agencies in Rwanda.  I also want to point out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that while the level of aid during the emergency was very generous it must be continued. There is also a real need for civil servants, engineers, teachers and technicians in Rwanda.  Will the Government consider some element of assistance in the context of the Rwandan normalisation plan, which is what the Rwanda Government really needs from now on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks about the efforts of my Department and officials in coping with this horrendous tragedy.  I compliment Deputy Owen and Senators Reynolds and Cotter who gave their time in dealing with this appalling human tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, recently visited Rwanda and we are examining their conclusions.  The President will meet the Secretary General of the United Nations at the earliest opportunity.  It is important that we maintain the highest possible level of world attention on Rwanda.  We are still very far away from achieving an ideal situation in Rwanda and I am aware of the grotesque incidents which have occurred in that country during the past two years.  This is probably one of the greatest challenges the international community has ever had to face, and this is not to underestimate the difficulties in the former Yugoslavia which we discussed some time ago.  The machinery of the United <Col N="2085" /> Nations and the international community has been put to the pin of its collar in coping with the size and scale of the tragedy, from which lessons must be learned.  Following the Arusha Accord, there were prospects of avoiding such a tragedy.  I do not think anyone realised at that stage the devastation which would take place on the failure of the Arusha Accord, and nobody could have predicted some of the unfortunate things which happened.</P>
    <P>I thank the Irish people for their support and we will work with them with all the facilities at our disposal.  The initial response to the decision to second public servants to Rwanda was overwhelming.  As Deputy Kenny said, obviously there is a necessity for people with an expertise in particular areas and, unfortunately, some of the people who make themselves available do not have the required skills.  The response from the public service and the military authorities, in terms of the contingents which have been sent to Rwanda, has been phenomenal.  We will do everything possible to honour our international obligations.  It is very important during the process of reconstructing Rwanda and its society &mdash; it will take a long time to get away from the appalling genocide and crimes &mdash; for the international community to take every possible step to ensure that we do not witness another Rwandan crisis during our lifetime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and Deputy Kenny for the tributes they paid me.  Is the Minister aware of the total breakdown in civil society in Rwanda and the urgent need for assistance to be given to the Government to rebuild the educational, health and justice systems? There are no local authorities or police force in Rwanda.  Will he consider extending the six month rule in regard to public and civil servants he introduced during the emergency so that they can continue their work in a more constructive way after the emergency, help to rebuild that society and avoid further tragedy?  Will he today raise <Col N="2086" /> with the office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights the scandal whereby the request to send 200 peace monitors to Rwanda at the beginning of June has not been answered?  There are only 20 to 30 peace monitors in Rwanda at present and this is preventing the safe repatriation of many refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the devastation in Rwanda and the absence of any normality in that society.  Following the visit to Rwanda by the President and the Minister of State we will reassess our attitude to Rwanda, which to date has been very flexible, and look at the role played by the public servants on the original mission.  We have had much discussion with the NGOs working on the ground.  Obviously I share the Deputy's concerns in regard to the number of peace monitors in Rwanda &mdash; I think the present number is 30 &mdash; and I will raise the matter with the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is necessary for the international community to ensure that the ringleaders of the groups which committed the awful crimes in Rwanda are brought to trial?  Does he accept the need for an international tribunal or similar institution based in Rwanda before which the ringleaders can be tried and given their just desserts?  If we let pass the slaughter of approximately one million people and the other awful crimes which have been committed, some of which were referred to by Deputy Kenny, it will amount to an encouragement to similarly minded people in other countries to engage in such activities.  Does the Minister accept that we have a duty to press at international level, UN level etc., for the establishment of such a tribunal?  If we fail to do this, Rwanda will become like Burundi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  During my address to the United Nations General Assembly in September I said it <Col N="2087" /> was a priority of the Irish Government that there should be an international tribunal along the lines of the tribunal established for the former Yugoslavia so that those accused of genocide and the other grave violations of the humanitarian laws referred to by Deputy Kenny can be brought to justice.  We should have a permanent world court so that those who get involved in situations like Rwanda and Yugoslavia know that they have to be brought to book.  That is lacking in the international legal system and we should all work towards achieving it.  Obviously, there is no point in having it unless it has the capacity and the effectiveness to do the task we set out to do but we should move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that all the senior civil servants in Rwanda have been killed and that the Government's request is for people with expertise, be they graduates or technicians, is there some method by which our Government could ensure that some qualified people from Ireland who may want to work in a country such as Rwanda would be given that facility?  Without wishing to take from the massive human and voluntary effort by the aid agencies who participate in times of emergency such as this, is the Minister satisfied that there is a cohesive and co-ordinated approach from Irish aid agencies to deliver effectively the most human answer to the tragedy that befell Rwanda?  In some instances co-ordination is not evident in the workings on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would wish to do everything possible to facilitate graduates and qualified personnel with the skills required on the ground to get involved in the whole process.  In regard to the delivery of humanitarian services, the NGOs here have a record which is second to none.  We may not have the same spending power as organisations in other countries.  I pay tribute to the Irish people for the funding of <Col N="2088" /> those resources.  We are fulfilling our commitment to development aid under the Programme for Government.  We want to get back up to the 0.7 per cent of GDP and we are well on the way to doing that.  I hope we can continue that effort for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government.  The NGOs are doing an excellent job at great personal sacrifice.  At times there may be an element of competition but that is not of any consequence.  We take the opportunity on a regular basis to have discussions with them.  As late as this morning I met officials from Oxfam who were particularly complimentary of the work being done by the Minister of State and me and of our availability to have discussions and to work with them in terms of the programmes.  We will also have discussions with APSO who play an important role in the deployment of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too pay tribute to the work of the Irish agencies, Concern, Goal, Trócaire, the Medical Missionaries of Mary, the Irish Refugee Trust and many Irish people attached to bodies such as the UNHCR, Karen Kenny, and so on.  Has any effort been made to contact the President of Zaire to bring more pressure to bear regarding what is taking place in the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire, Goma and Katale where there is clear intimidation of many of the refugees?  It must be made clear to the President of Zaire that he cannot condone the rebuilding of the militia within his borders so that they can cause another war inside Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy rightly focuses on a very difficult problem.  In the camps in Goma there is intimidation by the extremist Hutu elements to prevent refugees from returning.  There are up to 2 million people internally displaced within Rwanda, likewise there are 2 million refugees in Zaire, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda and obviously there will be tension.  The European Union has been in contact on a regular basis with the Presidency in Zaire.  We <Col N="2089" /> will assess the report made available in the wake of President Robinson's visit. I have no difficulty in having discussions with the Fine Gael spokesperson or other spokespersons.  All contributions which help to resolve the difficulties are welcome.</P>

      <P>China has been a member of the United Nations since the foundation of the organisation in 1945.  Until 1971 it was represented by the Nationalist Government in Taipei.  Since then, following the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 2758, the Government of the People's Republic of China has been the sole occupant of China's seat.</P>
      <P>When Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 it recognised the Government of the People's Republic as the sole legal government of China.  I do not envisage that there will be any change in our position on this issue.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste accept it is ridiculous that the country which is the fourteenth largest trading nation in the world is excluded from the 180 members of the United Nations? Does he further accept that Taiwan has a <i>per capita</i> income of $10,000 and the second largest foreign exchange reserve in the world at over $80 billion, second only to Japan?  Does he not accept it is ridiculous that Taiwan should be excluded from the United Nations? Like other Members of this House, I have been a guest of the Republic of China in Taiwan and have been impressed with the progress made there, <Col N="2091" /> particularly in the establishment of a multi-party democratic system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Deputy's recent election experience he probably would not want to fight a general election for three years.  I am aware of the matters to which the Deputy refers in relation to the strength of Taiwan in the international trading community.  We must make some distinctions.  I do not think that either Taiwan or Beijing consider that they are two Chinas; the conflict between them is in relation to who represents China.  The position in former East Germany or North Korea is different.  Taiwan is not recognised internationally as a separate state.  The admission of East Germany and North Korea to the UN took place with the agreement of the Federal Republic of Germany and South Korea.  Similar conditions do not apply in the case of Taiwan.  While Taiwan is not going to be a member of the United Nations &mdash; we do not support any application by it &mdash; that does not affect its status as a trading territory.  The question of that country joining GATT is under consideration. Ireland recognises the importance of both China and Taiwan to international trade.  We would hope they will have membership of GATT at an early date.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste accept that it is not necessary, under international law, to recognise officially a particular country to support its admission to the United Nations?  The PLO was accepted at the UN long before the recent accords.  Will the Tánaiste accept that the Republic of China in Taiwan could be accepted as a member, not only of GATT but of the United Nations, without in any way affecting our recognition of the People's Republic of China in Beijing?</P>

We do not recognise Taiwan as a separate State and, consequently, do not have diplomatic relations with it, but that does not prevent co-operation on an economic level between Irish enterprises and their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>

      <P>At the risk of repetition, is it not a fact that Taiwan is a strong, autonomous and vibrant country with the largest foreign reserves of any nation, an excellent human rights record &mdash; unlike many other members of the UN &mdash; and a full and open democratic <Col N="2093" /> system of Government?  Will the Minister agree that it meets all the criteria for membership of the UN?  Also, will he agree that, apart from the reservation of Communist China, no strong reason has been advanced as to why it should not become a member of the UN?  As the Minister's last three or four replies in regard to the crisis in Rwanda centred mainly on resources, will he agree that Taiwan, as a member of the United Nations, could be a valuable contributor in terms of financing the work of the UN?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects regarding membership of the United Nations to which the Deputies do not give due regard.  Obviously, there would have to be consensus on the admission of any country to the United Nations. The Deputies are also missing an historical point in relation to Taiwan and the People's Republic of China.  The People's Republic of China took the Chinese seat at the UN when it entered in 1971, a seat which, until then, had been occupied by representatives of the Nationalist Government in Taiwan, which still claimed to be the legitimate Government of all China, including Taiwan.  Many countries requested Taiwan's membership of the UN put on this year's agenda, but that did not happen.  Similar requests were made last year but there was not consensus on the issue.  The European Union did not adopt a position, but I believe all its members regard the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate Government of China, including Taiwan.  Both Deputies have been to Taiwan and are aware that we have excellent trading relations with that country, relations which I hope will grow in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he explain why Ireland could not at least support the request to set up a sub-committee of the UN to consider Taiwan's application in accordance with the established model of parallel representation of divided countries?  That is not asking the Minister to <Col N="2094" /> say whether he wants them to become members.  As such a committee was set up by the Portuguese representatives to take issues relating to East Timor off the UN agenda, why could Ireland not agree to set up such a sub-committee in this case and support the 12 countries that submitted such a request to Boutros Boutros Ghali?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is fairly straightforward.  If Ireland gave formal recognition to Taiwan either as the legitimate Government of all of China &mdash; which it still nominally claimes to be &mdash; or as an independent State, the probable consequences would be the severance of diplomatic relations between Ireland and China.  We are not ready to make that move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not indicating that China, which happens to be a member of the Security Council, is holding a veto over Taiwan in regard to membership of the UN?  It has the resources and the economic wealth to participate in many aspects of United Nations' work, particularly in the role of peacekeeping.  Is the Minister not sustaining and supporting the view that a member of the Security Council can veto another country's application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Higgins &mdash; and the Deputy is well aware of the discussions within the United Nations &mdash; reform is on the basis of consensus and that will apply in regard to the Taiwanese application.  If there is consensus, there will be no difficulty about the application, but that is not yet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that the United States Senate <Col N="2095" /> passed a unanimous vote supporting the admission of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to the United Nations?  Will he agree that China was divided in 1949 and that the UN resolution in 1971 provided for the international representation of the Chinese people only on the mainland under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China and that since then the 21 million people on the island of Taiwan and the adjoining islands have not been represented?  It is outrageous to accept that the Beijing Government represents those people, it has tried to smother and shell them over the years.  Surely Taiwan should now be allowed to take its place as one of the premier nations of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat for the umpteenth time that, in terms of our relationship with Taiwan and acceptance of its status, Ireland's establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China involved recognition of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate Government of China and, in the view of the Beijing and Taipei authorities, includes the island of Taiwan. Perhaps this matter should be on the agenda of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Strong arguments have been made against the basis of the application being along the lines suggested by Deputy Owen, namely, an established model of parallel representation of divided countries.  China rejects such an approach and, as I said earlier, there was international agreement regarding the German and Korean applications.  The two parts of both those countries were widely recognised by the international community, but that is not the case in respect of Taiwan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 75, 88 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The Joint Framework document for political talks on the future of Northern Ireland is the subject of intensive negotiation between the Irish and British Governments at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues involved are complex and sensitive and require the most careful consideration.  While good progress has been made in dealing with them, much work remains to be done and it is not possible at this stage to anticipate with <Col N="2097" /> total certainty when our discussions might be completed.</P>
    <P>It is, however, the intention of the two Governments to bring this work to a conclusion at the earliest opportunity. I hope to see this done by about the end of the month and to have the document ratified by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister very shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have reviewed at regular intervals the progress made by our officials in their work on this document. We availed most recently of the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in London on 22-23 September to exchange views on a number of aspects and to give instructions for further work.  I am arranging to have a copy of the communique issued following the conference placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>Decisions remain to be taken by the Governments on how the agreed framework document can best be used to engage the political parties in renewed political dialogue and to encourage them on the road to agreement.  Issues such as the timing and modalities of possible publication will be among the matters for discussion by the two Governments in this respect.</P>
    <P>The timing of political talks subsequent to the framework document will be a matter for discussion and agreement among all the participants in such talks in due course.  The view of the Irish Government is that recent developments offer a unique window of opportunity for progress.  We believe strongly that the momentum of the peace process must be sustained by moving to comprehensive political negotiations at the earliest possible opportunity.  We will continue to work for that goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage the discussions on the framework document which, as he says, hopefully will be published by the end of the month continuing in tandem with the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, or does he anticipate one or other of those <Col N="2098" /> taking precedence in terms of time at least and, if so, which?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate either taking precedence; they are two quite separate exercises.  As the Deputy will be aware, with the round of discussions taking place between the Taoiseach, myself and party leaders here in the course of this week, we are hopeful we can have the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation established by early November.  As I said in my reply, we hope to have the framework document published by about the end of the month and I believe it will be helpful to the deliberations and discussions within the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  It is important to have the framework document published and circulated to the parties for consideration as quickly as possible, allowing both processes to continue in tandem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is much more important for all parties, in particular all parties in Northern Ireland, to become involved in the talks in regard to the political future &mdash; which would follow publication of the framework document &mdash; and that progress would be made there rather than have a discussion in Dublin involving some parties only at which apparently no decisions are envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a degree of logic in the Deputy's proposition.  It is vital that as many parties as possible participate in the discussions.  Originally some people envisaged the forum being pan-nationalist.  I do not think most parties in this House want to be part of a pan-nationalist forum and I do not foresee it being a pan-nationalist forum.  As I said earlier today, we welcome the participation of the Alliance Party in the forum.  I hope that others will find some way of making submissions to the forum or be represented on it by way of written submissions or orally.  It is very important to respect the views of all parties on this island in relation to the <Col N="2099" /> efforts we are all making to ascertain whether we can now develop the opportunity that has existed since 31 August last on the renunciation of violence by the IRA; likewise since last week in relation to the announcement by the loyalist combined military command.  It behoves all parties, not just the Government, to participate to ascertain whether we can bring that process to a conclusion which will keep violence, the bomb and bullet, out of Irish politics for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister used the words &ldquo;comprehensive political negotiations&rdquo; whereas in other statements the words &ldquo;inclusive discussions&rdquo; were used.  Will he spell out exactly who will participate in the discussions and negotiations on the framework document?  Will he say which political parties will be invited to sit down if that document is published within the next four weeks?  In addition, will he agree that it is disingenuous not to make absolutely clear beforehand the exact role of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in regard to the framework document because I understand it will not have a role to play in any negotiation on that document and it would be better to make that clear before the forum is established, if that is the intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in making things as clear as I can at this time.  The Deputy will recall I said that obviously the modalities and timing of certain aspects of the framework document must be agreed by both Governments.  How the framework document travels, if I may put it like that, obviously must be agreed and has not yet been agreed between the two Governments; that will be discussed at our next meeting.  Indeed the Deputy recognises a distinction between the role of Government and Oppostion parties.  Obviously the Governments have been working on this framework document for a number of months and we hope to bring it to a conclusion shortly. <Col N="2100" /> It will be made available to all parties because I do not think anybody in his right mind would think that one could give it to certain parties only &mdash; not that we want to exclude anybody &mdash; but obviously that framework document will be central to the negotiations'&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We hope all the parties will participate but that has to be agreed first between the Governments and, as the House will be aware, the British Government's position is unfolding in relation to its attitude to the renunciation of violence by the IRA, and I hope will continue to unfold over the next few days.  Second, we must get agreement.  We and the British Government can issue joint invitations to people to participate in talks but we must await their response.</P>

      <P>I expressed reservations that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could be counter-productive but I hope my fears will prove unfounded.  However, I presume the framework document will deal to some degree with the internal governance of Northern Ireland.  What will be the follow-up to that framework document?  For example, will those aspects dealing with the internal governance of <Col N="2101" /> Northern Ireland be discussed, as it were, like Strand I of the last peace talks?  Will it be discussed in tandem with the forum deliberations?  Will the Minister outline his perception of the function of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in relation to the framework document, how the forum can contribute to the debate on that document and the necessary decisions that will have to be taken following its publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as I think the Deputy will recognise, we want to see the framework document agreed and published as quickly as possible, to get it into the public arena.  If one was to attempt to do otherwise certain fears and paranoia would be fuelled.  I also hope, with the forum getting under way, that the framework document will be a subject for discussion at the forum, allowing all parties to express their views in terms of the efforts of both Governments to set out the framework which will form the basis of the relationships between both islands, setting out a future for Northern Ireland, and the totality of relationships, if I may revert to using that phrase.  I hope that the forum will be afforded an opportunity of putting the framework document on its agenda.  However, the forum will also have other work in relation to what is necessary to establish peace and reconciliation on this island; it will have a lot of work to do in that regard, perhaps far wider than the parameters of the framework document itself.  I do not think we can fully anticipate the work of the forum.  It will have a momentum of its own and, as the Government said, will continue for as long as necessary, as long as it can make an input in relation to what is happening in the politics of this island.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say whether the framework document will refer to internal governance in Northern Ireland or &mdash; and this is what has been suggested in certain other quarters and is the reason it warrants clarification <Col N="2102" />&mdash; will it refer only to those matters which will be covered by Strands II and III of discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will be aware of the intentions of both Governments to set out the relationships between both Governments and in relation to the future of Northern Ireland.  The Deputy will be very familiar with the basis of the round table discussions previously in relation to Strands I, II and III, when Strand I was a matter pertaining to the internal administration of Northern Ireland and in internal matter for Northern Ireland. However, I hope that, when the framework document is published, it will be received and welcomed by all parties because, as we said on many occasions, nobody need feel threatened by it because it will set out in a very realistic and practical way the views of both Governments at this stage in relation to the prospects for Northern Ireland.</P>

Is he aware that the company concerned has been treated extremely badly, has suffered enormous losses and, in particular, the Department of Foreign Affairs in replying to the Article 169 proceedings taken against Ireland by the Commission arising out of this matter, made statements in the reply dated 5 March 1991 which were found in a subsequent judgment of Mr. Justice Costello in the High Court to be totally and flagrantly untrue?  Will the Minister stand over that reply of his Department of 5 March 1991 to the Article 169 proceedings against Ireland when he is now aware that the defence put up by Ireland is based on statements which are untrue and to use the words of Mr. Justice Costello are totally unjustifiable and indefensible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, a Member for the constituency of Cork North-Central.</P>
      <P>It is with a sense of sadness that we in the Labour Party find it necessary to come before you today to move this writ for the by-election in Cork North-Central.  The death of our colleague and friend, Gerry O'Sullivan, has given rise to this by-election.  There is no need for me to remind the House &mdash; I have already paid tribute to his memory &mdash; how much we all feel his loss.</P>
      <P>Gerry O'Sullivan was elected to the Dáil in 1989 and appointed to the office of Minister of State within a very short time.  He was a very hard worker, an able negotiator and, above all, a man who never lost touch with the people he grew up with in his constituency.  His door at his home in Baker's Road was always open to every constituent, whatever the circumstances, and they knew that.  He enjoyed nothing more than a stroll down Shandon Street on a Saturday afternoon, as was referred to by the Tánaiste in his tributes to him.  That is what politics meant to Gerry.  He had an easy manner and a lovely way with people which made him popular with everybody, young and old, and with every Member of this House who had the honour to serve with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry O'Sullivan never regarded his seat, for which he worked so hard as his personal property.  His job as a public representative was the focus of his life but he knew he was only holding the seat in trust, as indeed are all of us, for the constituents he represented and the <Col N="2237" /> party from which he accepted the Whip. He would have wished the by-election to go ahead as quickly as possible because he would have liked to make sure the people in his north city constituency would not be denied the best possible representation in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are very glad that Gerry's daughter, Lisa, has decided to put her name forward as a candidate in this by-election &mdash; she offered herself to a convention in Cork last Sunday.  We must pay tribute to her for offering herself to her contituents in the difficult task of serving them in public life.  We would be particularly proud to welcome her into the Chamber in this term.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition have put forward the theory that to elect another TD for the Government party will serve no useful purpose for the people of Cork, and I have listened to this argument with amazement.  That is simply not true.  If they do not believe me, they should canvass on the streets where they will get the message.  Many of the people of Cork would tell them who was the saviour of Irish Steel.  Nobody can deny the part played, directly or indirectly, by this Government in the case of Irish Steel, for the good of Cork and the economy generally.  I pay tribute to my colleagues in Government, the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the Tánaiste and Deputies Toddy O'Sullivan and John Mulvihill who worked night and day to make sure Irish Steel was saved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We pay tribute to everybody who helped.  We are proud to have played an active role in ensuring the matter was brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  We know the importance of Irish Steel to the people of Cork.  We also know the importance of education. In this regard the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, sanctioned the building of a new community school in Glanmire, Cork.  People who advocate that the Government is doing <Col N="2238" /> nothing should read the record.  Unfortunately they like to rake muck during an election campaign, but the record of Ministers, particularly in Cork, can stand scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The people of Cork know that the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, allocated funding to the Mercy Hospital and is committed to the complete redevelopment of facilities there.  The port of Cork, in which the late Gerry O'Sullivan was directly involved has been transformed in recent years due to allocations of funding for its development.  It is also due to benefit from further allocations of EU Cohesion Funds.  The people know of the Minister, Deputy Stagg's visit to Cork to see the urgent need for remedial works on many of the flat complexes there.  He has embarked on a major programme of renovation and refurbishment.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Opposition listen to some of these comments. They have been advocating doom and gloom for a long time and the truth must be told.  The people know that waiting lists in the Southern Health Board area have been reduced as a result of Deputy Howlin's initiatives and that the health board's overdraft was significantly reduced by using funds raised by the tax amnesty, about which everybody was concerned.  This was advocated by some Opposition Members in various committees.</P>

      <P>When my party colleagues come to Cork to campaign they will realise that the main entry and exit routes have been greatly upgraded, and work will continue in this regard.  Gerry O'Sullivan, unlike some of my colleagues on the left, never made election <Col N="2239" /> promises.  However, he promised that if elected he would work night and day for the good of his constituents.  He did so without fear or favour.  I am sure that Lisa now offering herself for election will give the same commitment and, like her father, will never turn a constituent from the door.  I am sure we will have the opportunity to introduce her to the Ceann Comhairle in this House after the by-election.  On the other by-election, Councillor Gerry O'Flynn is capable of taking a seat for the Labour Party.  We are ready for this by-election.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to follow that contribution.  The vacancy in Cork North Central arises from the untimely and sad death of the late Gerry O'Sullivan while the vacancy in Cork South Central arises from circumstances I regret.  It arises as a result of a commitment made on behalf of my party to the electorate in Cork South Central in the November 1992 election. I and my colleagues in the parliamentary party felt bound to honour the commitment made in order to seek electoral support and we paid a very heavy price.  Sometimes in politics doing the right thing does not necessarily mean winning short term popular support.  We now have an opportunity to replace the two Deputies.  I am delighted the Government is proposing the writ in one case and apparently not opposing it in the other.  Unfortunately we had to wait 18 months earlier in the life of this Dáil to replace two other vacancies and the Government parties learned their lesson from that long wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This election arose in very strange circumstances and the people of Cork will have an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government.  To a large extent the two by-elections will be referenda on the Government's performance.  For the last few weeks we had a Government in exile, with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste <Col N="2240" /> meeting at a military base to talk to each other.  When the Taoiseach phones the Tánaiste and <i>vice versa</i> it is a major news item.  That is not a natural Government.  There was a row about judicial appointments which the public finds difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>Because some spin doctor decided he needed a brain child &mdash; Tinakilly House &mdash; to pretend to the public that all was well, the Government departed yesterday for a one day honeymoon.  It may have had beef &mdash; I saw the menu &mdash; and it may have had tipsy pudding, but it certainly had some fudge as well.  From what we heard earlier, there has been much fudge and we are still none the wiser about the Government's intentions.  Anyone who thinks this is a cohesive Government simply has to look at the comments of the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach.  The Tánaiste told us yesterday he will make proposals to the Government, in order to get one up on the Minister for Justice, and today we heard that some of the proposals will be followed through by the Minister for Justice, but apparently there will be no proposals relating to the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of issues. On 1 September when we debated the report of the Beef Tribunal the Tánaiste said, column 445 of the Official Report of Thursday, 1 September: &ldquo;The way in which we in this House deal with this report has the potential to mark a defining moment in public life in this country&rdquo;.  With Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party walked through the lobbies thus preventing Deputies on the Opposition benches from questioning the Taoiseach or any Minister about the policy disaster between the years 1987 and 1989.  Since then questions tabled by me and other Opposition leaders have been transferred by the Taoiseach to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, who was not even a member of the 1987-89 Government.</P>
    <P>This Government is not accountable to the Dáil, does not want to level with the people and does not believe in openness, transparency and truth.  These <Col N="2241" /> will be among the issues that will be debated in the forthcoming by-elections.  Accountability in public life is extremely important and in a parliamentary democracy the people we elect to the highest office in the land should be accountable.</P>
    <P>Earlier, by way of a point of order, I asked the Ceann Comhairle why he had ruled a question of mine out of order on the grounds that it could lead to argument.  It was a simple question: when did the Taoiseach cease his managerial involvement with C &amp; D Foods?  On two occasions the chairman of the beef tribunal said that there would have been no need for a tribunal if questions had been answered in the Dáil.  On some occasions it was a case of Ministers failing to answer questions but, unfortunately, on others it was a case of the Ceann Comhairle not allowing the questions in the first place.  The circumstances which led to the beef tribunal, unfortunately, still exist today.  The extract from the book, <i>The Longford Leader</i>, published last Sunday showed that the Taoiseach in 1982 was still actively involved with C &amp; D Foods.  On 30 May in this House the Taoiseach told us that he had not been involved with that company for 14 years and he told the beef tribunal that he had been involved up to 1987.  This is a contradiction, yet we cannot ask any questions. Perhaps Deputy McDowell and Deputy Rabbitte will have to get together and agree to another Bill to allow us an opportunity to discuss the matter in the House.</P>

      <P>There are many companies in Cork which, given the opportunity to avail of a £1.1 million soft loan, <Col N="2242" /> would be able to employ several more people.  It is the small companies around Cork which badly need financial investment.  If they were given the opportunity that the Taoiseach's family company was given, how many jobs would they be able to create for the people of Cork?</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the amnesty; I thought the Labour Party had forgotten about that.  The candidates who will stand for the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in the by-election stand for the amnesty.  What was the purpose of that amnesty?</P>

      <P>Even in cases where the Revenue Commissioners knew the amounts outstanding companies got away with paying 15 per cent.  A constituent of Deputy Rabbitte and mine invested all his redundancy money in a business.  Recently he had his C2 certificate withdrawn by the Revenue Commissioners even though he owed less than £6,000.  As a result he has gone out of business.  That person asked me recently if, having regard to the way Larry Goodman was treated, there was any point in trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Labour Party in particular is prepared to keep its head down, its mouth shut and stay <Col N="2243" /> in office at any cost.  As recent events have proved, with a few honourable exceptions, when the Labour Party enters Government it wants to stay there.</P>
    <P>Many issues will be raised during the by-elections, the most important of which must be unemployment.  It is interesting to note that in the three years up to last August unemployment in Cork rose by 7 per cent.  In Limerick and Waterford the figures declined by 5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. The reason the figure has risen so high in Cork is that Cork does not have any clout at the Cabinet table.  While Farranfore Airport has received generous grants for marketing and development Cork Airport has received absolutely nothing.</P>

      <P>No doubt it will receive something because of the by-elections. Suddenly in the middle of the heating season when householders have bought fuel and suppliers have bought stocks a ban on coal is announced.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the famous incinerator and refer journalists and others to the headlines which appeared in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in 1991 and early 1992. One such headline read &ldquo;Harney clashes with Smith about the need for incinerator&rdquo;.  If one was to read those articles one would see what the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, thought of the idea that Deputy Batt O'Keeffe thought the incinerator should be located in Cork South Central, that he told the Seanad that would lead to the creation of thousands of jobs and that it was the then Minister of State, Deputy Harney, who had lost the run of herself in preventing the creation of these jobs.  I hope the Minister will remind those gentlemen of their record on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about the honeymoon in Tinakilly yesterday.  Deputy McManus spoke about the beauty of County <Col N="2244" /> Wicklow, particularly for the one day honeymoon but the confetti has been flowing to Cork since the Government decided to hold the by-elections.  Minister after Minister has trotted down, with a little here and a little there but the people of Cork will not be fooled. They know that this Government does not deserve an extra seat; it does not need it.  It has a 35 seat majority in this Dáil and we know the way it treats it.  It would not allow questions to the Taoiseach or Ministers about the Beef Tribunal or about so many other issues. The Taoiseach simply throws up his hands in the air and refuses to answer. That, it seems, is considered an acceptable way to behave.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach referred to his being remunerated at the rate of £3 an hour.  That was funny and amusing but what was more funny was that it was first announced on radio by the General Secretary of Fianna Fáil and repeated by the Taoiseach and several of his backbenchers in the Dáil, not one of whom had the wit to get their calculators out, never mind to use their brain, and realise that the figure was wrong. This is how we found ourselves caught in the £8 billion bag and in the mess about the amnesty and so many other issues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely important that the voters of Cork vote as often as possible&mdash; as they used to say in other places &mdash; and that they turn out to vote.  Many are so disgusted they may feel there is no point when the Government has such a huge majority.  The voters in Cork North-Central and in Cork South-Central have an opportunity to teach this Government a lesson and to send them a strong message that they are fed up with the childish tantrums being thrown <Col N="2247" /> by the two most senior politicians, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  The rest of the country does not have this chance but the people of those two constituencies have an opportunity to teach this Government a lesson and make it clear that they have had enough by voting for candidates of Opposition parties.  I do not believe that this is the forum to praise one's own candidates but my party is contesting vigorously both constituencies and we will be standing on our record and on our unique policies on unemployment, tax reform, accountability in public office and some of the other issues to which I referred earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The by-elections in these two constituencies are being held for different reasons.  The by-election in Cork North-Central is being held under tragic circumstances on the death of our committed and courageous colleague, the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, whose death is a sad loss to his colleagues, constituents and his family.  The by-election in Cork South-Central is due to the resignation of the former Deputy Pat Cox who has become a member of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The democratic process dictates that we must hold these by-elections.  A Dáil seat is not our property but the gift of our bosses, the electorate.  A seat is similar to a library book and public representatives must surrender their seat after a maximum of five years or on death and the electorate must then lend it for a period.  Cork has gone through a traumatic and worrying time in recent weeks.  During the crisis in Irish Steel not a Minister was to be seen, but once the matter was resolved and the by-election campaign got under way, flocks of Ministers, and I use that word because now they usually fly to Cork, have descended on Cork in the past weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> The Taoiseach, fresh from his adventures abroad, consented to travel to Cork to see the country football final which conveniently happened to coincide with the Fianna Fáil conventions that evening.</P>
    <P>I forecast that Cork city will be the beneficiary of many promises and commitments, grants and formal openings during the next number of weeks. Already we have had proposed solutions to problems of many years, for example the announcement of incinerators closing in two of our hospitals last week and the report published today&mdash; obviously leaked &mdash; that the planned sewage treatment plant for Little Island may be moved further down to an area owned by a semi-State company.  I will believe that when I see it.</P>
    <P>The people of Cork are a sensitive, sensible level-headed people who will not be fooled by political patronisation over the coming weeks.  They will remember this Government's neglect and abandonment of Cork in recent years.  As Deputy Harney said, there are 20,000 people looking for work and areas of my constituency on the north side of the city have the highest percentage of unemployment in the country. The lack of Government funding has led to the disintegration of many of our city streets and quay walls.  There are now fewer garda on the streets to combat rising crime in our city.  There are 2,500 families on the local authority housing waiting list and Cork is experiencing the most serious housing crisis in decades.  The airport in our second largest city is not being given adequate funding to market itself.  There is also a shortage of places in UCC and in Cork regional technical college which has led to undue pressure on students and parents alike.  The future of Collins Barracks and Ballincollig Barracks is uncertain because of threatened Government cut backs.  Why has all this happened? Simply because Cork has not had a senior Minister in Cabinet since 1987. We have had the taxation of unemployment benefit and the dirty dozen social welfare cut backs at the same time as <Col N="2249" /> the scandal of the tax amnesty.  Where are the priorities?</P>
    <P>The housing problem in Cork has become more serious this week as a result of the Government's U-turn on the sale of flats under the tenant purchase scheme.  This has crushed the hopes of hundreds of Cork Corporation tenants but I will be dealing with this in more detail on the adjournment this evening.  The Government has treated the women of Cork North-Central and of Cork South-Central in a shabby way. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has consistently denied them arrears of social welfare payments. These women were faced with a veil of secrecy and a wall of silence in their efforts to get their entitlements.  Now that the by-elections have been called I hope they will see a resolution of that problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moving of the writs for the by-elections in Cork North-Central and in Cork South-Central because I believe the Government is in for a rude awakening as it exits from its cocoon of power privilege into the real world.  It will be brought down to earth in its efforts to secure votes in Cork North-Central.  The Ministers will be brought back to reality on the doorsteps when they canvass for votes.  I am convinced that the Government will receive a double hammer blow with the rejection of its candidates.  The people of Cork are sick of jobs for the boys, the massive pay increases for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who are frequently absent from the country, the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry, the passports for sale and the fight over judicial appointments, with the leaders not talking to each other, not trusting each other and ignoring industrial disputes. The list goes on and on.</P>
    <P>People will vote for Fine Gael because we are the party that has taken chances.  We have taken chances in the industrialisation of the country as well as on the northern problem.  This party <Col N="2250" /> stands for decent standards in politics, unlike the sleaze&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am asking the people of Cork to vote for the Fine Gael Party candidates because we are the only party who can give this Government a real message and provide an alternative Government at the next general election.  I am asking people to give their support to Colum Burke and Hugh Coveney on 10 November.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lowry and I have been asked to direct the Fine Gael campaigns in Cork South-Central and North-Central and over the past three to four weeks I have spent a great deal of time in Cork.  I have been very struck by the issues on the ground.  There is no doubt that Cork, a very proud city which considers itself to be the heart of the country, feels neglected since 1987 when Deputy Barry was its last Cabinet Minister.  In many respects, whether in housing lists, priority for education or health facilities, there is a feeling that Cork has been abandoned.  There is an absolute belief that this Government does not deserve an increased majority on 10 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are proud that we have proposed two outstanding candidates.  Hugh Covency is a former Member of this House and is very well known in Cork.  In Cork North-Central we are proposing Colum Burke, a young married solicitor who has lived all his life in Cork.  He is a very sincere <Col N="2251" /> and warm man who will get first preference votes from all parties in this election.  Fine Gael is the only party with two seats in this five seat constituency and is well placed to win.</P>
    <P>In addition to the local issues, so clearly articulated in this debate, there is an overwhelming sense of resentment and anger among the ordinary people. In any pub or workplace one finds that the people seriously resent this Cabinet. They resent the £2.5 million per year we are paying to cronies and relatives in positions of programme managers, special advisers and for the office of the Tánaiste that never before existed.</P>
    <P>That resentment grew with the unprecedented and extraordinary level of international travel by the Government. Spin doctors have been turned into spend doctors.  The Cabinet has cocked a snoot at taxpayers and yesterday we witnessed the group therapy session in Tinakilly where the Cabinet decided to make up.  Its members came out of their meeting gushing with enthusiasm for another three years of office.  They dined on home made venison sausage followed by warm tartlets of wild mushrooms and sorbet of passion fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This Cabinet knows no bounds in its disdain and contempt for the taxpayer and when we add up the unprecedented 1,000 hours flown by the Government jet over the past year &mdash; at a cost of £5 million &mdash; and the unnecessary worldwide travel in so many cases, it comes to in excess of £10 million before we take into consideration the pay increases.  That is £10 million that no other Government has spent simply <Col N="2252" /> to maintain this Government's champagne and caviar lifestyle.  What we did not see on the menu was the wine list because, as usual, it was Bollinger champagne to wash down the diet for this Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I was not surprised that none of the Labour Party members came into this House last week to defend the astronomical pay increases to members of the Government but the people of Cork, in conjunction with the rest of the people, are shocked at the hardship the Government has imposed on them in stark contrast to what it is doing for itself.  For the first time, unemployment benefit is being taxed.  Seasonal and part-time workers and people on low pay, with their wives working, are having their unemployment benefit taxed. VHI and mortgage relief has been restricted to the standard rate.  Pay related benefit has been abolished for unemployed people, a collective cut of £28.50 per week.  The residential property tax net has been widened.  For ordinary people working in State industry, it is job cuts and pay cuts but for this Cabinet it is only the best in extravagance and opulence and the people feel now is the time to stop the gravy train, now is the time to send this Government a message that enough is enough.</P>
      <P>The socialist principle on which this Government sought election and on which the Labour Party said it would put justice into economics and trust into politics has been betrayed.  People are waiting for the 94 D black Mercedes to roll up and for Ministers to knock on their doors.  They will have their answer. I look forward on 11 November &mdash; be it in the Neptune Stadium or elsewhere&mdash; to cheering home Colum Burke and Hugh Coveney as new TDs of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>When by-elections occurred in Mayo West and Dublin South Central, both Government parties did everything within their power to obstruct the holding of those elections, including voting down the moving of the writ on two occasions.  As a result, the people of Mayo West and Dublin South Central were left without the representation of that additional Deputy for a period of 18 months.</P>
      <P>On this occasion it appears the Government calculates it is in its political interest to facilitate the moving of the writs today.  On the previous occasion, 18 May, we witnessed the bravado of the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, as he whistled past the graveyard and said: &ldquo;We will be back here with two new Deputies after June 9&rdquo;. The Government took a hammering, the Labour vote collapsed in Dublin South Central and the Fianna Fáil vote plummeted to an unprecedented low in Mayo West.</P>
      <P>That spectacular success in Mayo West and by my colleague.  Deputy Byrne, in Dublin South Central will be repeated on this occasion.  I expect Opposition candidates to take both seats in Cork and I am confident that my colleague, Kathleen Lynch, will be successful in Cork North Central.  She is a formidable candidate, a local councillor with an outstanding record who knows and understands the problems facing the people in Cork.  Her remarkable performance in the European election, where she won 20 per cent of the vote in Cork city, was a tribute to her growing political stature.  She did sterling work, referred to by Deputy Allen, in championing the cause of tens of thousands of women who were denied arrears of social welfare.  Although the European Court decided they were entitled to those arrears payment was obstructed by the Minister Deputy Woods and the Minister of State Deputy Burton.  Kathleen Lynch has foiled the attempt to draw a veil of silence around the issue.  The people of Cork and the Dáil need representatives like her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> These by-elections come at an appropriate time as they will give the people of Cork city an opportunity to give a verdict on the bloated self importance of this Government.  Some people believed that the defeats in Dublin South Central and Mayo West would have taught the Government a lesson and urged it to get its act together.  In fact, the performance of the Government has disintegrated since the by-election defeats in Mayo West and Dublin South Central.  Only the prospect of a serious loss of seats and a loss of power caused the parties to pull back from a general election on an issue, the significance of which they never attempted to explain to the electorate. Were it not for the collective nervous breakdown on the back benches of the Labour Party, which led to their retreat at Tinakilly yesterday, there would have been a general election.</P>

      <P>That was the state of the parties at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party failed to assert its identity on issues that the people understand, issues that concern people.  For example, it combined with Fianna Fáil to obstruct and prevent women obtaining their arrears of entitlements on social welfare as permitted by the European Court of Justice and forced those women to resort to the courts to vindicate their entitlements.  The Minister for Education refused to publish the report of de Buitléir outlining the extent of the discrimination against the children of PAYE workers in higher education grants.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, has refused to deal with the housing crisis and tells us he is more concerned with drawing the line for urban renewal sites in Longford and elsewhere.  These are major issues in Cork city.  A research report prepared for the EU recently showed there are large concentrations in Cork North-Central where up to 70 per cent of people are unemployed.  Participation <Col N="2255" /> rates in higher education are virtually negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but not to tackle the serious discrimination in the higher education grant scheme as it stands. Privilege is still transmitted through education and the Government, despite its fine words, has done nothing to make that more accessible to ordinary people. Meanwhile, not just in Cork but throughout the country thousands of women are forced to join the organisation Kathleen Lynch founded, &ldquo;Women for Equality&rdquo;, to vindicate their rights in respect of social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>The performance of the Fianna Fáil element of Government is lamentable. The Taoiseach has quite properly been accorded kudos for his involvement in the peace initiative but that cannot isolate him from accountability in other matters.  He shamefully embarked upon exploiting the harvest of the peace initiative by attempting to provoke a geneal election when he thought he saw within his grasp the prospect of an overall majority.  The report of the beef tribunal showed him in a light which questions his fitness to hold Cabinet office.  The findings of the tribunal only served to exacerbate public concern already expressed in respect of serving Cabinet Ministers to make a decision that conferred substantial benefit on the family enterprise in which the Taoiseach is the main shareholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the urban renewal scheme is the biggest legal source of political patronage in the country and yields far more in financial contributions to the coffers of Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil fund-raisers in the <Col N="2256" /> United States which the Taoiseach usually attends at public expense but which he claims are rarely the primary purpose of such transatlantic visits.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter or relative of the Taoiseach in Longford from Larry Goodman to the recently appointed chairman of Aer Rianta, Noel O'Hanlon, who does not stand to be a potential beneficiary from the precision with which the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, drew the lines on the urban renewal scheme in Longford.</P>
    <P>The House has already accepted that at £3 an hour the Taoiseach works a lot of hours.  Judging from extracts from a new biography of the Taoiseach by journalist Tim Ryan which were hidden away in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, it appears that, as a Minister, the Taoiseach did not put in all those hours in the interests of the taxpayer and the public alone.  These extracts raise further questions about the reliability of claims made by him that he had nothing to do with the day-to-day running of his family business, C &amp; D Foods, since being appointed a Government Minister.  Speaking in Portlaoise on 2 June the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I have, as is required, an arm's length relationship with the company since I look up ministerial office so I cannot be accountable for and have no knowledge of its day-to-day business decisions&rdquo;.  However, the book by Tim Ryan quotes documentary evidence to show that the Taoiseach was very much involved in the day-to-day affairs of the company during 1981 and 1982 when he was a Minister.  Such involvement would clearly have been in conflict with the guidelines for Ministers.  I have a copy of a letter which is clear documentary evidence of the Taoiseach's involvement.  On 28 June 1992 a letter signed &ldquo;Albert Reynolds&rdquo; to Norman Spence, Esq., Mountain House, North Berg., Pembrokeshire, Wales shows the Taoiseach having a hand in the day-to-day running and management of the company. Around that time another Minister, Deputy Collins, was dismissed because <Col N="2257" /> of his involvement in his business which was going down the tubes yet the Taoiseach denies any knowledge of this.</P>
    <P>The decline in standards would have provoked outrage if Deputy Spring were on this side of the House.  He would have been first to demand an explanation from the Taoiseach and to demand his resignation if an acceptable explanation was not forthcoming.  It is an example of how Labour has lost all sense of direction and touch with its voters and many of its members.  The senior Labour ranks have grown flabby on a lifestyle of executive jets, Mercedes cars, expensive dinners at Tinakilly House, a legion of advisers, handlers and programme managers, all paid for by the taxpayer.  The party that was a pitbull terrier in Opposition has turned out to be a toothless lap dog in Government.  It will take more than a therapy session at Tinakilly House to restore the purpose of this Government but the people of Cork can and will make a contribution to that process.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the by-election in Cork North-Central has been caused by the sad death of Gerry O'Sullivan.

The Cork people's assessment of the difference between rhetoric and reality and the way they react to the Government line will be evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the closure of the two hospital incinerators.  The Minister's decision not to proceed with the central incinerator is also welcome.  I hope his decision was deeply rooted and not taken because a by-election was in the <Col N="2258" /> offing.  However, it shows that by-elections are good for bringing about a change in direction.  I am sure the 20,000 people in Cork waiting for good news on their employment prospects will make the news, like their colleagues in Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Jane Power will stand for the Green Party in Cork North-Central.  She has come through UCC student politics and I know she will be well received on the national scene as she is known and liked in her constituency.</P>
    <P>The Cork South-Central by-election was created by a far more complicated and unusual set of circumstances.  It was caused by a difference of opinion over the dual mandate.  Deputy Cox probably understood the difficulties of trying to deal with that while Deputy Harney may only have understood the principle and not the difficulties.  It is difficult to take a stand on the dual mandate and follow it through when one's colleagues are oblivious of the need to do so.  The consensus in the Green Party is to have a period of preparation so that the new incumbent would be well prepared to take the seat.  It is unfortunate that did not happen from the Progressive Democrats point of view but other parties seek to benefit from its misfortune.  The Government had several opportunities to deal with this problem and it is a pity it did not do so.  If it had dealt with it perhaps the Progressive Democrats Party would not be in the position in which it now finds itself.</P>
    <P>Councillor Dan Boyle will stand for the Green Party in the Cork South-Central constituency.  Given his candacy in the European elections, he is well known to the people of Cork.  While he did not secure a seat then, the number of votes he received proves he is well respected and very popular in his area. I look forward to him and Jane Power joining me in this House.  I will not ask the parties in the House to support him but I hope other parties will.</P>

      <P>I support the moving of the writs for the two by-elections in <Col N="2259" /> Cork.  The vacancy in Cork North-Central arose on the very sad and distressing death of my good friend Gerry O'Sullivan who was loved by his family, friends and constituents.  He served the people of Cork extremely well and in the fine tradition of the Labour Party and other public representatives for the area he put Cork city above politics.</P>
      <P>One of the notable features of this debate is the infrequent reference to Cork city and the lack of attention to what the people of Cork really want. We have had a generalised debate on issues which have been repeatedly rehashed in the House, for example, the beef tribunal and the passports affair. As the second person from Cork to contribute to the debate, I regard the contributions of other speakers as somewhat arrogant and very ill informed in terms of what my constituents and the people of Cork want.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the leadership row in the Progressive Democrats was the first step towards the vacancy in Cork South-Central.  It was also the beginning of the end for Pat Cox in Dáil <Col N="2260" /> Éireann who could no longer be a member of the Progressive Democrats because of a breach of trust and lack of communication with him; he was not told about the leadership election and members of the party went behind his back.

    <P>The people of Cork are fed up with that type of hypocrisy.  They would have preferred to have heard today what the parties opposite propose to give them, their policies and initiatives and how they propose to drive Cork city forward into the next century.  We have a programme and have delivered on our promises.  A previous speaker said the last Cork Minister was Deputy Peter Barry and someone referred to the &ldquo;defining moment&rdquo; for this Government.  For the people of Cork, in terms of the best party, that realisation occurred immediately prior to the 1987 general election when the Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, in addressing a dinner marking the anniversary of Cork Airport could not give even £1 million for the runway.  That was the moment the people of Cork realised which party <Col N="2262" /> would be better in Government.  Since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1987, £30 million has been spent in structural investment in Cork Airport which is now recognised by Aer Rianata and others as a gem.</P>

Where will they cut back in terms of UCC, regional technical college, City of Cork vocational education committee, second level schools, primary schools and special needs education?  It is about time the Progressive Democrats came clean on these issues and stopped hiding behind the phrase &ldquo;cuts in public expenditure&rdquo;.  Democratic Left showed its concern for the voters of Cork South-Central, it simply ditched them and said it was not interested in running in Cork South Central any longer but would go to Cork North-Central.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3b:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Each member of the staff shall be furnished with a personal guarantee signed by or on behalf of the Minister covering all guarantees to each transferee, including the right to return to the public service in the event of the failure of the new employer.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was raised in the Seanad <Col N="2272" /> and rejected by the Minister, but clarification is needed in regard to the status of the staff who will be transferred to the private sector.  On Second Stage in the Dáil the Minister stated that safeguards will apply in relation to their terms and conditions of employment, including, in certain circumstances, a right to return to employment in the public sector.  From reading the Official Report of the proceedings in the Seanad, it is my understanding that people who get into difficulties in the private sector &mdash; perhaps their businesses do not succeed &mdash; will be free to go back into the public sector.  A guarantee in that regard would clarify the matter and ensure that workers are protected.  While this has been the subject of considerable negotiation, the Minister's speech did not give such a guarantee.  He stated that workers would have a right to return to work in the public sector only in certain circumstances.  It is not appropriate for him to avoid this issue when there is a reasonable way to accommodate such a commitment in the Bill.  If this is not a reasonable amendment, will the Minister explain why and what he means by the term &ldquo;in certain circumstances&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply to this amendment.  It is my understanding that the 70 or so employees of the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards who may be transferred to the private sector if the AI, milk recording and mastitis control section is sold as a going concern are guaranteed letters of comfort about future employment.  If their jobs in the private sector do not last they will be reabsorbed into the public sector.  Will the Minister confirm that if they have not already received such letters of comfort they will do so shortly, that their unions are satisfied that the protracted negotiations, which went on for nearly three years, have been satisfactorily concluded and that no ends are left to be tied up?  If the Minister is not prepared to accept Deputy McManus's amendment, will he confirm that the <Col N="2273" /> unions are satisfied with what has been agreed?</P>

      <P>That is a matter to which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, referred in your contribution, but you must now remain neutral.  Employees in the milk industry are concerned about this matter.  Lengthy negotiations have taken place and I hope agreement can be reached.  I understand that an element of agreement has been reached, but it is appropriate that we should have confirmation of that agreement so that those who have given long and loyal service to the industry are not forgotten and receive adequate compensation or options for further employment.  Will the Minister bring us up to date on the position of the employees following this rationalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation was introduced in the Oireachtas several years ago.  I gave a commitment then that I would not proceed with it until the staff, through their unions, were satisfied that they had a satisfactory agreement.  Earlier this year a satisfactory agreement was reached.  The rights of the transferring staff are set out in an agreement reached between the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance and representatives of the staff under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  The agreement contains several pages and is supplemented by numerous appendices and other explanatory documents.  Only those aspects of the agreement which require statutory authority for implementation have been taken into account in the Bill.  As the guarantee sought does not require statutory authority, there is no need to include a reference to it in the Bill.  However, I will put on record the relevant section of the agreement.  All members of staff will receive letters in relation to the agreement in the next few weeks.  In regard to the guarantee of redeployment in the public sector, the official side guarantees that if the transferred employees are compulsorily made redundant within the <Col N="2274" /> meaning of the redundancy payments Acts they will be redeployed forthwith in the public sector.  Prior to the transfer, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will furnish to each employee transferring to the new enterprise a formal written undertaking that in the event of his or her being made redundant, redeployment in the public sector, as specified at section 4.3 of the agreement will be among the options open to him or her.  The names and grades of all transferring employees will be registered in the personnel division in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>This agreement was reached to the satisfaction of all the staff employed, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  For that reason it is unnecessary to include selective provisions of the agreement in the legislation.  As that might lead to confusion and suspicion, I must reject the amendment.  I again confirm that I will send a letter to each employee confirming what I have just put on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that people are satisfied with the principle that they can come back into the public sector, but that might not hold if a new Minister is appointed or the board decides it is not satisfied with the agreement.  It would then be necessary to have new negotiations.</P>
      <P>If this is a cast-iron guarantee there is no reason the Minister should not include it in the provisions of the Bill.  That would clear up the doubts of workers who are concerned, not about the fact that the agreement has been made, but that it is not inserted in the Bill.  I commend the Minister for his efforts in reaching this agreement, but it is illogical to claim that it cannot be inserted in the Bill.  That would reassure people for the future as well as for the present.</P>

They had all the time in the world to negotiate and reach agreement and they did so earlier this year.  They communicated that agreement to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, allowing me introduce the Bill.  To copperfasten the matter I have put the relevant section of the agreement on the record. Adequate gilt edged guarantees have been given to the staff about future employment and people should not be concerned in that regard.</P>

      <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  The Agency shall promote the sale by processors of heat-treated liquid milk in returnable containers by&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2276" /> (a) setting targets for the proportion of heat-treated liquid milk to be sold in such containers, and</P>
    <P>(b) monitoring the achievement of such targets by processors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because it is time we faced up to the waste mountain building up, not just in Ireland, but right across Europe.  The establishment of the National Milk Agency affords us an opportunity to take responsibility for what happened in relation to liquid milk and containers used at present.  In the past, generally milk was sold in bottles which were environmentally friendly, reusable 20 or 30 times, the kind of containers that people who are concerned about the environment are now promoting very heavily and are now acceptable across Europe as constituting the way forward to improve environmental protection.  The establishment of the National Milk Agency affords us an opportunity to begin to work the process in the right direction.  To date all the movement has been towards disposable containers, away from reusable ones, with only 11 per cent of milk at present being sold in reusable containers.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may say responsibility lies with the Department of the Environment it is everybody's responsibility to face up to what is happening and to reduce the damage to our environment.  Unless action is taken across the board by all Departments to meet the demands of environmental protection, we will end up doing lasting damage to the world.  I tabled this amendment believing that the National Milk Agency has an opportunity and indeed obligation to set the trend.  I know the Minister for the Environment will produce a waste management Bill shortly.  Already a document has been produced on recycling strategy which says all sorts of nice things but does not stipulate how the goals will be achieved. I recommend that the Minister adopts this approach, a very modest proposal, that the agency be given responsibility <Col N="2277" /> to promote the sale of milk in returnable containers thereby setting targets for the industry.  Again, this cannot be done by legislation only or imposing penalties; it must be done by agreement, on the part of processors in particular, by the retail segment of the industry, because the present interests of the retail sector in particular is to get rid of bottles, simply creating the waste mountain to which I referred earlier.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy McManus because, with the exception of one of the Dublin dairies, most dairies and distributors distribute packaged milk, in plastic or Tetrapak containers and some of them have spent massive amounts of money installing the type of equipment necessary for such containers, most of which are disposable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Delivering milk in glass bottles is cumbersome and from the point of view of hygiene Tetrapaks are preferable.  I would go so far as to say it would be a retrograde step to deliver milk bottles which are returnable and necessitate washing, bearing in mind breakage and general damage.  Indeed in windy weather in Dublin milk roundsmen experience difficulty with milk bottles falling or rolling about. Therefore, I do not think one can compel the use of milk bottles against other types of containers, particularly when it will have cost some dairies and distributors so much to install the requisite equipment for the latter.</P>

      <P>I reject this amendment for a number of reasons.  It is not the purpose of this Bill to promote any particular type of package for milk.  While I appreciate her concern about the protection of the environment and the conservation of natural resources, this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for addressing such issues.</P>
      <P>Glass bottles are very nice in many ways as one can see that the milk contains a certain percentage of butter fat, which was very useful in the old days when the skimming of milk was practised by some operators.  However, they also have shortcomings.  Deputy McManus spoke on Second Stage about a roundsman getting perhaps 20 or 25 trips per bottle.  While some people may be very good at returning bottles, and, while some might well wash the bottles properly, others might not.  In addition, those bottles were used from time to time for holding liquids other than milk. For example, I well recall holidaymakers leaving them beneath caravans, mobile homes, when they grew mould and propagated insects.  Indeed automatic washing systems in plants were not terribly good at getting snails out of bottles and consumers regularly became ill because of foreign bodies in milk bottles resulting from perhaps one trip too many.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage Deputy McManus said it would be very useful to have long-life milk.  Of course, modern packages lend themselves to long-life milk and cream.  Deputy Leonard would know all about it because Killeshandra pioneered that project. There is one further shortcoming to the use of milk bottles, which is that in the case of doorstep deliveries, the tops in aluminium foil constitute a polluter. Birds, who rise earlier than householders, have a habit of picking the foil tops off the milk bottles and helping themselves to a fair protion of the most lucrative part, the cream at the top.</P>

      <P>We should avoid ambiguity.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the regulation of milk supply in the Twenty-Six counties. Given the provisions of that section and the concept of the registration of contracts in the next section &mdash; which I fully support and which is perhaps one of the most important sections in the Bill &mdash; how will we regulate milk supply if in the spirit of free trade in the European Union and the single market it is perfectly legal to import milk from any member country, although in practice it would be imported only from the North of Ireland?  What provisions exist to prevent milk, including milk for manufacturing purposes, being imported from the North?  As long as it meets the necessary quality criteria it can be used in liquid milk supply, particularly in the winter months when there is a scarcity or a temporary hiccup in supply in an area.  While hours and years of work have gone into the preparation of this Bill &mdash; this is the third attempt to introduce such a Bill in four years &mdash; we still do not have any control over the importation of milk.  How can the provisions in section 5 governing the regulation of milk supply and the registration of contracts for milk supply which we will discuss in the next section be squared with the reality of the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disturbed to be told by the ICMSA, one of the main producer groups, that in its view the Bill will not work.  I was taken aback at that because I understood we all agreed that, with the exception of a few detailed amendments, the Bill would be in everybody's best interest.  It is not that the ICMSA does not support the introduction of this Bill.  It does not consider it will not work because we do not have control over milk being imported from the North into the South.  It will not be possible to stop the milk being used whether for manufacturing or liquid milk supply as long as it meets the quality criteria.  The contract business is negated if milk can be imported willy nilly from across the <Col N="2282" /> Border.  In the South there is a prohibition on buying milk from manufacturers.  This Bill will tie that down very tightly, but we cannot prohibit the buying of milk from manufacturers across the Border.  If we cannot control the flow of milk from manufacturers in the North to liquid milk suppliers in the South what is the point in pretending that we are controlling the position by registering contracts and the regulation of milk supply?  I am somewhat concerned about those matters.</P>
    <P>Importers from the North could abuse their dominant position when a minimum price order is not in place and the Competition Act has removed price controls on the sale of milk in supermarkets.  If importers from the South can buy milk from the North for manufacturing purposes in times of scarcity to supplement their liquid milk supply, assuming it meets the quality criteria, that milk could then be sold at a cheaper price per litre on the supermarket shelves than milk manufactured for consumption in the South through the liquid milk supply system.  There is a great anomaly in this area which I have not yet heard addressed.  Because of the extra costs of liquid milk production I understand the necessity to tie liquid milk processors to liquid milk producers, but in times of scarcity will they not seek out manufacturing producers in the North to augment their supply?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure an adequate supply of milk to consumers in our cities and towns.  It is proposed to do so by drawing up a contract between the liquid milk producers and processors or a liquid milk bottling plant.  That contract will have to have regard to the production of milk all the year round, particularly in the winter months when milk tends to be more scarce and producers or milk suppliers will have to be adequately compensated for its production.  There is not any real difficulty about milk being imported from the North of Ireland, the UK or European countries to ensure urban supplies.  However, there is a <Col N="2283" /> problem for our processors and our farmers even though we are part of the single European market.  We export 80 per cent of the milk we produce in products, such as butter, powder and casein and various ingredients.  If we export 80 per cent of what we produce we cannot very well put a barrier against imports. However, as we have an efficient system of farm production and dairy processing, I do not have any fears about our industry at farm and processing level withstanding milk imports.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure an adequate all year round milk supply of a quality at least up to the European standard and higher if possible.  Most of our milk suppliers produce milk of a higher standard than that laid down under the European Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said in effect that there is absolutely nothing he can do about the problem of milk being imported from Northern Ireland. A large quantity of milk is utilised in the liquid milk trade without the imposition of controls.  The provisions of the Bill will not necessarily mean that farmers will be guaranteed a reasonable price for their milk when it can be imported from elsewhere.  This is a serious problem, especially in the Border counties where the marketing structure can be undermined.  Under the proposed regulations in this Bill processors and farmers will be subject to another layer of bureaucracy but they do not have any guarantees.  A processor told me today that two inspectors from two different sections had called to see him and he wonders if, as a result of the passing of this legislation, more inspectors will call next week.  Yet the Bill may not benefit him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt very much if there were any inspectors out as a result of this measure because we have not processed it through the House and it has to go to the Seanad.  However, there are inspectors to ensure that the hygiene, quality and refrigeration standards on farms meet the requirements of consumers. <Col N="2284" /> We should make no apology for that. Consumers are entitled to milk of the highest standard, and they are getting it now.  Only a few weeks ago we made grant aid available to improve hygiene in premises to meet the requirements of Directive 92/46.</P>
    <P>We cannot put technical controls on milk or milk products coming into Ireland.  Quite an array of cheeses and milk products are being imported into this country from all over Europe as well as some milk from the North where some processors have links with co-operatives in the South.  Waterford and Golden Vale in particular have some involvement with co-operatives in the North.  We talk about this island we are living on and the fact that we, both in the North and South, have a common interest in these matters so there is no way that we could put a barrier on milk coming here from the North.  I have absolute confidence in the ability of our milk producers and co-operatives to cope with imports from any part of the North or from Great Britain itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is substantial movement of milk southwards for processing.  I meet the trucks on a daily basis in my constituency, bringing milk to the processing plants.  That product has been capable of competing against the Milk Marketing Board which was not as efficient as we used to think years ago.  We used to think the Milk Marketing Board was the be all and end all of everything but it was left behind by the larger co-operatives.  Would it create problems at EU level if we refused to allow a milk roundsman or milk distributor from the North to come across the Border to sell milk on the doorsteps or in supermarkets?  I can see that happening.  We are moving across the Border with our bread.  Years ago there was no such thing but now there is free movement of bread; Pat the Baker must <Col N="2285" /> be supplying most of the North at present.  That is the trend and I fear the same will happen if an opportunity arises in regard to milk distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the quality of milk, particularly milk from the North.  I raise this matter because in the mid-1980s there were many scares emanating in the Dublin area about the quality of milk.  I am glad this Bill is going through but I would like an answer from the Minister about the question of milk from outside the Republic.</P>
      <P>There is concern, because the co-operative movement is not as strong in the west, that the milk quota system might be lost to that region.  The Minister has done much under the restructuring schemes to keep milk in the western pool but there is concern about milk leaving that region going to the south and the south-east because farmers are getting out of milk for various reasons, among them being the fact that the hygiene regulations create so much expense.  I am sure the Minister supports the efforts of the co-operatives to strengthen their own base in the western region and I would like him to keep that milk quota available for other farmers who want to enlarge their quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McManus asked for an assurance that the quality of imported milk would be up to standard.  I can so confirm.  Under Directive 92/46 all milk throughout the European Union will have to be up to that minimum standard and all the packs, trucks and containers will have to have that guarantee stamped on them.  The vast majority of Irish producers are way ahead of that standard in terms of the various bacteriological requirements. There is, therefore, a guarantee of the quality of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of milk leaking from the west is a matter for regulation and does not come within the terms of this Bill. However, the matter is being taken in <Col N="2286" /> hand.  In fact, some people in the southern part of the country not too far from myself helped themselves to quotas in recent times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>SECTION 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2) (a), line 33, after &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;,however, where a producer accidentally fails to meet the said quality standards, the contract shall provide for a reasonable period for recovery time to allow the producer return to the said quality standards&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that I hold no brief for anyone who abuses the system and who persistently fails to meet standards rightfully demanded by the consumer.  While the registration of contracts is perhaps the most important section of the Bill we must carefully handle situations where there has been a breach of contract.  A one off breach should not be treated in the same way as systematic breaches of the required standards.  That is why I ask the Minister to consider inserting this clause to <Col N="2287" /> cover the case of a producer accidentally and exceptionally failing to meet quality criteria of one kind or another. That producer should be given a reasonable time to recover his or her normal standards without having his or her contract systematically terminated.  We should distinguish between the one off situations or accidents and cases where people just flout the standards and refuse to meet criteria of one kind or another.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract between the milk producer and the dairy is a commercial matter beyond the remit of the new agency.  The agency will register only those contracts which specify quality and hygiene standards at least equal to those provided under European Union Directive 92/46.  The setting of higher quality standards is a matter between the producer and the dairy. The quality standards under Directive 92/46 in so far as they relate to total bacterial count and somatic cell count levels in milk allow for a recovery period of two to three months.  Earlier this year I published details of how these standards would apply in practice and the arrangements I put in place then were, by and large, acceptable to the dairy industry while fully protecting the interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that this Bill is not setting the quality standards of milk.  It relates only to the supply of milk to consumers and regular supply, particularly in winter, and provides that supply must conform to existing European Union quality standards.  While I understand the reason for Deputy Doyle's proposal I cannot agree to the amendment on the basis that the matter is not appropriate to the function of the milk agency and therefore is not relevant here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers dealing in liquid milk over the years were generally paid a little extra for their milk and kept their premises up to a very high standard.  In practice there is little difficulty in this area. However, if there was a wedding or a <Col N="2288" /> wake in the house there might be nobody to milk the cows except a stranger or a young person and the milk arriving at the creamery might not be up to standard.  In those circumstances there would be no option but to reject the milk as it could not be passed to the consumers, who would not get it until the following day or perhaps two days later.  Nowadays people expect milk to last for four or five days.  We cannot tolerate sending sour or contaminated milk to dairies.  Contaminated milk usually goes into the animal feed system when it is returned to the farmer.  It is most unusual for this problem to arise and it is expected that milk is of the required standard.  Almost all dairies employ a milk quality adviser who calls to the farmer if there is a problem with the milk supplied.  He inspects the milking parlour for a breakdown in the system.  Consumers must be protected in this matter and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I was not understood to suggest that milk produced during a breakdown in quality control should be passed on to the consumer.  I was referring to the contractual position, the effect of a once-off breach in standards and how much time would elapse before the contractual relationship was restored.  We should distinguish between the unsuitability of a person to hold a contract to supply liquid milk and a once-off breach in a case such as that given by the Minister &mdash; my amendment proposes to address that aspect.  If, as the Minister stated, it is a matter that cannot be addressed under the Bill but is a matter for European regulation or one to be sorted out by the agency and those involved, I accept that.  However there are concerns among producers &mdash; farmer groups have come to me with concerns about this aspect &mdash; that the habitual transgressor of contractual requirements is treated in the same way as the unfortunate person who experiences a once-off breakdown in quality control.  There is a need to protect the producer with the once-off <Col N="2289" /> difficulty as distinct from the person who continuously causes trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason for the Deputy's amendment but I expect that matter would be attended to in drawing up the agreement between the farmer and the dairy.  If there is a crisis in a family and a person makes a mistake he could hardly be thrown out of the creamery for that reason. However the position is different in the case of a persistent careless defaulter who has no interest in the final destination of the product.  I expect this will be dealt with in the agreement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7b:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Minister or the Agency may specify the minimum price to be paid to producers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I propose to enable the Minister or the agency to specify the minimum price to be paid to producers. I suspect the Minister will quote the Competition Act and various regulations dealing with this matter.  There is concern, particularly in the scenario we discussed in the previous sections, that if manufacturing milk from the North, which is much cheaper than liquid milk, can be brought South and used in liquid milk processing and in producing milk drinks it can hit the supermarket shelves at a cheaper price than the higher cost &mdash; for understandable and acceptable reasons &mdash; milk produced and processed in the South.  That point has been put to me to protect processors and to ensure that we avoid the abuse of a dominant position generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be an enabling measure whereby the Minister or the agency could fix a minimum price for milk.  I would like the Minister's views on that matter.  It is not in the interests of the <Col N="2290" /> consumer to have a price war if at the end of it people are driven out of liquid milk production and the stability of a 12 month supply, particularly in urban areas, is upset.  I envisage a great problem with manufacturing milk from the North coming to the South, enabling the litre of milk to be sold at a cheaper rate in our supermarkets, particularly in the northern parts of the country.  Perhaps my amendment could be accepted in some form to provide an enabling measure whereby, if necessary, a minimum price could be put on the litre of milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The milk agency will seek to ensure an adequate supply of milk to consumers all year round.  It was not envisaged that the agency would fix a minimum price.  The reason the old milk boards were abolished was that the European Union found their mode of operation contrary to European Union law.  For the new agency to be so empowered would also be contrary to European competition law.  Given that it is the same body of law that caused the Commission to raise questions about the continuation of the old milk boards, it would make little sense to replace those boards with an agency which would also fall foul of the same European Union law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the conditions for the registration of a contract under the Bill is a requirement that the price stipulated provides, in the opinion of the agency, adequate compensation to the producer for raw milk supplied, taking into account in particular the cost of production during winter.  This cost may vary from one part of the State to another or even from one producer to another depending on the scale of operations.  Thus it is totally different from a statutory minimum price.  The fixing of a statutory minimum price is contrary to European Union law.  For some time people have supplied milk to Cork, Dublin, Galway or Belfast from any part of the island, there is no bar.  Traditional suppliers continue to supply milk door to door or to the supermarkets <Col N="2291" /> because we have an efficient milk industry and I have no doubt this will continue.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow registered contracts to be tradeable in their own right, independently of the transfer of business.  I welcome the provision in the Bill which will allow the transfer of contracts to a third party on the death of the owner or the transfer of ownership of the registered business. I would like the provision outlined in the amendment inserted as it would allow a registered producer to transfer ownership of contracts independently of the possible transfer of ownership of the farm or business generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This trading of contracts is currently practised, particularly in the Dublin Milk Marketing Board area, and guarantees the commitment of the dairy <Col N="2293" /> farmers involved in liquid milk production as well as the consistent quality of the milk produced.

In other words, in drawing up the agreement with their legal representatives they can insert various conditions but it is not envisaged that the agency will become involved in this area of activity.  It is only when a producer has entered into a contract with a dairy that the agency will become involved and register the contract.  For this reason I reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>As time is running out I do not want to delay the House.  The reasons the Minister has given for rejecting my amendment could also be applied to subsection (2).  It is a matter for the legal representatives of the producer and the agency to agree the terms of the contract.  One could delete subsection (2) for the same reasons the Minister has given for refusing to accept the amendment.  It is important that registered contracts should be tradeable in their own right, independently of the transfer of business or the transfer of contracts on the death of the registered owner to ensure that contracts remain in the hands of those who are most qualified to produce.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where the ownership of any business carried on at registered premises has been transferred to another person, the Agency shall on the application of that person, made in such manner and form and containing such particulars as the Agency may require, insert in the appropriate register the name of that person in lieu of that of the person previously registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> I suggest that an exact template of that subsection should be added so that the contract may be transferred on the death of the registered owner or when the business is transferred and regarded as a tradeable asset in its own right.  This seems to be perfectly logical.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure the registration of contracts and the supply of milk.

      <P>&ldquo;5.  The total number of ordinary members nominated or elected by producer and consumer interests shall constitute not less than half of the total membership of the Agency.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  There is a rather curious reference in the Bill to the &ldquo;appropriate number of first ordinary members&rdquo; nominated on the advice of the various groups.  That surely is open to very broad interpretation.  While I accept the bona fides of this Minister, it is extraordinary that there is no firm structure to define what an appropriate number is.  My amendment seeks essentially what the Minister committed himself to in the Seanad when he outlined what he perceived as the appropriate number. There is no conflict between what he perceives as the appropriate number of ordinary members and what I am putting forward in my amendment relating to producers and consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy McManus.  All members other than producer members are to be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of processor, distributor, retailer and consumer interests.  We do not have time to go into what the Minister has in mind &mdash; perhaps he is thinking in terms of panels of three, ensuring that one member wears a skirt. The representatives from across the Border will be asked to keep an eye on what we are doing down here.  I do not have time to compare what the Minister has done in this Bill with other recent board appointments but there is no reason the same arrangement could not be used on a permanent basis for producer members of the agency as for all other interested parties that will be represented as members.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to lay down the relative proportion of the membership from the various interests, ensuring that producer members should constitute at least half the membership.</P>

      <P>I have had wide-ranging consultations with the various interests involved and following those consultations with producers, consumers, processors and roundsmen we have come up with this agreed solution to this problem.  It is the intention that the various interests involved in production, processing, distribution and sale of liquid milk for consumption, as well as consumers themselves will have a voice in the new agency.  However, since the balance of interest may change over time it is not considered prudent to specify the numbers or set proportions for representation of the various interests in the Bill itself.  It is considered desirable to allow for flexibility <Col N="2299" /> in the numbers representing each category.  With regard to whether producer representatives should be elected or appointed, let me say that I would prefer the democratic system.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, expressing concern at the increasing number of closures of rural and local post offices and alarmed at the serious damage being caused to the fabric of community life in rural Ireland, calls on the Government to immediately halt these closures and to reaffirm its commitment <Col N="2302" /> to maintain and preserve rural and local post offices.</P>
    <P>This motion is not meant to be divisive or self-glorifying because many, if not all, Deputies would support the sentiments expressed in this motion.  It is designed to ensure that the political will of this House, through its elected representatives, is brought to bear on the senior civil servants and heads of Departments, the people who appear to shape the policies of organisations such as An Post.  I do not wish to engage in a civil servant bashing exercise but there are salient points which need to be expressed if progress is to be made in the maintenance, preservation and rehabilitation of rural life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the last general election all political parties put forward their proposals on the basis of preserving rural life and maintaining essential services throughout the country.  This motion will give those Deputies and parties an opportunity to support a further call to that end.  I have no doubt that even those Deputies who do not have a rural base, but are urban based, will also find common ground on this issue because many local post offices in urban areas are also under threat and some have been closed.  I cite the cases in Dún Laoghaire and Little Bray in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There is an ever increasing awareness among communities throughout the country of the danger of losing their essential services.  People are now coming together and lobbying their elected representatives to create a greater awareness of the maintenance of such essential services.  The recent decision by An Post to reopen Carracastle post office in County Mayo is a salutary lesson to those in positions of power that when people unite in a just cause, the will of the people will prevail.  All our citizens have the same constitutional rights to a basic and efficient postal service.  That should serve as a compelling reminder to An Post management that there are powerful reasons for the <Col N="2303" /> retention of the present network of post offices.</P>
    <P>The usual argument advanced by An Post when a post office is closed is that such offices are non-viable.  Those in An Post who would sacrifice such offices to the altar of economic expediency would do well to remember that 300 postmasters and postmistresses receive less than £80 a week.  While I do not wish to refer to the recent débácle regarding programme managers, it is ironic that those people who, perhaps, led this country to the brink of an unwanted general election over a relatively minor issue, are paid ten times the amount a postmaster or postmistress in a sub-post office is paid.  It is difficult to explain to the public that in order to keep one programme manager, ten sub-post offices would have to be closed.</P>
    <P>People are aware of the consequences of the removal of the postal service from their community.  The bitter experience from other areas throughout the country, where post offices have closed, is evident by the desolate schools, shops and deserted houses in once thriving villages.  Post offices must be kept open to stem the haemorrhage of rural depopulation.  People are unwilling to settle in areas where basic services, which are taken for granted elsewhere, are absent.</P>
    <P>The necessity to retain the quality and universality of the present postal service is even more vital when one takes into account the blatant anti-rural telephone charges operated by Telecom Éireann.  The community is asking An Post what will happen when the sub-post offices are gone and the postmen have stopped visiting the homes of old people in rural areas.  Will the postal service in rural areas be diminished to a two or three day week service?  This could happen for monetary reasons and because top civil servants consider that their prime object is to run an efficient service which pays, and those who are unfortunate to live in an area where the service does not pay must do without.  It is our job as elected representatives to <Col N="2304" /> ensure that such a situation never evolves.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of An Post, Mr. Hynes, is on record as saying that An Post is committed to rural Ireland.  Such assurances ring hollow in the light of recent decisions by An Post to close and downgrade offices throughout the country.  Guarantees by Mr. Hynes to computerise all the offices in the network, instead of the 1,000 offices suggested in current proposals, would do much to allay people's fears and it would be a clear signal that An Post can be trusted in its commitment.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for me to reiterate why rural post offices should not be closed. Small rural and local post offices &mdash; I emphasise there are many local post offices in city areas which are under the same threat &mdash; should not be closed because they are inexpensive to run. For example, 116 offices are only paid £80 a week and out of this, the postmaster must supply a premises, heating, lighting, insurance, toilet facilities, etc. If the people who operate these offices are put on the dole, the cost to the Exchequer would be much greater.</P>
    <P>Rural post offices should not be closed because their demise would accelerate the depopulation of the rural community.  People are unwilling to settle in an area where the basic services which are taken for granted are absent. The consequences of this trend are evident.  In communities where the postal services have been removed, small schools have closed, shops and other businesses have lost much custom and in many instances, have closed down. The fact that people have to move out of their own villages to collect their pensions and entitlements means their money is spent outside of their own community.</P>
    <P>The removal of postal services from the area destroys the very spirit of local enterprise.  Clubs and associations are decimated.  Such services should not be removed at a time when European Leader funding programmes are encouraging rural community initiatives.  The closure of rural post offices <Col N="2305" /> also acts as a disincentive to outside investment.</P>
    <P>No business can operate today without a local efficient service.  Rural post offices should not be closed because they are the focal point of village life. The post office is the hub, the centre and the heart of every local community. It is a place where the elderly and lonely meet and exchange views.  A post office often gives an identity to a community. For instance, it is reasonable to expect that a postmaster or postmistress who could have 20 to 40 old age pensioners collecting their pensions weekly would be the first to know if there was something wrong with any one of them and this would have the effect of a community neighbourhood watch.</P>
    <P>The rural dweller, of course, has the same constitutional rights to a basic postal service as everyone else.  Rural dwellers do not enjoy the same proximity to essential services such as hospitals, doctors, ambulances, fire brigades, etc.  Who then has the responsibility for ensuring the conservation of our rural and local post offices?  I suggest that notwithstanding the consideration of the chief executive of An Post and the senior civil servants in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Minister, as the sole shareholder, and the politicians elected to this House, are the people who should make these decisions.  It will be a sad day indeed if pure monetary consideration dictate whether these essential services will be afforded to large areas of this country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not surprising that the groups supporting this call include such eminent bodies like Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers Association, the Irish Farmers Association, Macra na Feirme, the Leader network, the RRD in County Clare under the guidance of the eminent Fr. Harry Bohan, the National Association of the Unemployed and the General Council of County Councils, among other eminent bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2306" /> It is also a fact that it is current European Union policy &mdash; we are led by it in many Departments and on many other occasions, almost to the point of annoyance &mdash; to preserve our small rural communities and what An Post is proposing is clearly contrary to this policy.  Many Garda barracks have been closed and community welfare services have been removed from a number of our smaller centres.  If our post offices are closed, it would be the death knell for small communities.  Substantial EU funding has been received by our Government, but unfortunately very little of it has gone into preserving our small rural communities.  The proposed changes mean that no sorting or delivery of mail will be carried out in downgraded offices.</P>
    <P>The principle of making limited companies of bodies like An Post, Telecom Éireann, Coillte Teoranta, on the face of it, would seem to be a prudent way to do business.  However, when the product itself is in many cases the only basic service available to the public, one that can be manipulated and is motivated entirely on the basis of monetary competitiveness, then we must ask ourselves if we have sold the rights of our people to a company which, in many cases, has no responsibility in this regard.  The syndrome of &ldquo;If it does not pay, let's take it away and bring it to somewhere where it will&rdquo; is one which, unfortunately, is now becoming firmly established both in Government circles and in Irish life.  Telecom Éireann, for instance, is suffering from this syndrome.  In many cases, the only telephone box in many of our villages has been removed because according to the company auditor, the take from that box was not sufficient, thereby leaving the village and the community without the basic service of a telephone box.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency where many outlying areas depend on the telephone to make contact with the outside world.  Yet, if it did not pay, that facility would be removed.  It is up to us, as elected representatives, to ensure that this practice is discontinued.  The people, who are essentially the owners <Col N="2307" /> of these public utilities, the public, have a say in this matter through their elected representatives.  It seems to me that the Minister and the politicians are secondary considerations when it comes to policy making decisions in this area and hence, of course, the grave disquiet among the public.  I call on the Minister to immediately reaffirm his authority as the sole shareholder and the head of the Department with the sole responsibility for our postal services.</P>
    <P>The closure of a rural post office generates a sense of loss and a climate of gloom, frustration and hopelessness in a community.  People feel that they are left behind and, therefore, inferior.  This in turn leads to distrust of Governments who seem to sanction these decisions. Effectively, rural people feel disenfranchised and powerless.  When a post office is closed, in many cases people may have to travel up to ten miles to post even one letter.  When one considers the services provided by the local post office &mdash; a savings bank, savings and prize bonds, television and dog licences, envelopes, stamps, parcel post, postal orders, widows and retirement pensions and social welfare benefits, etc.&mdash; the enormity of the loss becomes evident.</P>
    <P>The closure of a rural post office removes from a community the postmaster or postmistress who fulfills many roles beyond the call of duty.  They can fill in forms for old people, read and write letters for illiterate people and advise the elderly of their entitlements and investments.  Larger post offices do not provide that personal service which is to be found in a small community where the postmaster or postmistress knows all their people.</P>
    <P>The closure of small post offices affects most adversely, the elderly, the disabled and those on low incomes.  For instance, where there is no local post office, a person may have to hire a taxi where there is no public transport and travel that ten miles at great expense. For instance, it could cost someone on a pension of £70 a week £8 just to get <Col N="2308" /> their weekly entitlements.  The closure of the rural post office means the irreplaceable loss of the postman who was often the only daily contact for lonely and isolated people.  As well as the mail, he brings the local news, posts their letters and acts as a communicative link between them and the community.</P>
    <P>The decision by An Post to computerise all but 800 offices is a clear indication that the notorious viability plan to target the closure of 550 post offices is still very much in place.  The rural community is now waking up to the reality that what happened in Carracastle in Mayo could well be their experience tomorrow.  Whether An Post admits it or not, the decision not to computerise up to 600 post offices is the clearest admission that these offices fill no long term future role in An Post's plans.  The irony of An Post's policy is that based on the false economic premise that smaller post offices are costing the company money, the reality is the smaller the office the less it actually costs.  As I have stated, up to 118 offices cost less than £60 per week to the company and are, in fact, often subsidised by the postmasters' or postmistresses' private business.</P>
    <P>I am calling on An Post and the Minister to publish a new dynamic and imaginative viability plan with the emphasis on viability and expansion for these 600 offices rather than their destruction and dismantlement.</P>

      <P>This Private Members' motion is most timely.  According to the latest statistics in the region of 275,000 people are unemployed in this country at the moment.  Thankfully that figure is decreasing but if the real figures for those working on FAS schemes and certain educational courses were known, perhaps that figure would be higher than 300,000.  Anyone who visits the villages of Ireland today and takes stock of the services provided there by local traders and compares them with the services and the number of people trading there 20 years ago, will realise that the people who talk about rural Ireland <Col N="2309" /> dying on its feet are not far wrong.  If that decline is accentuated by the policies of our Government, it is all the more regrettable.</P>
      <P>In 1991 a major onslaught was made on our post offices not merely on sub-post offices but also post offices in towns and employing up to ten people. However, when the extent of the opposition to that plan was realised, it was soon shelved, or so we thought. However, what appears to be happening now is that post offices are being closed by stealth.</P>
      <P>In 1993 An Post's turnover was £271.8 million and the profit accruing therefrom was £7.3 million.  Of the 1,946 sub-post offices in 1991, at the present rate of closure, there will be 1,000 fewer by the time this Government leaves office.  Some 75 per cent of An Post's total retail business is conducted in sub-post offices and in excess of 40 per cent of all sub-post office work relates to social welfare, thus giving those post offices a social significance.  From time to time we hear of the preponderance of post offices throughout Ireland and we are told that, per head of population, we have a far greater number of post offices than any other country in Europe.  We have one post office for every 1,600 people, in England there is one post office per 2,500 people and in West Germany there is one per 3,300.  It is ridiculous to compare Ireland's basically rural, agricultural economy with highly industralised countries like England and Germany which have huge centres of population.</P>
      <P>The money saved by the closure of post offices is reckoned to be in the region of £2 million to £2.5 million.  That is a paltry sum when one realises the social effects those post offices have on the rural community.  The sum of £2 million to £2.5 million from a turnover of £271.8 million is a very small figure indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of An Post is very good. Compared to our European neighbours An Post ranks third in the list of EU countries in its provision of services.  In excess of 95 per cent of all letters within <Col N="2310" /> the country are delivered by the following day.  The EU maintains that money is available from the EU for the provision of postal services in disadvantaged areas.  I do not know whether that money has been drawn down or what has happened with it but, if it is to be of any benefit to us, it is time to call on it if it is there at all.</P>

      <P>A Government committed to creating employment and consequently reducing unemployment, must recognise the contribution that an organisation like An Post makes in providing jobs.  The continued operation of sub-post offices shows An Posts belief in the decision making abilities of local staff in those post offices but if they were closed, the decision making would be taken at regional level.  The people making those decisions would be far removed from the place where such services are required and, consequently, would be providing a poor service.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the then Minister said:</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that there is no question of the Government agreeing to the unwarranted dismantling of the postal network.  I wonder if that is still the thinking of the Minister, albeit a different Minister.  In particular, I should tell the House that An Post have now informed me that it is their clear objective that the job reductions will be of a voluntary nature.</P>
      <P>I wonder if that is still the case.  The survival of An Post, according to Professor Cuddy of UCG, will require creativity and imagination.  An Post must develop new products.  Have any such products been developed and, if so, what effect are they having on the life of An Post?</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Fox on tabling his motion, to which I am happy to put my name and fully support.  The issue, as is emphasised in the <Col N="2311" /> motion, is both a local and rural one.  I think that Deputy Fox deliberately emphasised that it was local and rural because it is an issue which affects both urban and rural areas.  The Minister is quite familiar with both rural and urban areas, such as Croghan in his own constituency with which I, too, am very familiar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>However, having said that, and because I have an affinity with the Minister's area, it disappoints me particularly to see that the Government's response to this motion is, in effect, to support the policy of An Post in its closure of local and rural post offices.  I see no other way of interpreting the amendment which the Government has tabled to this motion. It will not simply be a matter of disappointment to me but also to people who have campaigned around the country, in urban and rural areas, for the retention of their post offices.</P>
      <P>In my constituency and in the nearby areas of Fairview, which I formerly represented &mdash; and I hope that it may return to my electoral area when the boundary commission gets under way in the next few weeks &mdash; and Cabra&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In both of those areas quite a strong campaign has been fought in recent times &mdash; one was successful and the other, regrettably, failed.  They are communities which fought to save what they saw as an essential part of their community.  I wish to refer briefly to the experience of both those campaigns and the meetings which Government and Opposition TDs had with senior officials of An Post when we were making the case for the retention of those post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came across to me during both campaigns that the senior executives of An Post &mdash; and, apparently now, the <Col N="2312" /> present Minister and the Government &mdash; have no interest or concern in the social impact which a post office closure can have on a very close knit community, whether urban or rural.  They are simply not interested; it is not an issue in their consideration.  It is irrelevant to their views on whether a post office should stay open or be closed. They have no interest in the impact on the many elderly people, in particular, in whose lives the post office still plays a critical role, even in urban areas.  That critical role was outlined very ably by Deputy Fox.  The sole interest of the senior executives of An Post, which appears to be paralleled by the sole interest contained in the Government's amendment, appears to be to use every opportunity presented to them to close a local post office or amalgamate neighbouring post offices.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of Cabra east, in the parish of Christ the King, which is a very large urban area with a mainly elderly community, where the threatened post office was economically viable and making a profit, the An Post executives refused to accept that fact as sufficient grounds to ensure that it would remain open.  Therefore, what chance do rural post offices which are not considered economically viable have when that is the attitude of the senior executives of An Post?</P>
    <P>In the case of Cabra, I want to pay tribute to the large local committee, comprised mainly of women, led by Mrs. Rita Mullen, who is a stalwart of the local community, which refused to accept defeat and, along with myself and other local public representatives, campaigned vigorously and succeeded in retaining a post office for that community.  If they had not fought that campaign there was no doubt in anyone's mind that An Post fully intended to remove the post office from their area.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, in the case of Fairview, despite the intervention of Government and Opposition TDs &mdash; although hypocritically, I have to say, in the case of the Government TDs in the light of the amendment which has been tabled <Col N="2313" /> to this motion.  There is no other interpretation of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The post office was closed and a focal point for generations in the Clonliffe, Ballybough, Marino and Fairview areas, across from the parish church and beside the local shops and GPs, has been seriously undermined.  It is widely believed in the locality that its closure will have disastrous long term effects on that area.</P>
      <P>I feel obliged to mention the traumatic impact on a disadvantaged inner city community of the closure of a post office.  I refer to the case of the Summerhill post office in my own area, not far from where I live.  In this instance it was not due to An Post policy but to an attack by a heroin addict with a blood filled syringe on the long serving and most respected postmaster.  Government policy was indirectly responsible, in so far as successive Governments have failed to solve the problem of inner city poverty which has led to widespread heroin addiction in that area.  Its closure &mdash; and it remains closed to this day &mdash; has accelerated urban decay in that part of our capital city.  It is a cause of enormous hardship, particularly for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to again compliment Deputy Fox on bringing this issue before the House and I hope that it is successful in the vote tomorrow night.  I wish to restate how disappointed I am with the attitude taken by the Government and its response, which is clearly one of support for the closure of local and rural <Col N="2314" /> post offices.  It is regrettable from a Government with a Labour involvement.  I am surprised that the Minister and Fianna Fáil would support An Post in its destruction of both urban and rural local communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is that An Post is like a vulture waiting for a death &mdash; the death of the ageing postmistress or postmaster in some of the rural local communities.  If any malpractice is detected in a post office this is another wonderful opportunity for them, in that the occupant of the office this is no longer there so it can be closed.  We have had quite a number in Donegal but it is only typical of the entire western seaboard. The sparsely populated areas are those which are suffering most.  A few which come to mind are Ballindrait and Drumkeen in my constituency and, of course, the present hoo-ha which we have had, and properly so, about Carracastle.  There are scores of others and hundreds yet to come.</P>
      <P>Does the Government realise that these centres are, as previous speakers have said, centres around which the local community revolves?  They are far more important than the business which is transacted in them.  They are being subsidised by the efforts of the occupants of the posts of sub-postmaster or postmistress in other directions such as local shop supplies, convenient shopping and so on without which the post office would not be worthwhile.  On the other hand, as it turns out, the local shopping without the post office is not worthwhile either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the net result, whether they die off or as in the case of some who have fallen on such lean times that they have engaged in malpractice in the office and are fired or prosecuted and not replaced, is that every post office which closes will on average cost more in social welfare for the unemployed than the post office is costing the State. That is only in monetary terms.  This <Col N="2315" /> service is vital to the community in cities, towns and elsewhere, not just the rural community.</P>
    <P>Why can we not engage these people by paying them a commission?  It is costing a fortune anyway.  Social welfare costs the taxpayer 100 per cent more than the recipient receives.  Where does it go?  It goes into the collection of taxes, administration, the social welfare officer and so on.  All the wasteful paraphernalia is there and yet much of this could be done in the local community.  This would help retain the post offices, pay the people who run them and provide a service.  There is much talk about rural development and agri-tourism.  All these things are dependent upon an enhanced postal service, not a diminished one, which is what we are facing.</P>
    <P>Where is this wonderful organisation of An Post and where are these wonderful times of development and technological advances in communication?  I recall my first time in this city.  I could post a letter in the GPO as late as 6 p.m. in the evening and it would be received at 9 a.m. the following morning in what would be regarded as a very backward area, that from which I come.  That continued right through the war years and was not just at normal times.  One is lucky now if one gets the letter on the third day and if a weekend intervenes it takes five days.  One cannot rely on it.</P>
    <P>In those days the reliability of An Post was second to none.  Today, regardless of all the advances, it is now totally and absolutely undependable in so far as doing business is concerned.  Remote areas which do not have access to faxes and other types of communication are dependent upon a service that has deteriorated faster than technology has developed in the same period of time.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a town and, as is the case in most towns in the provinces, he is probably regarded as a townie.  He and his father were not elected to this House without the electorate in the hinterland which constitutes a rural area similar to that from which I come.  He is fully aware of the situation <Col N="2316" /> but naturally, as a member of a Government with collective responsibility, it is perhaps difficult for a Minister in those circumstances to really put his mark where he would like to put it.  This would be to not just retain the post office service we have in the more remote areas, suburbs and run-down areas in our cities and towns, but to enhance it.</P>
    <P>We can talk until the cows come home about tourism being the future, but if one does not have a postal service what is one saying to tourists?  They are coming to a place that does not know what day tomorrow is.  They might or might not get the documentation they require urgently at their present hotel address because there will not be any service of the nature that was given in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2317" /> I appeal to the Minister.  He understands the need to enhance our postal service as our population diminishes rather than diminishing the post offices as our people move away.  We want those people back and if we are to build, we want to improve this service which we are getting for buttons.</P>
    <P>Postmistresses and postmasters have not been paid for their work over the years.  The work they do is far beyond that for which they are paid.  They are the local centre and distribute the news, good or bad.  I appeal that these people be nurtured rather than decimated as is the practice of An Post.  In its new role and in the new European scene of competitiveness, An Post seems to forget where it came from and where it is going.</P>
    <P>An Post was never put in place to be a competitor; it was put there as a service.  If they are reaping the benefit in the big centres through their charges and so on, why can they not distribute that over the entire cost?  This was the approach in the past.  I was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at one time.  I remember the telegram I received from a wag back in my constituency on the day I was appointed.  It said: &ldquo;Congratulations.  May you last a long time and long may you P &amp; T.&rdquo;  All I say to the Minister is: long may he P at this stage and never mind the T.  That will be for another day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the policy of An Post to ensure a first class postal service in rural areas is an intrinsic part of wider Government policies which are aimed, in the aggregate, at facilitating and underpinning rural renewal and development.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate gives me to outline the practice of An Post in relation to the closure of rural <Col N="2318" /> and local post offices and to put a few facts on the line.  There is a perception abroad that things are accelerating in a certain direction, which the facts do not support.  Before I deal with that, however, I would like to tell the House something of the general policy that governs the postal service today.</P>
    <P>The Culliton Review of Industrial Policy pointed out that the cost of our postal services is high relative to our competitor countries and urged that An Post's financial difficulties be resolved. Everybody agreed with the Culliton report.  Our postal charges are in the top four in the EU league table.  In the context of its strategy for implementation of the Culliton report, the thrust of which all parties agreed with, the Government decided that An Post should implement efficiency and cost reduction measures without recourse to general price increases or public subsidy.  Also, as part of that strategy the Government has decided that An Post should reduce its postal charges to at least average EU levels over a three year period.</P>
    <P>The current EU average domestic rate for letter mail is 28.3p which compares with this country's rate of 32p for a standard letter.  The gap between Irish and EU domestic rates is therefore about 13 per cent.  On the assumption that exchange rates have a neutral effect, that EU rates increase at 3 per cent per year this year and in 1995 and that Irish rates do not increase at all, An Post will have progressed towards lowering their rates to the EU average as the gap will fall to 5 per cent or 2p on the standard letter by the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch upon some of the developmental measures An Post is taking to strengthen post office services nationally and to underpin rural renewal and development.  We have heard a lot of negative talk here so far this evening.  As part of its plans to improve services to its customers, An Post, in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare and the National Treasury Management Agency, has formulated plans to provide computerised <Col N="2319" /> services linked by a telecommunications network to 1,200 post offices nationwide.  That was earlier regarded as something that should not be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The development of these automated counter service delivery systems will cover the current range of products and services.  It will also provide capability for future products and will enable An Post to tackle the inefficiencies and cost issues associated with manual systems. They will provide for customers a higher quality and more cost effective service and allow for the development of new products within the framework of electronic information transfer, which is, as Deputy Foxe said, a vital component of the future survival of post office networks as we understand them.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of this automation project, which is being funded from An Post's own resources, will see the automation of the 600 busiest offices nationwide. These 600 offices will cater for 84 per cent of the total business transacted. This phase, which commenced with the implementation of central computer systems in 1992, is scheduled for completion by early 1996.  At present equipment is installed at 180 offices nationwide and the system is being rolled out at the rate of 50 offices per quarter.  The target at end 1994 is 335 offices and the remaining 265 will be in place before the end of the first quarter 1996.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the project focuses on the next tranche of 600 post offices.  These offices serve the less densely populated areas and cater for 15 per cent of the remaining customers of An Post. Upgrading these marginalised offices, which are in danger of becoming more disadvantaged when phase 1 of the counter automation is completed, is in keeping with the European Union objectives, particularly that of providing equal quality of service to all inhabitants.  Completing this automation programme over the full 1,200 offices will bring the post office network in Ireland into line with that of our continental counterparts whose programmes and <Col N="2320" /> networks are currently more advanced than ours.  Automation would not be feasible for the remainder given the level of service provided by them, but that does not mean that they do not have a role in the network.  They will continue as before under the same circumstances.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the post office offers the largest and widest network of offices providing financial services in Ireland.  The availability of modern streamlined and cost-effective services, which the automated programme will facilitate, will obviate the need for rural communities to travel significant distances to obtain financial products and services.  That is the purpose of the programme in the first instance.  The post office automation programmes will, in addition, provide an effective bridge between rural communities and the post office networks of other EU member states for the provision of international money transmission products required to cover 99 per cent of business in current post offices.  These services are of critical importance to areas with high levels of emigration.  These areas are encompassed in this automation plan. Plans, therefore, are in place and are being implemented to address what is seen as a serious deficiency in the level of service which can be provided by post offices, given the level of competition from other sources traditionally in the domain of post offices.</P>
    <P>The projected roll out target for phase 2 of the project is as follows: 1994, 120 post offices; 1995, 240 offices; 1996, a further 240 offices.  It is An Post's intention to roll out phase 2 in conjunction with phase 1 and to meet the combined implementation target of 1,200 by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>Another project which will be cofunded by the EU will be the construction of regional mail centres.  An Post has already commenced a major programme of investment in modernising the postal infrastructure.  A new automated mail centre has been built in Dublin costing approximately £15 million and the establishment of a number <Col N="2321" /> of mail centres located in the regions is planned.  The integration of the Dublin and regional mail centres with the national roads distribution network will enable the provision of consistent, highly cost-effective, quality mail services in all rural areas.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed involve the introduction of a mainly road based distribution system linking Dublin with provincial mail depots located at Athlone, Portlaoise, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Bray, Sligo, Tralee and Galway.  Each of these depots will control the movement of mail into and out of the catchment area served by them.  The principal regional mail depots will be fitted with modern material-handling equipment enabling use of European standard containers for the exchange and transfer of rural mails.  The regional mail centres to be constructed at Athlone, Portlaoise and Tipperary will receive co-financed assistance under the Community Support Framework.  When these changes are fully implemented, customers will be able to post until the night mail, generally 5.30 p.m. and secure first delivery next day to any part of the country.  The consolidation of processing at the mail centres will also enable extension of computerised control systems for tracking and tracing all mail products into rural areas.  We must remember that this type of investment was not on the horizon prior to necessary rationalisation which took place to make this semi-State body commercially viable.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of closure of sub-post offices, under section 12 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, An Post is required, among other things, to provide a national postal service to meet the industrial, commercial, social and household needs of the State for comprehensive and efficient postal services, and, so far as the company considers reasonably practicable, to satisfy all reasonable demands for such postal services throughout the State.  Accordingly the provision of postal services in any <Col N="2322" /> particular area is a day to day matter for An Post.</P>
    <P>The company does not require my approval for the closure of individual sub-post offices but the company's judgment must be based on some criteria.  The present policy, with which I agree, is to consider an office for closure when the incumbent postmaster retires or dies, when no family member wants to continue to run the office, where the turnover in the office is too low to yield a long term sustainable living from the job and where there is, within reasonable distance, another post office to which the business can be transferred. As evidence of the working of that policy, I can tell the House that since 1984 a total of 890 offices fell vacant.  Of these 416 or 47 per cent transferred to a family member, 239 or 27 per cent were filled by competition and 235 or 26 per cent were closed under the policy I outlined.  There is nothing new about the closure of sub-post offices under this policy.  In fact closures have been taking place for the past 30 years or so.</P>
    <P>In 1965 the post office network reached its peak.  In that year, counting head post offices, district and branch post offices and sub-post offices, there were 2,270 offices in all, of which 2,175 were sub-post offices.  By the time An Post was established in 1984, the number had fallen to 2,171 of which 2,076 were sub-post offices.  From 1984 to date there were an average of 21 closures a year but in the same period 13 new offices were opened so that today the network stands at 95 company offices and 1,854 sub-post offices, a total of 1,949 offices.  To show the breadth and density of the network, this compares, for example, with a total of approximately 830 outlets currently maintained by the five large banks and 1,030 outlets, if one adds in the network of the country's largest building society. The post office has almost twice that number of outlets.  Ireland has the greatest density of post offices of any EU member state.  Deputy Foxe referred to this.  We have one post office for every 1,800 people, the UK has one for every <Col N="2323" /> 2,500 people, France, Germany and Luxembourg have one per 3,300 population and Portugal, which is not traditionally an industrialised country, has one for every 7,000 people.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the closure of a large number of sub post offices&mdash; over 550 in all &mdash; was put forward in An Post's viability plan in 1991.  The then Minister referred the proposal to consultants for a socio-economic assessment with an associated proposal for the installation of roadside letter boxes. An Post was requested not to proceed with these proposals pending consideration of the consultants' report.  I have had an opportunity of reviewing their report but it has since been very much overtaken by events.</P>
    <P>At the time the consultants were appointed, An Post was in a very precarious financial position.  The company had suffered a loss of £8.7 million for the year ended 31 December 1990 and the outlook for the future, to say the least, was anything but encouraging.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the situation since then has changed considerably culminating in an agreement on necessary recovery measures &mdash; this is often forgotten when we talk about postal services &mdash; to restore the company to financial health being signed by management and the unions with the co-operation of the workforce in September last year.  These measures, many of which are now in place, involved some of the most fundamental changes in the history of postal services and included a transfer from rail to road transport of mails, introduction of single daily delivery of mail in Dublin and other urban areas and the commencement of operations in the new Dublin Mails Centre, which replaced the outdated Central Sorting Office in Sheriff Street.</P>
    <P>The agreement on recovery measures also provides for a revision of rural network routes which will result in economies being achieved in rural deliveries. The proposals are currently the subject of discussions with the unions and will <Col N="2324" /> not affect the counter services provided in rural post offices.  In some quarters the revision of these rural network routes is associated with closure of sub post offices; this view is incorrect.  The revision consists of the development of new delivery routes based on mileage, number of delivery points, frequency of delivery, type of road, etc., to ensure the optimum use of the staff and vehicles involved.  Under the project the number of sub post offices which do their own sorting will be reduced but there will be no lessening in the number of sub post offices operating or in the level of counter service available to the public.  That is the important point.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to pay tribute to the effort put in by management and unions in An Post in securing agreement on these necessary recovery measures.  I am well aware that sacrifices were called for from both sides.  However, while the position of An Post has improved there is a continuing need for the company to address the cost issues, improve services to its customers and increase revenues, which must also be a vital part of any recovery plan.  This can only be achieved through the continued commitment of both management and staff and that is there.</P>
    <P>Last year An Post turned in a profit of £4.8 million after tax and with three quarters of the year gone the indications are for a similar profit in the current year.  These results, of course, are no guarantee of the future financial health of the company, but it is a major turnaround compared to the context in which this debate was held in 1991.  While An Post continues to have difficulties with its high costs, its revenues too are under threat, both from EU liberalisation proposals and from technological changes in the market place.</P>
    <P>In this regard the European Commission in June 1992, for the information of the House, published a Green Paper on the development of the Single Market for postal services.  The central thrust of the Green Paper is the provision of a universal postal service at affordable prices and with a satisfactory <Col N="2325" /> quality of service throughout the European Community.  Beyond the central thrust the Green Paper envisages a number of changes in the Community postal sector, including the introduction of additional competition by the liberalisation of certain areas of the letter mail services such as international mail, direct mail, advertising material, and new types of services.</P>
    <P>I support the central thrust of the Green Paper towards a Single Market. I have indicated that if detailed analysis shows that the introduction of a particular liberalisation measure would be in the interests of the customer and would not jeopardise the capacity of An Post to provide a universal service of the required quality, in such cases serious consideration will have to be given to its introduction.  The interests of the customer and the financial health of An Post can go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>In addition to the competition that An Post will face from couriers and European competitors, we all recognise that changes in technology, for example electronic mail and facsimile transmissions, will continue to cut into the company's markets.  It is not a static market.  The company is gearing up to meet these challenges and with the continuing co-operation from staff and support from its customers, which is vital, it is well placed to absorb these challenges.  The policy being pursued by An Post is part of an integrated approach to provide high quality and affordable services and infrastructure to rural communities.</P>
    <P>To broaden the argument for a moment, for the development of any region of the economy, urban or rural, it is vital that sound macroeconomic policies are pursued.  The Government is pursuing such policies, they contribute to low inflation and low interest rates, which are essential to economic progress and employment growth throughout the economy.  This economic progress is manifesting itself in strong output growth this year of the order of 5.5 per cent accompanied by an expected growth in non-agricultural <Col N="2326" /> employment of 28,000.  We are witnessing a welcome fall in unemployment, with numbers on the live register down by 20,600 since the beginning of the year.  The benefits of strong economic and employment growth spread throughout the economy and sustaining such growth is the surest way of providing real and tangible benefits to rural areas, areas I represent the same as other Deputies who have spoken and will be speaking in this debate.</P>
    <P>However, Government policy towards rural areas does not rely on the organic spread of economic growth alone.  Initiatives are also being taken through the Structural Funds and other policy measures.  The investment programmes under the Structural Funds are transforming the physical and economic infrastructure of the whole economy.  Our road networks, water and sewage treatment facilities throughout the country are being constantly improved.  High quality telecommunications, another area under my aegis, are a vital part of the modern business world and are being provided for throughout the country.  We have to meet that challenge also as more of the same will not do.  Tourism, a major source of income and employment in rural areas, has benefited from substantial Structural Funds investment and will continue to do so.  The extension of urban renewal incentives to more towns throughout the country will also benefit the surrounding rural areas.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are acting as catalysts for business and enterprise development in each county. The community employment programme is tackling unemployment on a nationwide basis through providing employment of economic and social value as well as training for the unemployed with the ultimate aim of reintegrating them back into the workforce. Various training and education programmes aimed at improving the skills of the population will, of course, also enhance the skill of rural people and enhance their income and employment prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> There are also many direct initiatives in rural development.  The Leader programme and measures promoting alternative rural based enterprises create an enterprise culture which is helping to reinvigorate rural areas and reduce their dependence on traditional agricultural enterprises.  Industrial development and the spread of manufacturing and service employment to the larger towns throughout the country is a major benefit to the surrounding rural areas. The Government programme of decentralisation, pioneered by this party in a minority Government and continued through successive Governments of which we have been a member, has involved the relocation of 3,500 civil servants to 19 provincial locations and is also benefiting rural areas through its effects on the demand for services.  It has also permitted many people to return closer to their rural roots thus invigorating the rural areas in question.</P>
    <P>The question of social change is a reality in every country in Europe.  It requires responses first at a macroeconomic level where there is economic growth, but we do not simply depend on the overspill of that growth to rural communities.  We have direct interventionist policies at microeconomic level which are beginning to work.  We have seen an improvement in that area by empowering local communities, through Leader programmes, county enterprise boards and the many other initiatives where we are seeking locally based, locally focused initiatives to deal with problems which will not be solved in the short term and which will remain with us.  The Government and politicians are conscious of the need to bring forward imaginative and innovative responses to make sure that the maintenance of rural communities has a high priority as part of national policy. It is in the interest of the quality of life if nothing else that those rural communities be maintained.</P>
    <P>Apart from the specific issues which I have addressed, the wider issues illustrate that we are seeking to underpin <Col N="2328" /> rural renewal and development.  The Government has done much in the past 22 months with the assistance of EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds to establish locally based initiatives which are now beginning to work.  Anybody who has considered the Leader programmes and what has emerged from the Leader groups throughout the country can only be impressed and encouraged by the fact that not simply in west County Clare where the pioneering work of Father Bohan has been mentioned but throughout rural Ireland people are falling back on their own resources.  Only this week I was able to assist a County Offaly tourism group, who through a direct marketing initiative under the Leader programmes, are in the USA talking to the travel trade and travel writers and obtaining some niche heritage tourism into an area where such would not otherwise take place, despite the best efforts of the broader policies of Bord Fáilte and other such organisations.</P>
    <P>Such initiatives would not take place if people were not out selling their own communities, and prepared to be optimistic about the benefits which would accrue to their area as a result of such initiatives.  What local community in the midlands, the west or anywhere else would have been able, and would have had the wherewithal, to engage in such initiatives ten, let alone 20 or 30 years ago, without access to these kinds of funds?  This illustrates the change in this area.  Many of us, as local and public representatives, are leading the fight for local communities to see in what way they can exploit their own local resources for the benefit of their areas.</P>
    <P>Through investment in the modernisation of our postal services, we are making it possible to ensure their viability, to implement the recovery measures which have been agreed between management and unions and not to remain with the <i>status quo.</i> Everybody could see that the demise of the service was inevitable if a change was not brought about to deal with new products, and to compete with couriers, facsimile <Col N="2329" /> machines, telephones and such like which are taking over the functions of the postal services.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently announced that he has asked the Minister for Finance to undertake a study which would involve an examination of the demographic changes in rural areas.  The study will include an examination of the effect of population changes on various State policies, including those which I have mentioned.  When the study is completed it will be for the Government to decide what lessons we can all learn and whether modification of existing policies is warranted.  There is a recognition and an understanding of the type of social change that is happening, and inevitable in some senses.  There is a need for imaginative policy responses from the Government, and we are in the process of providing these, not simply with regard to the urban and rural post offices in terms of the level of service they can provide, which is under my aegis, but throughout the gamut of Government policy to ensure that we meet the needs of rural communities in the same way as we seek to meet the needs of urban dwellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Fox and the Technical Group for bringing this timely and opportune motion before the House.  It is vital that it be brought before the forum in which legislation is drafted and decisions are made, including ultimate choices as to our priorities.  It is vital at present, when the sacred god of rationalisation is being foisted on all areas of economic development that we look rationally at what is a social and economic service and decide exactly where our priorities lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was as a result of a similar motion before the House two years ago that the infamous viability plan was finally put on the shelf, once and for all, it was believed.  I pay tribute to the Communications Workers Union who, on that occassion, took the campaign to the local communities, both rural and urban, and <Col N="2330" /> eventually succeeded in a commonsense approach.  Logic won the day.</P>
    <P>Had that viability plan been implemented in its original form, it would have devastated rural and small urban communities.  The main tenets of the plan are worth recalling and included the closure of 550 rural sub post offices within a short period of time and, with regard to the post office structure itself, the relegation of offices in large towns to sub post office status.  In addition, the loss of 1,500 jobs was proposed, the erection of letter boxes at the heads of rural laneways and a number of other elements which, collectively, would have destroyed rural communities.</P>
    <P>The economic basis of the viability plan was never fully disclosed because Minister advises that he has considered the report from the consultants, yet we still have not been advised of the key arguments which were supposed to have underpinned the plan.</P>
    <P>There is a strong social argument with regard to the postal services, but there is also the economic argument.  Many fallacious arguments are being advanced regarding the non viability of certain post offices.  When the breakdown of the sub post office structure is considered, and when an examination is made of what they cost An Post in net terms, it is evident that they are providing services free <i>gratis</i> to the community and to An Post.  When it is considered that 180 sub post offices cost An Post £3,000 per annum, or less than £60 per week, it is obvious that the cost of lighting, heating, public liability insurance, staffing levels, or whatever else may be necessary to the provision of the service, is being provided at a loss by the sub postmaster or sub postmistress giving the service.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the fact that the sub post office itself is being augmented, supplemented, supported and propped up by a local shop, or whatever, it could not provide a service and remain in operation.  If An Post itself was providing this service, it would have gone to <Col N="2331" /> the wall years ago.  Going up the graduated scale of payments to sub post offices, this case is substantiated throughout.</P>
    <P>When An Post was removed from under the umbrella of the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs, there was a general expectation that it would show flair, entrepreneurial skill and enterprise, that it would bite the economic bullet, would realise the economic opportunities available and would become a viable competitor in the financial services sector.  However, what has been produced in terms of enterprise and flair has been nothing other than a series of mickey mouse schemes which have been utter failures. For example, there was the scheme whereby a person made a tape at home and sent it to Aunt Mary in America which she then rubbed out and returned.  If that is the best that could be done in this day and age it would be best to forget it.  There was also the scheme where the interest of children in letter writing and communications was developed &mdash; post cards were sent to somebody in some other part of the world, or, indeed, down the road, who painted the back of the card and returned it.  There were numerous other failed schemes devised as a way of illustrating the supposed flair and enterprise of those at management level in An Post.  They were all costly failures. Despite this, the core service was neglected.  For example, in the days of the threepenny stamp, if a letter was posted in Dublin, it could be guaranteed that it would be delivered in Belmullet the following day.  That guarantee is now gone.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether there is a conscious effort to upgrade the level of efficiency in that regard, the net result is that one simply cannot rely on the service to deliver the letter.  A number of years ago, as Deputy Blaney said, there was the much cherished telegram which we all hoped would one day arrive at our doorstep to inform us that we had won £50,000 in the Irish Hospitals <Col N="2332" /> Sweepstakes.  We no longer have the telegram; we now have the telemessage at approximately five times the cost which is delivered, not in some parts of the country on the day it is dispatched, but the following day and which has exactly the same status as a letter.  There are numerous other examples of where the core services provided by An Post are considerably less efficient than they were in days of much less automation and mechanisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach anseo trathnóna agus éisteacht leis an méid atá á rá agam.</P>
      <P>The Lakeshore group water scheme in Oughterard was initiated in 1990.  It has 101 members, of whom 89 are householders and 31 are farmers.  The area involved is outside Oughterard along the Glann Road by the lake shore.  In this area most people are either dependent on private wells or are using water directly from Lough Corrib. However, in an area which is one of our premier tourist areas, neither of these solutions is satisfactory as many of the wells dry up in the summer and there are difficulties regarding the quality of the lake water.</P>
      <P>I can testify to the unsatisfactory nature of a well for a regular water supply. It is a particular problem for anyone involved in the tourism industry.  Lack of water supply is probably the worst problem faced by people in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oughterard town supply was upgraded in the 1980s.  The plan is to tap off that main supply and provide a piped system along the Glann Road and into Baurnagorteeney.  The system has been approved, by Galway County Council and I understand the design has <Col N="2333" /> been approved by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>As in other group water schemes, the unit cost of this scheme is rather high. It is fair to say this is a feature of the areas not yet provided with running water through mains pipes.  Working in Connemara in difficult ground where rock is never far from the surface, adds to the cost.  I accept this is a perennial problem with schemes in the Connemara area.  However, development of tourism in this area and the right of the people to have a reasonable standard of services warrants the provision of piped water.</P>
    <P>The specification for the main pipe was increased by the county council because of a proposal in this scheme to connect the Oughterard town supply to an existing group water scheme in Glann.  This latter scheme serves 35 households and 22 farms.  I understand Telecom Éireann is about to embark on laying pipes in the area and has indicated its interest in sharing costs by laying cables along the trench dug for the water scheme.  In such a scenic rural area, the provision of underground cable would be highly commended.</P>
    <P>I have rarely heard complaints from people living in rural areas about the cost of providing water.  People living in urban areas often complain about having to pay £45 per year but they never have to pay for head work costs or basic installation costs.  The people in this area are willing to pay £600 per head for this scheme.  They realise that in ten years time they will have to pay 80 per cent of the council rates in addition to the maintenance of their own scheme. In our case that would amount to £80 per year for the provision of water from the head works and they would then be required to maintain their own scheme.</P>
    <P>Rural people are good at self help and I ask the Minister to favourably consider sanctioning the scheme notwithstanding the high cost per house.  I would point out to him also that people in 41 houses on the route of this scheme, which is four and a half miles long, will probably join the scheme if it is put in <Col N="2334" /> place but they have not yet given a commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposed group water scheme has a design capacity to serve up to 107 households and farms in an area alongside the shores of Lough Corrib, north of Oughterard.  The Oughterard public water supply scheme will provide a source of treated water for this group water scheme.  At the request of Galway County Council, the group scheme design has been revised to take account of the council's long term water supply plans for the Oughterard region. This includes the provision of large diameter watermains which will be needed to serve projected downstream demand.</P>
      <P>The requirement to lay larger distribution mains will add significantly to the overall cost of the scheme.  Deputy Ó Cuív is only too well aware that the rocky Connemara terrain does not easily yield to shovel or spade with the result that excavation costs are substantially higher than for schemes in general.  The end result is that the estimated cost of completing this 107 house scheme is about £350,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the most up to date information from the group, group water scheme grants would amount to less than £100,000 or less than 30 per cent of the overall cost.  As a result, the scheme is not economically viable on the basis of standard group water scheme grants of £700 per house and £500 per farm and would require an additional supplementary grant of over £160,000 to meet the high cost of larger water mains and excavation in rock. The additional moneys needed to finance this scheme would have to be found from within my Department's provision for public water and sewerage schemes.  The high level of existing commitments, and the demands of schemes already given priority for investment, account for all finance available to the water services programme at present.  It is not possible therefore, to provide <Col N="2335" /> funding for the Lakeshore scheme at this stage.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the position will be further reviewed in light of the EU Commission's recent approval of my Department's operational programme for environmental services, 1994-99, which includes a measure aimed at targeting European Regional Development Fund support towards certain large scale group schemes which provide a basis for the economic development of their areas.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the strong case made by the Deputy.  As he knows, in the last year or so I tried to concentrate considerable resources in the remaining group water schemes which, as he said, are more costly than previous ones.  As a result of some success in Europe we will be able to take on board schemes which were extremely difficult up to now on a cost per house basis.  I appreciate that people contributing towards and involved in group water schemes pay considerably more for these services than their counterparts in other parts of the country.  I have tried to take that into account and I assure the Deputy that while I cannot approve the scheme now I look forward to being in a position to do so in 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the need to provide substantial funding to local authorities in Border counties to restore cross-Border roads.  This is a very important issue in Ulster and adjoining areas.  I am glad that the opportunity has arisen for these important links to be restored and I urge the Government to convey on a daily basis to the British authorities the urgent need to have closed Border roads reopened.  There must not be further foot dragging by the British Government on this issue.  Over the years, public representatives in Border counties have sought the reopening of <Col N="2336" /> important links between North and South but, basically, our legitimate concerns and views were not heeded by the British who shielded their negative response behind &ldquo;security considerations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put on record my appreciation of the Taoiseach's work in advancing the peace process.  His Government colleagues, Mr. John Hume and others must also be complimented.  It is important that the cessation of violence by both sides in the Six Counties is met by positive and visible improvements in the life of local communities.  Surely an early and visible peace dividend would be the restoration of transport and road links between counties, North and South.</P>
      <P>Border road closures have caused immeasurable hardship to communities, North and South, and led in some instances to the destruction of normal commercial and social life.  Normal living can only be restored when Border links are restored.  Both the Irish and British Governments urgently need to implement measures to redress the situation that has arisen after 25 years of trouble in Ulster.  People should be able to see the benefits that accrue from a lasting peace.  The troubles in the North have hindered the development of commerce and trade in Border areas.  Towns were cut off from their natural hinterlands by the closure of cross-Border roads and nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the case of the N3, the national primary road from Dublin through Cavan, Enniskillen and on to Donegal which abruptly ends on the Cavan-Fermanagh border at Aghalane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions in the House and in meetings with the Minister for the Environment I raised the problems in County Cavan because of the totally inadequate road network. The deficient road system in that county has been exacerbated by Border road closures with a consequent transfer of pressure to other roads.  I compliment the Minister for the Environment who spoke of the importance of the proper restoration of Border links when on a <Col N="2337" /> recent visit to Fermanagh.  He quite rightly outlined the need for such a development from a social point of view, such as the facilitation of contact between local communities and the generation of new business activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that finance will be made available to local authorities to carry out the necessary works to roads as soon as a decision to reopen has been taken.  The Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, announced that the necessary funds will be made available to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment which will enable them to bring Border crossings up to an acceptable standard.  Our local authorities must be allocated the necessary funding to restore road links which have lain derelict for years.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the Department of the Environment and local councils tackling this task in a businesslike and efficient manner.  The end product must be a modern and up to standard road link.  It would be appropriate and necessary to harmonise road standards on both sides of the Border and I trust the financial allocations will enable this to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Cavan and Monaghan have suffered severely from Border road closures and I can think of seven important road links between Cavan and Fermanagh that should be reopened.  I mentioned the N3 which has adversely affected the economic and social life of Belturbet town and its catchment area since the early 1970s.  The other roads, namely, Uragh, Drumbrughas, Cornagran, Drumconra and Drummersee, which are in the vicinity of Swanlinbar and Clonandra near Redhills need to be reopened at the earliest possible date. The towns of Belturbet and Swanlinbar have suffered from these closures and are entitled to the restoration of all links between their local communities and, as is the case with Swanlinbar, the restoration of roads North and South within its own parish of Kinawley.  I know that Cavan County Council has put forward realistic proposals to the Minister for <Col N="2338" /> funding to enable the necessary works to be carried out on these roads.</P>
    <P>Each report on the Border areas highlighted the deficient transport infrastructure.  The welcome advance in the peace process gives the Government an opportunity to redress those deficiencies.  I look forward to the Minister giving local authorities, such as Cavan County Council, the necessary level of funding to restore to the appropriate standards such vital and important road links that will benefit the lifestyle of people, North and South, improve local economies and opportunities for employment creation.</P>

We are all aware of the momentous changes north of the Border and of the tremendous opportunities which they afford us to forge a lasting peace.  One of the main challenges facing us in this context is to build on the momentum for peace and to contribute in every way we can to building trust, co-operation and joint action as a way of both consolidating and building on the achievements to date.  It would be difficult to overstimate the importance of this process in terms of the future of all the people on this island.</P>
      <P>One of the most visible dimensions to the Northern conflict is, of course, the closure of cross-Border roads.  It is difficult to think of any other manifestation of the Northern conflict which conveys the nature and extent of the problem in quite such a tangible and, for many years, permanent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, let no one forget that roads play a vital role in the social and economic life of the Border areas. The traditional problems encountered by these areas in promoting economic development because of distances from the main centres of economic activity both within Ireland, North and South, and the broader European context have been exacerbated for too long by conflict in Northern Ireland.  The situation there has also served to inhibit trade <Col N="2339" /> links between both parts of Ireland with implications for employment and living conditions generally.  The 1989-93 INTERREG programme for roads in Border areas made a valuable contribution towards addressing the disadvantages experienced by such areas.</P>
    <P>The cessation of violence provides an opportunity to strengthen North-South social and economic ties for the benefit of the people and the economies in both parts of the island, particularly in Border areas.  I welcome these developments.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced on 16 and 22 September 1994 that closure orders in respect of a total of 16 Border crossing points have been rescinded, taking account of the advice of the British Army on the implications for security.  The roads concerned are concentrated on the Monaghan-Fermanagh and Donegal-Derry borders.  In general, they are minor roads catering for localised rather than significant levels of cross-Border traffic.</P>
    <P>In response to this initiative, I allocated grants totalling £77,500 to Monaghan and Cavan County Councils in respect of road reconstruction work required to bring disused sections of the roads concerned in the initial announcement into service.  The councils have been requested to carry out repairs immediately and have, I understand, already completed work on some of the roads concerned.  I expect to be in a position shortly to announce further grants in respect of the balance of the roads designated for reopening.</P>
    <P>The likely timescale for a possible general reopening of roads is unclear at this stage.  The latest information supplied by county councils indicates that a total of approximately 110 public roads have been closed for security reasons and a substantial number of private roads were similarly affected.  The cost implications of reopening all public roads are being reviewed in consultation with the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2340" /> In response to the recent announcement by the Northern Ireland authorities that a review of all road closures is underway, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has emphasised to the Secretary of State the importance of ensuring that the review is completed as quickly as possible and that it leads to a programme of reopening roads in all of the affected areas.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, I have already provided funding for the reopening of Border roads and I am committed to making available further resources so that roads may again fulfil their vital role as avenues of communication and contribute to an environment in which both communities can grow in trust, in harmony and economically.</P>
    <P>I am also determined to maximise the potential benefits for Border areas through the operation of INTERREG II, 1994-99, which offers a mechanism for European Union support in tackling infrastructural deficiencies, including those in the roads area.  Respective programmes north and south of the Border will be subject to joint consultation and periodic reviews.  I am sure that the House will agree that everything possible is being done to accord the necessary priority to this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Smith, who has tirelessly and almost continually harassed the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and me about the need for funding for the roads in Cavan and Monaghan, that we are responding to this matter as positively as we can.  In the context of the Border and the need to open up new opportunities following on from the peace process, we recognise that the communities in those areas rely almost exclusively on the road network and do not have an alternative public transport system.  In the light of developments in the North, every effort will be made to ensure that funds are made available so that the work can get underway and be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork has a major housing crisis, with 2,500 applicants on the housing list and an average waiting period of three years by an applicant for a house. The 1988 tenant purchase scheme offered the tenants of Cork Corporation and other local authorities the hope of purchasing and owning their flats.  Some of these tenants have spent more than 30 years in their family homes and, in anticipation of eventually being able to purchase them, in recent years they modernised and upgraded them through the installation of aluminium windows and doors and central heating.</P>
      <P>A problem arose in regard to the weekly maintenance fees of £5 per week announced by Cork Corporation which would have to be paid on top of the purchase price by the tenants.  Everyone in Cork thought this matter had been resolved when an agreement was reached by the tenants and Cork Corporation that a £3 per week maintenance fee would be paid.  In response to numerous questions from me and other Deputies in the south, the Minister said that a comprehensive legal agreement was being drafted by the Department which would allow local authorities enter into a sale contract.  The announcement by the Minister by way of letter to Cork Corporation that the offers to these tenants were being withdrawn came as a bolt out of the blue and shattered the dreams and ambitions of many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To add to that shock, the insulting comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, last Sunday that compensatory mechanisms would be in place were unbelievable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg must be aware of the housing crisis in Cork.  He offered the tenants, many of whom have been living in their homes for more than 30 years, the opportunity to move out of their family homes and to be given top priority status on the Cork Corporation waiting list for a house which he said they could subsequently buy.  To say the least, this is totally unacceptable to the <Col N="2342" /> majority of tenants who wish to stay in their family homes and purchase them.</P>
    <P>A major public protest meeting is being held in Cork tonight.  This meeting has been organised by the tenants who are affected and who are incensed at the insensitive handling of this affair by both Ministers.  The serious situation brought about by last week's announcement should not have been made worse by the false promises made by the Minister last Sunday to dig himself out of a political hole.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a commitment to meet delegations from Cork Corporation and representatives of the tenants affected.  The hopes and aspirations of hundreds of families in Cork city and other areas to become home owners have been sunk by the political ineptitude displayed during the past days, weeks and years.  Many of these families are neighbours of mine and during the weekend I saw how shocked and disillusioned they are at the announcement made by the Minister's office last week by way of circular letter to Cork Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy that as many local authority tenants as possible should have the option of purchasing their dwellings and tenant purchase schemes for some time envisaged that, in principle, both local authority houses and flats could be purchased by tenants.  However, as explained to the House in a comprehensive reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 228 and 235 last Tuesday, important issues have now arisen in the implementation of selling local authority flats.  In response to concerns expressed by some authorities, a detailed examination of all the aspects involved in the sale of their flats was carried out by my Department in consultation with the authorities principally concerned and with the assistance of independent legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main reasons flats would be a bad buy for tenants: first, the level of service charges that would be necessary, second, public liability <Col N="2343" /> insurance and third, the future saleability of purchased flats.</P>
    <P>First, the management company which would have to be set up to look after the management and maintenance of the flat block would have to have its operations financed from a service charge levied on the purchasers and the local authority for those flats which have not been purchased.  In addition to paying the cost of insurance, routine maintenance and day-to-day management, the service charge would also have to include a contribution to a reserve fund which would have to be set up to meet the cost of major structural works that would arise over time if the flats were not to deteriorate and depreciate in value.  It is clear that the amount of any such service charge would be unaffordable to the vast majority of tenants and, together with the mortgage repayments, would result in considerably greater outgoings than current average rent levels, which are in the region of £10 per week.</P>
    <P>Second, the management company would have to obtain insurance against public liability risks and, because of the high level of public liability claims relating to local authority flat complexes, it is clear that there would be considerable difficulty in obtaining such insurance at any kind of realistic price or, indeed, at all.</P>
    <P>Third, it would not be desirable to sell flats to tenants if they did not have a reasonable prospect of being able to sell-on the flat in the future should they need or wish to do so for any reason. A second hand flat which did not have access to an adequate reserve fund and proper insurance cover would not be saleable and would not be regarded as suitable security for a loan by a mortgage lender.</P>
    <P>Against this background any decision to proceed with the sale of local authority flats would ultimately prove to be a disservice to tenant purchasers.  Notwithstanding any new legislative provisions that I might introduce, no practicable arrangements could be made for <Col N="2344" /> such sales that would prove to be satisfactory to tenant purchasers or to tenants who did not wish to buy.</P>
    <P>It is essential to guard against a situation in the future where tenant purchasers, or their successors, would end up with a property which they no longer need or on which they were paying unaffordable service charges but which they would have no prospect of selling at a realistic price.</P>
    <P>The difficulties outlined above may not apply in the case of all local authority maisonettes.  Authorities have been asked to consider whether satisfactory arrangements can be made for the sale of maisonettes to tenants who express an interest in purchasing.  I have impressed on the local authorities involved the need to draw the attention of these tenants to the various measures available to assist them in purchasing alternative dwellings and to facilitate to the greatest possible extent the tenants who apply to purchase.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to accede to Deputy Allen's request to meet public representatives and representatives of the tenants.  When the Housing Bill was being debated a few years ago, there was an earlier understanding from local authorities that the sale of flats could take place.  As we were discussing that Bill, information came through that there were insurmountable difficulties.  I made changes in the legislation &mdash; I was supported by all sides of the House in doing so &mdash; to facilitate those sales and I would have been happy to see them proceed.  We have encountered very difficult problems in relation to this whole matter.  While the difficulties appear insurmountable in many ways, I am happy to make my offices available to see whether there is any way we can sort out this problem for certain types of flat complexes with communal facilities where a great many people obviously could not afford to pay the service charges.  I wish to be as flexible as possible because the attachment to ownership in Ireland is very deep.  If these people wish to own their flat complexes <Col N="2345" /> I want to facilitate them but I cannot foresee a comprehensive answer where everyone could be accommodated.  It may well be that we can sort out some of the problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the last exchange I should inform the Minister that I have written to his Minister of State proposing an alternative to make flats the subject of a signable leasehold so that people could at least keep them in the family while paying the rent for them.  I attended a public meeting in my own constituency where everybody thought that was a just approach because they appreciated some of the problems the Minister has raised.</P>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is the issue of the computation of pensions of retiring members of the Defence Forces.  I have been written to by a number of retired personnel who have indicated that there is unfair discrimination between those who retired before and after August 1990.  If you retired prior to that date your military service allowance is not reckoned as part of your income for the purpose of determining your pension, whereas if you retire after that date it is.</P>
      <P>As I understand it the Gleeson Commission, which examined the question of remuneration in the Defence Forces, said that in their view such military service allowance should be reckonable in respect of pension entitlements and should be implemented immediately with retrospective effect, regardless of whether the person retired before or after August 1990.  I understand &mdash; and I do not criticise them &mdash; the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Association negotiated hard with the Department of Defence for the implementation of the Gleeson report but settled for the 1990 cut off point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to inform the House of the number of people affected <Col N="2346" /> by the 1990 cut off point and the cost to the Exchequer of implementing the Gleeson recommendation in full so that we know the financial implications of taking military service allowance into the reckoning for deciding the pension entitlements of those who retired prior to August 1990.  Based on the letters I have received, there is a manifest feeling of injustice that people who retired from the same job on different dates are paid pension on a wholly different basis. Those who retired prior to August 1990 are not entitled to have their military service allowance taken into account in computing their pensions.  Those people who are receiving less than those who retired months later, although they effectively completed the same service, have a genuine grievance.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking at the justice of the case would appreciate it is not contrived.  It is not like the labourers in the vineyard.  Everybody worked for the State as a member of the Defence Forces on equal terms and everyone received the military service allowance but some people are being told it does not count for the purpose of computing their pensions.  It is very difficult for a person who retired over four years ago to see a colleague, who survived him in military service by a matter of months receive a larger pension on the basis of an arbitrary cut off point which would not have been set if the Gleeson Commission's report had been implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces pensions code is unique in the public sector in that provision is made for the payment of immediate pensions and gratuities after unusually short periods of service and regardless of age.  The minimum service required for a pension and gratuity is 12 years in the case of commissioned officers and 21 years in the case of enlisted personnel. Maximum pension can be attained after as little as 24 or 25 years' service by officers and 31 years by enlisted personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Military service allowance was introduced in 1979 as compensation for the <Col N="2347" /> special disadvantages associated with military life and was not reckonable for pension or gratuity purposes.  The inclusion of this allowance in reckonable earnings was subsequently considered by an interdepartmental committee which proposed that consideration should be given to the question of making the allowance pensionable.</P>
    <P>In its report, dated 31 July 1990, the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, recommended that the military service allowance should be made pensionable. On foot of this recommendation, an addition to Defence Forces pensions in respect of military service allowance was introduced and applies, subject to certain conditions, to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, i.e. the day following publication of the commission's report.  Military service allowance has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified retired personnel.</P>
    <P>The pension payable to an NCO or private on retirement consists of a basic flat rate, which varies according to rank, in respect of 21 years' service; an addition to basic pension of £14.45 a week in respect of military service allowance, 40 per cent of the rate of that allowance; where pensionable service is 31 or more years, an increased addition in respect of military service allowance <Col N="2348" /> of £18.06 a week, 50 per cent of the rate of that allowance; and an additional increment of £3.51 a week in respect of each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.  An additional amount in respect of certain allowances may also be payable.</P>
    <P>The question of the inclusion of military service allowance in the pension of personnel who retired from the Defence Forces prior to August 1990 has been raised on a number of occasions in the House in recent times.  The line consistently taken has been that having regard to established superannuation practice in other areas of the public service, and the cost involved, the extension of the measure to pensioners who retired prior to 1 August 1990 cannot be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson Commission in its report concluded that the overall value of the superannuation benefits provided for the Defence Forces is considerably in excess of those available under other public service schemes.  Deputy McDowell asked the number of people affected by the 1990 cut off point and the cost to the Exchequer of making retrospective payment to those who retired prior to August 1990.  I will ask the Minister for Defence to communicate directly with the Deputy on those details.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October 1994.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea.</P>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the reported development of a nuclear weapons programme by North Korea and at North Korea's failure to comply with its obligations arising from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This concern has been expressed on several occasions, nationally and as a member of the EU.  We regard North Korea's non-compliance with international obligations which it has freely assumed as a very serious challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards regime.</P>
      <P>We therefore avail of all opportunities to press North Korea to comply fully with all relevant legal obligations, to co-operate immediately with the IAEA in implementation of its safeguards agreement with the agency and specifically to allow the agency to have access to all information relevant to safeguards and to locations.  As a member of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, Ireland has co-sponsored a number of Resolutions on this issue, including the Resolution of 10 June 1994 which suspended agency assistance to North Korea.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the news today that agreement has been reached in Geneva in bilateral talks between the US and North Korea on an ad-referendum framework document.  While details of the agreement are not available, I hope that it will contribute to stability on the Korean Peninsula.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47, 63, 68, 69, 100, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Government at the human rights situation in East Timor and at the actions of the Indonesian authorities there are well known and have been expressed in this House on many occasions in the recent past. Since I last spoke on the matter the Government has continued to take an active interest in the plight of the East Timorese people and has highlighted its concern at recent bilateral and international meetings:</P>
      <P>&mdash;in my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 29 September I pointed to human rights abuses in East Timor as an issue requiring international action;</P>
      <P>&mdash;at the recent Conference of European Union and ASEAN Ministers in Karlsruhe, Germany, Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, raised the concerns of the Irish Government and people directly with the Indonesian Foreign Minister Mr. Ali Alatas;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" />&mdash;and during his visit to Australia last month the Taoiseach discussed the issue with Prime Minister Keating.</P>
    <P>In addition, with Ireland's strong support, the issue of East Timor was covered in the memorandum submitted by the European Union to the United Nations for the 49th session of the General Assembly, and was raised by the German Presidency of the EU at the EU/ASEAN Conference in Karlsruhe.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to raise this issue at every appropriate opportunity.  At the meeting of the Indonesian and Portuguese Foreign Ministers which took place in May of this year under the auspices of the UN Secretary General, it was agreed that access to East Timor for the United Nations and human rights organisations should be continued and expanded.</P>
    <P>I strongly supported the statement issued by the EU in July, which reaffirmed once again the need for observance of human rights in East Timor and for free access to the territory for international organisations.  Ireland will continue to press for full and free access to East Timor for human rights organisations, including Amnesty International.</P>
    <P>I continue to support the dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United Nations as the best means of achieving respect for human rights and a lasting solution to the question of East Timor.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 83, 91 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that emergency relief and <Col N="2109" /> rehabilitation work in the Ogoni region of Nigeria funded by the EU, by NGOs and by bilateral donors, including Ireland, has been severely hampered by the activity of the security forces in the region.  This is especially regrettable given the urgent requirement for emergency relief and rehabilitation work in the Ogoni region at present.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Presidency, on behalf of the EU embassies in Lagos, has called on the Nigerian Government to allow proper medical and relief supplies to be brought to the afflicted populations and to facilitate liaison with local and international aid and relief organisations to this end.  The Presidency has also conveyed to the Nigerian authorities its serious concern about reports of attacks on civilians and their property by members of the armed forces.</P>
    <P>The response of the Nigerian authorities is that they deny the allegations. In that context, I support a proposal which has been made among EU representatives in Lagos that a fact-finding mission consisting of a representative of the EU and representatives of human rights and aid organizations should be sent to the area to examine the situation on the ground.</P>
    <P>Recent contacts by our Embassy in Lagos with the Irish aid co-ordinator in the area suggested that the situation has improved somewhat in the past week, and that it may now be possible to proceed from an emergency food and medicine programme to rehabilitation work in the local villages.  The Embassy in Lagos will continue to monitor the situation closely in co-ordination with our EU Partners, aid agencies and aid workers in the Ogoni region, with a view to deciding what further action we can take to ensure implementation of the relief programme.</P>

      <P>I visited the United States from 25 September to 1 October.  On 26-28 September, I attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York and addressed the Assembly on 28 September.  While in New York, I also availed of the opportunity to meet a range of media representatives as well as Irish community leaders.</P>
      <P>In the course of my visit to Washington from 29 September&mdash;1 October, I met President Clinton; Vice-President Gore; Secretary of State Christopher; National Security Adviser Lake; and other senior Administration officials.  I also met Speaker Foley; Senate Majority Leader Mitchell, Senators Dole, Kennedy, Leahy, Simpson; Representatives Michel and Obey and other leading member of the Congress.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I had previously met President Clinton on Martha's Vineyard on 2 September.  The Taoiseach met Vice-President Gore at Shannon on 7 September.</P>
      <P>In my discussions with the President and Vice-President in Washington on 29 September, I emphasised the Government's belief that there is now a unique opportunity on the island of Ireland to consolidate peace and to achieve a lasting political settlement.  As always, I found the President and the Vice-President to be both very well informed and supportive of our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President and Vice-President reiterated that the United States will continue to look for ways to support the peace process and to encourage further progress, including through strong US support of the International Fund for Ireland and other efforts to promote economic development.  They indicated that the Administration was examining a range of possible options in this regard and would maintain close contact with <Col N="2111" /> both the Irish and British Governments. The support and goodwill of President Clinton and his Administration is an asset of enormous importance for both traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My discussions with congressional leaders also related primarily to Northern Ireland and to the prospects for achieving lasting peace in Ireland.  I expressed appreciation for their continuing support and interest.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to express to congressional leaders the hope of the Irish Government that Congress would adopt legislation allowing Ireland to qualify for visa waiver arrangements.  I know the House will share my pleasure that this measure was adopted on 7 October and will now go to the President for signature.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 55, 60 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 1 of Article 8b of the EC Treaty which was inserted by the Maastricht Treaty provides that every citizen of the Union residing in a member state of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the member state in which he resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that state.  Adult residents in Ireland have had this right regardless of nationality for over 30 years.</P>
      <P>The Treaty also provides that this right shall be exercised subject to detailed arrangements to be adopted before 31 December 1994 by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament; these arrangements may provide for derogations where warranted by problems.</P>
      <P>In February 1994, the Commission presented a draft Directive setting out the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the rights provided in Article 8b (1).  This draft Directive is under consideration by the Council of Ministers and is due to be considered by the European Parliament at its next session.  I expect that the Directive will be adopted by the end of the year as provided for in the Treaty.  Once the Directive is in force, member states will be obliged to implement the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive before I January 1996.  Irish citizens will then be entitled to stand and vote in municipal elections in the member states of which they are resident in accordance with the terms of the Directive.</P>

      <P>I will answer Questions Nos. 56 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to confirm to the House that on 7 October the United States Congress passed the Nationality and Naturalisation Amendments Bill which, when it comes into effect around the end of the year, will mean Ireland's inclusion in the US Visa Waiver Programme.  Irish passport-holders visiting the United States for tourism or business purposes for less then 90 days will then no longer be required to have a visa.  In the meantime the visa requirement remains but I am confident that the US Embassy will be as sensitive as possible in its treatment of applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government lobbied extremely actively to secure Ireland's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Programme.  I was personally very conscious of the anomaly whereby Ireland was one of only a few members of the European Union whose citizens were required to have visas to go to the US for short visits; on coming into office, I was determined to do everything possible to remove this anomaly.  During each of my visits to Washington, I strongly pressed our case for inclusion in the programme in meetings with key members of the Administration and of Congress.  I followed up these discussions by writing personally to each member of the Immigration <Col N="2114" /> Committee of the House of Representatives.  Our Embassy in Washington worked very hard throughout to help achieve a successful outcome.  My meetings in Washington in late September, when the House of Representatives had approved the new measure but discussions in the Senate were still pending, were particularly useful.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to place on public record the Government's deep appreciation of the efforts of our many friends, Democrats and Republicans, in the US Congress who supported this legislation.  We are very pleased that Irish visitors to the United States will now be treated in the same way as visitors from the majority of other European countries.</P>

      <P>During my meeting with Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, I devoted a considerable amount of time to human rights issues, including the question of Tibet.  I pointed out that Ireland and China and many other countries were able to agree last year at the UN Conference in Vienna on an important Declaration on Human Rights.  In that document we all accepted that, however different the political, economic and social systems of states, we all have a duty to uphold and protect the fundamental human rights which were set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  I outlined to the Vice Premier and Foreign Minister the degree of public concern in Ireland and in the European Union on human rights issues.  I raised with him the question of prisoners in Tibet and the case of the Chinese dissident Wei Jinsheng.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the implementation of the programme of action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo is shared between the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has responsibility in the international context and the Departmennt of Health which has responsibility for its implementation domestically.  Accordingly, I shall focus my reply on the international context.</P>
      <P>The programme of action agreed at the conference, which was attended by my colleagues, Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for Health, as head of delegation, and Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with special responsibility for development co-operation, is aimed primarily at securing improvements over a 20 year period in developing countries in the various areas under its remit. These include the empowerment of women, the rights of the family, reproductive health and the increased availability of family planning.  The programme of action estimates that the full implementation of the proposals which it contains will require US$17 billion in 2000, $5.7 billion of which needs to be provided by the international donor community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For our part, we are prepared to examine the question of increasing our financial contributions to support the goals outlined in the programme of action.  Ireland made voluntary contributions in 1993 and 1994 to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which runs extensive campaigns and assistance programmes in the field of population in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, which request its advice and assistance.  In 1993 our contribution to UNFPA was $50,000, and in 1994 this was increased to £150,000.  We would envisage that <Col N="2118" /> this amount will be increased in coming years.</P>
    <P>The question of Ireland becoming more directly involved in providing assistance on population issues in individual developing countries is being actively considered in the context of the current expansion of our Bilateral Aid Programme.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be actively participating in international discussions on the implementation of the programme of action in a number of international fora; in particular the General Assembly of the United Nations which will review the outcome of the Cairo conference during its current session, and also at a later stage in the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC), of which we are currently members.  In this connection the programme of action requests the General Assembly of the UN to organise a regular review of its implementation as well as to consider the administrative structure for population activities in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>A priority for Ireland in discussing implementation of the programme of action in international fora will be to support the principles and implementation guidelines adopted by the Development Council of the European Community in 1992.  These principles are: non-coercion and non-discrimination; observence of the rights of individuals and couples to choose the number and spacing of their children; the need to integrate population policies and development policies; attention must be paid to the needs of individuals, families and the wider community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland took up observer status in the Western European Union in November 1993 with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty.  Since then the Western European Union Ministerial Council, which holds regular meetings once every six months, has met twice &mdash; on 22 November, 1993 and on 9 May, 1994. Both meetings took place in Luxembourg.  The next Western European Union Ministerial Council meeting is scheduled for 14 November, 1994 in Noordwijk, in the Netherlands.  The Western European Union Council also meets at the level of ambassadors on a weekly basis, and Ireland's permanent representative to the Western European Union, Mr. Patrick Cradock, attends these meetings.</P>
      <P>At the Western European Union Ministerial Council meeting on 22 November, 1993, Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea.  The main issue discussed was the implications for the Western European Union of the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, represented Ireland at the Western European Union Ministerial Council in Luxembourg on 9 May, 1994.  The main subject was the Western European Union's relations with the nine Central and Eastern European countries that have, or will have Association Agreements with the EU.  The Western European Union decided to enhance its relations with these countries by offering them &ldquo;associate partner&rdquo; status.  I have arranged for copies of the conclusions of both meetings to be placed <Col N="2120" /> in the Dáil Library for the information of Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to attend the next Western European Union Ministerial Council meeting which is scheduled to take place in Noordwijk, in the Netherlands, on 14 November, 1994.</P>
    <P>The question of attendance by the Minister of Defence or officials from the Department of Defence, or of Irish military personnel, at meetings of the Western European Union Ministerial Council, has not arisen to date.  This is due both to the nature of Ireland's observer status at the Western European Union, which reflects the relationship established between the European Union and the Western European Union in the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, and also to the nature of the issues which have been considered at these meetings.</P>
    <P>A joint discussion between the Western European Union and NATO Councils takes place at ambassadorial level twice a year.  As an observer at the Western European Union Council, Ireland is entitled to observe these sessions and the Ambassador, Mr. Cradock, attended the last such meeting on 29 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The core objectives of the International Fund for Ireland are to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.  Its structures provide for regular consultation with the Irish and British Governments while, at the same time, ensuring that the fund chairman <Col N="2121" /> and board are fully independent in discharging their mandate.  This quality of independence has greatly contributed to the success of the fund, particularly in regard to its acceptance by both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board is currently considering the role and direction of the fund in the context of the developing peace process and the prospect of additional financial resources being made available.  While the fund's advisory committee, comprising officials from both Governments, will assist it in its deliberations, it is ultimately a matter for the independent chairman and board to determine the fund's future role in the new circumstances which apply on the island.</P>
      <P>The fund's resources derive from the generous financial support provided by the United States, the European Union, Canada and New Zealand.  The Deputy will be aware that in recent weeks there has been a number of positive developments in regard to additional finance for the fund.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has proposed that the planned EU contribution to the fund should be increased from 15 million ECU to 20 million ECU for each of the next three years.  The enabling draft Regulation is currently being considered by the Council of Ministers and I will be working to ensure that it is formally adopted before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, during the Taoiseach's recent visit to Australia, Prime Minister Keating announced that his Government would commit $7 million Australian dollars to the fund over the next five years.  This first Australian contribution to the fund represents a very significant broadening of international support for the peace process.  In addition, in the presence of the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Bolger recently announced that New Zealand had allocated a third tranche of support to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US Congress has agreed on a further United States contribution of $20 million to the fund in 1995.  The <Col N="2122" /> question of increasing the existing level of US support to the fund is currently being considered within the administration as part of the President's wider package of support for the peace process.</P>
    <P>I availed of my recent meetings with President Clinton, Vice-President Gore, Secretary of State Christopher and senior congressional figures to make the case for additional resources being made available to the fund at this critical time.  The very tight budgetary constraints in the United States imposes certain limitations on the administration's ability to sponsor a substantial increase in its contribution.  I am nevertheless hopeful that it will be possible for the United States to contemplate some increase in its assistance to the fund.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply appreciative of the substantial international support which the fund has attracted.  Such financial assistance is a very tangible demonstration of the goodwill which exists internationally for the current peace process.  The Government will continue to avail of every opportunity to consolidate and, where possible, increase that level of support for the fund.</P>

      <P>The Treaty providing for the accession to the European Union of Austria, Sweden, Finland and <Col N="2123" /> Norway was signed in Corfu on 24 June, 1994, by the member states of the European Union and by the four accession countries.  Under the terms of the Accession Treaty the member states of the European Union and the four accession countries undertake to complete their ratification procedures by 31 December, 1994.  The Treaty will enter into force on 1 January, 1995, for all four accession countries and these countries will become members of the European Union provided that their instruments of ratification and those of the existing member states have been deposited before that date.</P>
      <P>However, Article 2 of the Accession Treaty has addressed the possibility that not all the accession countries will be in a position to ratify the Accession Treaty by 31 December, 1994.  In the event of an accession country being unable to ratify, the Council of the European Union, acting unanimously, is permitted to make the necessary adjustments to the Accession Treaty to take account of this.  The Accession Treaty will enter into force for those accession countries that can ratify.  It will not be necessary to renegotiate the Accession Treaty.</P>
      <P>Ireland's ratification of the Accession Treaty providing for the accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway involves, <i>inter alia</i>, an amendment to the European Communities Acts, 1972 to 1993 and passage through the Dáil of a resolution approving the terms of the Accession Treaty.  The European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which was published at the beginning of August, will be debated in this House shortly.</P>

      <P>The European Council at its meeting in Corfu on 24-25 June 1994 agreed to establish a Reflection Group of Personal Representatives of Foreign Ministers and the President of the Commission to prepare for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  The European Council also agreed that two representatives of the European Parliament could participate in the work of the group.  The group will be chaired by a person appointed by the Spanish Government and will begin its work in June 1995.  The Reflection Group will report in time for the meeting of the European Council at the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>The Reflection Group will examine and elaborate ideas relating to the provisions of the Treaty on European Union for which a revision is foreseen and other possible improvements.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>In view of the historic development of recent weeks I believe that there is now a major opportunity to resolve the problem of closed cross-Border roads. The Government has therefore welcomed the decisions taken to date to rescind closure orders on 16 Border crossings, and the announcement that a review of all road closures is under way. With regard to the problems facing local communities in the areas referred to by the Deputies, and along the Border generally, it has been made clear to the British authorities that this issue must continue to receive priority attention.  I have therefore emphasised to the Secretary of State the importance of ensuring that the review is concluded as rapidly as possible and that it leads to a programme of re-openings in all of the affected areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rebuilding of bridges and other works arising out of the re-openings, discussions are already under way between officials from both sides on different aspects of the many technical and practical matters which need attention as re-openings take place.  I can assure the Deputies that I will be keeping progress on this, as on all matters relating to the road closures problem, under close review within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The possible introduction of a national identity card is a complex issue which would require in-depth debate; its introduction could not be justified simply as a low cost alternative to a passport.  The standard fee of £45 for an Irish passport, valid for ten years, does not compare unfavourably with the European Union average.  The Irish fee is about half way down the EU cost table; in six other member states the comparable fee is higher while in five it is lower.</P>
      <P>Given the travel patterns of Irish people, a high proportion would continue to require a passport with worldwide validity even if a separate document for EU travel were available.  The administrative difficulties involved in the production of dual travel documents would be unlikely to be justified in cost-benefit terms.</P>
      <P>The general issue of co-operation with EU partners on freedom of movement and immigration control is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice.  Measures to give full effect to the freedom of movement provisions in the Maastricht Treaty have yet to be adopted by the EU.  The use of passports, as distinct from national identity cards, has not emerged as an issue in the context of implementation of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>The European Union and its member states have been the main contributors to the international relief operation, providing over 690 million ECU since the start of the <Col N="2128" /> conflict in 1991.  Sixty-five per cent of the aid administration by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been provided by the European Union and its member states.  This year alone the EU has contributed almost US$65 million in cash and in kind to the UN joint agencies appeal, more than half of the total donated.  The EU and its member states have also made national contributions to intergovernmental agencies and NGOs.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that humanitarian needs are being met at present.  I will, with my EU colleagues, work to ensure that adequate food and medical aid is available as winter approaches.</P>
      <P>EU member states have also responded with great sensitivity and generosity to the plight of refugees and displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia.  They decided in 1992 to provide temporary admission to particularly vulnerable persons, in addition to the normal procedures for political asylum.  According to information supplied by the UNHCR, EU member states have offered temporary protection to some 12,350 cases out of a total of 26,850 processed.  Of the 1,367 patients who have benefited from the programme of medical evacuation organised by the UNHCR and International Organisation for Migration, 547 have been given treatment in EU countries, including 35 in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Given the flexible approach that the EU has adopted, I do not see a need to amend long-established asylum procedures for asylum, which are governed by international humanitarian law, in order to meet the particular circumstances of the former Yugoslavia.</P>

As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on this matter on 30 June, Ireland's usual policy on appointments of this nature is to seek consensus by the European Union in favour of a single candidate.  This consensual approach is particularly important in the case of the WTO given the significance of international trade to the Irish and European economies.

      <P>As far as is practicable, the passport fee structure is designed to accommodate potential hardship cases.  Since September 1992 there has been a concession to people over 65 years of age who, instead of paying £45 for a standard ten-year passport, may instead obtain a passport valid for three years for £10.</P>
      <P>The exemption of unemployed persons from passport fees would be problematic in terms of revenue loss and also in terms of the comparative position between the unemployed and low paid workers.  For those to whom the £45 fee represents a significant burden, I would point out that the low season cost reduction, under which persons applying during the months of October and November can obtain a full ten-year passport for £35, is currently in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>The driver referred to was arrested by French police near St. Etienne on 5 August 1994 and charged with endangering public safety by driving on over-weight vehicle on a weight-restricted road.  On 8 August a court found him guilty and the truck was confiscated.</P>
      <P>Since this case came to our attention my Department and the embassy in Paris have done everything possible to assist the owners and the driver of the truck.  We have been in contact with the French Ministry of Transport, the judicial authorities, the police and the lawyer acting for the driver.  These contacts have resulted in the appeal hearing being expedited and it is now scheduled for 18 November.  Appeals in France normally can take up to two years.</P>
      <P>The charge against the driver was brought under the new French Penal Code which came into effect this year. The French authorities maintain that the weight restriction applying on the road in question has been clearly signposted since 1991 and that this, together with concerns voiced by local residents after eight deaths in the area involving trucks in the past three years, explains the strict approach of the police and the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2132" /> The Department, through our embassy in Paris, will continue monitoring the case closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my replies to earlier questions to-day, I had the opportunity to set out in detail the objectives which the Government is pursuing with regard to Bosnia and Rwanda.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the European Union and its member states, together with the United Nations, have been deeply involved in the search for a negotiated settlement, in helping on the ground to create the climate for negotiations, and in the alleviation of the suffering of displaced persons and other victims of the conflict.  The European Union and its member states are the main contributors to the international relief operation in former Yugoslavia, having provided over 690 MECU to the international relief effort.  This includes 65 per cent of the funding required to date by the UNHCR.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports an active and effective engagement by both the European Union and the United Nations in Bosnia and elsewhere in former Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace process is being pursued through the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia which is co-chaired by the European Union and the <Col N="2133" /> United Nations.  Its Contact Group is playing a leading role in the current efforts to secure a settlement in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>The some 40,000 strong UN Protection Force, UNPROFOR, is the largest UN peacekeeping operation ever deployed.  EU member states are contributing 14,500 personnel to UNPROFOR, which is playing a vital role in dampening the conflict, promoting local ceasefires, protecting the vital aid convoys which bring assistance to the 2.3 million displaced persons, and in providing protection to those in the beleaguered towns and enclaves.  I very much welcome the fact that UNPROFOR's mandate was recently renewed by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland is playing its part fully in the efforts on the ground in former Yugoslavia to promote peace and assist the victims of conflict.  Thirty Defence Forces personnel and Garda Síochána are serving with UNPROFOR and a further four have been assigned to the International Conference Mission which is monitoring the closure of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's border with the Bosnian Serb-held lands.  Six Defence Forces personnel are serving with the EC Monitor Mission and a further two with the EC Humanitarian Aid Task Force.  Two customs officers are working with the CSCE Sanctions Assistance Mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in Bosnia hold out the prospects for peace.  If an overall settlement is secured, I expect that the Security Council will consider what role UNPROFOR might play in implementation.  Should the Secretary-General approach Ireland in this regard, the Government will give his request careful consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to Rwanda I would first say that in my statement to the UN General <Col N="2134" /> Assembly on 28 September I made several recommendations which were designed to achieve a more effective response from the UN towards preventing and dealing with situations similar to the horror of Rwanda.  These sought to improve the capabilities of the UN in areas such as early warning and mediation, peacekeeping, the human rights area, international criminal law, the causes of conflicts and control of traffic in arms.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a strong role in urging EU involvement in Rwanda &mdash; for instance it was at Ireland's instigation that the recent EU troika mission was sent to Rwanda and the neighbouring countries.  From that visit, the recently approved EU common position on Rwanda evolved.</P>
    <P>In Rwanda at present the UNAMIR peacekeeping force has nearly reached its authorised level of 5,500 troops. Over 60 Defence Forces personnel are working in a voluntary capacity with the UNHCR and with the Irish aid agencies.  There is no proposal before the UN Security Council to alter the mandate of UNAMIR to that of a peace enforcement mission.</P>

      <P>At the 1996 InterGovernmental Conference (IGC) the member states of the European Union will examine the basic treaties established in the Union and the changes which it may be necessary to make to the institutional structures, taking account of the possibility of a further enlargement of the Union to include a number of countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Over the next year, in the period leading up to the Intergovernmental Conference, the Government will be considering the prospects for the conference, the proposals which are likely to emerge and the positions which Ireland should adopt in relation to those proposals.  The White Paper on Foreign Policy which I announced earlier this year and which is to be based on widespread public consultation will be an important part of that process of policy development.</P>
      <P>In this perspective, I have read with interest the statements made by Prime Minister Balladur in an interview in <i>Le Figaro</i> on 31 August and the policy paper released by the CDU-CSU parties in the German Bundestag on 1 September.  There have also been other presentations of interest including the speech made by Prime Minister Major in the Netherlands on 7 September.</P>
      <P>I regard all of these as interesting contributions to the public debate within the Union on the further development of the process of European integration which will be the subject of detailed discussion and negotiation at the 1996 ITC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained we in Ireland are at the beginning of a process of widespread public consultation which I intend will culminate in the publication of a White Paper in the first half of next year.  I can say even at this stage that successive Irish Governments have taken the view that it is important to maintain a common approach by member states to the process of European integration and have felt that this is best <Col N="2138" /> done by commitment by all to implement common policies.</P>

      <P>The US embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations between the United States and Cuba, instituted in 1962, does not preclude other countries from developing trade and commercial links with Cuba, nor has it prevented the provision of humanitarian aid to Cuba. Ireland has therefore been of the view that in general the normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba is essentially a bilateral matter best addressed between the two Governments concerned although we have opposed the extra-territorial dimension to the embargo introduced by the United States &ldquo;Cuban Democracy Act&rdquo; of 1992.</P>
      <P>I regret, nevertheless, both the continuing poor relations between the United States and Cuba and the circumstances which underlie the situation.  I have already said in relation to this issue that it is my hope that the changes which have occurred in international relations in recent years will create the conditions for an end to Cold War animosities everywhere.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly concerned about the recent disimprovement of the situation in Cuba as evidenced by the exodus from that country during August and early September of large numbers of people on rafts and unseaworthy boats seeking refuge in the United States.  Ireland has supported the provision of substantial humanitarian aid by the European Union to alleviate the plight of the Cuban people.  I welcome the recent agreement between the United States and Cuba on the immigration issue which appears to have established a basis for resolving the refugee crises and hope that the progress made in this area will also contribute to an improvement in the climate for relations between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the embargo is likely to come up for consideration shortly <Col N="2140" /> during the current session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and I will take account of the changed circumstances in considering Ireland's position on the issue in that context.</P>

      <P>On 16 February 1994, Greece closed the port of Salonika to traffic to and from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the exception of humanitarian transport. This decision was taken without consultation with the Commission or the member states.</P>
      <P>The measures taken by the Greek Government have an impact on Community trade policy, particularly in so far as it relates to the freedom of movement of goods.</P>
      <P>The blockade by a member state against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a matter of considerable concern both to the Commission and to other member states.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of attempts at mediation, the Commission on 13 April 1994 initiated legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice against the Greek Government to force it to put an end to the embargo.  In a preliminary judgment, the court did not order the suspension of the embargo pending an examination of the complex legal issues involved.</P>

      <P>A survey of staffing structures in the Passport Office, conducted by the Department of Finance last year, recommended an increase in the permanent staff of the Passport Office from 48 to 82, and a maximum peak season temporary staff of 54.  The recommendations of the Department of Finance report were accepted on the basis that an increased level of permanent staffing would help ensure that the Passport Office was better equipped to deal with demand on a year-round basis.</P>
      <P>As part of the implementation of these recommendations it was agreed, following discussions with the Department of Finance and the union representing the temporary clerical assistants, that six of the new permanent posts would be filled by confined competition among the temporary staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>It was initially understood that the interviews for these posts would be organised by my Department and applications were invited from the temporary clerical assistants on this basis. However, it was subsequently clarified that the Civil Service Commission, which has responsibility for appointments to established positions in the Civil Service, was the appropriate body to hold the interviews.  Accordingly a competition among the temporary clerical assistants was organised by the Civil Service Commission and the six appointments have now been made.</P>
      <P>The agreement to appoint six temporary clerical assistants to permanent positions in my Department has been adhered to in full.  In particular, it was not part of the agreement that a panel of candidates would be established for any future vacancies that might arise in the Passport Office.</P>

      <P>Following the decision to establish Uganda as a partner country for Irish Aid, an amount of £1.1 million was allocated for the bilateral aid programme in Uganda in 1994. It is anticipated that this assistance will be doubled in 1995.</P>
      <P>Irish Aid programmes in developing countries are carried out in consultation with the authorities in the partner country.  In line with this policy, discussions were held with the Ugandan Government prior to the setting up of the Irish aid programme there this year.  Following these discussions it was agreed that the main thrust of the Irish aid programme in Uganda would focus on an area based rural development programme in the Kibaale district of Uganda.</P>
      <P>This programme has five main components: capacity building, water and sanitation, access, health infrastructure and primary education.  The objective of the health component of the project is to improve the health infrastructure of the district.  This will be achieved through the rehabilitation of the district hospital and rural clinics.  Sanitation and the provision of clean water also form an important part of the project. According to IFAD statistics the major health problems in the region are malaria, acute respiratory infections, intestinal infestation and diarrhoea.</P>
      <P>While the project is not therefore specifically targeted at AIDS and HIV sufferers the overall improvement in the quality and availability of sanitation, health care and education in the district which is envisaged by the project should have a positive effect in this area.</P>

      <P>This conference on interregional co-operation between the European Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was held at the initiative of the German Presidency in Berlin on 5 and 6 September 1994.  Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.  The eleven members of SADC were represented at the conference including South Africa which has recently joined the organisation.</P>
      <P>The conference agreed to reinforce the relationship between the two regions and to establish a comprehensive dialogue which would increase co-operation over a broad range of areas. These areas include political dialogue, regional integration, trade and economic co-operation, investment, development co-operation, natural resources and the environment, science and technology, tourism, cultural co-operation and the combating of international crime.  A copy of the Declaration issued by the conference has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the conference will result in greater region-to-region co-operation between the EU and SADC <Col N="2146" /> in the political, economic and development co-operation fields.</P>
    <P>Many delegations, including Ireland, expressed the hope that the dialogue would make a real contribution to peace, security and stability in the Southern Africa region.  The Southern African states were urged to establish mechanisms to secure peace and stability in the long run.  The steps already taken to formalise security co-operation within the new SADC were welcomed as an indication that Southern Africa has already put conflict resolution on its agenda.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with other delegations, stressed the importance of developing follow-up mechanisms that will enable real progress to be made.  The next meeting of the conference at ministerial level will take place in South Africa towards the end of 1995, and a preparatory meeting of senior officials will be held in Malawi early in 1995.</P>

      <P>The amount provided in 1993 under Subhead C of the International Co-operation Vote (payment to Grant-in-Aid Fund for Bilateral and other Aid) was £15.3 million.  To this was added a further £438,771 carried forward from the previous year, giving a total available in the Bilateral Aid Fund for the Year 1993 of £15.738 million.</P>
      <P>Some of our bilateral aid expenditure arises at headquarters and some in the field.  To facilitate field expenditure, moneys are transferred by way of imprests at regular intervals to our Development Co-operation Offices (DCOs) in priority aid countries abroad.  The Department's concern is to ensure that there will always be a sufficiency of funds in these overseas accounts to maintain the continuity of our aid programmes in these countries.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the total moneys issued from the Bilateral Aid Fund through a combination of expenditure at Headquarters and transfers to the Development Co-operation Offices was £17.542 million thus exceeding the total available in the Fund by £1.804 million.  Of this latter amount, however, some £1.359 million was not expended in the normal sense but remained under the control of the Department at the end of the financial year in DCO and Bilateral Aid Project accounts abroad.</P>

      <P>Crew cab vehicles which are of not more than three tonnes unladen weight and which, to the rear of the driver's seat, have a roofed area in which one or more seats have been fitted are classified as Category A vehicles for VRT purposes.  Such vehicles are chargeable at the rate of 23.2 per cent of the value of the vehicle, if the engine capacity is 2,500ccs or less, and at the rate of 29.25 per cent of the value of the vehicle if <Col N="2150" /> the engine capacity exceeds 2,500ccs. Vehicles with crew cabs which are over three tonnes unladen weight are chargeable to VRT at the standard commercial vehicles rate of £40.  The smaller vehicles are used mainly for the purpose of the carriage of passengers with some equipment, while the larger category is used mainly for the carriage of heavy goods and equipment.  The three tonne limit is considered to be a reasonable threshold for distinguishing between the two types of vehicles given their essentially different functions.

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the comment by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 1993 report in relation to the 15 per cent incentive amnesty that he had noted that there was a <i>de facto</i> extension to the payment deadline for those who presented cheques subsequently dishonoured and replacement cheques were being accepted up to the date of his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that section 7 (3) (a) of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, placed the special collection functions under the control and direction of the chief special collector who had to cope with the large scale operation involved.  The chief special collector had to undertake that task with limited staff resources, for confidentiality reasons, and without <Col N="2151" /> access to Revenue's ordinary collection processing systems.</P>
    <P>It is understood that, of the £200 million paid to the chief special collector by the deadline, only cheques to the value of £1.5 million had to be returned to taxpayers for various reasons including cheques being dishonoured by the banks.  Of those cheques returned, cheques valued at £0.9 million were made good in agreement with the chief special collector.  No response was received in respect of cheques totalling £0.6 million and the persons involved were treated as non-amnesty cases.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate the precise operations carried out in the office of the chief special collector.  Because of the huge volume of declarations not all had been acknowledged and given a reference number by the payment date of 14 January, 1994.  The chief special collector advised that payments should be made by 14 January, whether or not they bore a reference number.  More than 37,500 payments had subsequently to be matched with earlier declarations and the cheques banked.  Given the time needed to complete this operation there was inevitably a delay in lodging all of the cheques although, as the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General points out, 96.5 per cent were lodged within four weeks of the payment date. In these circumstances where cheques were dishonoured &mdash; for example because funds in accounts had in the interim been drawn down for other purposes &mdash; the chief special collector allowed the person concerned the opportunity to remedy the deficiency promptly.</P>
    <P>I am assured that, in all the circumstances, taking into account, particularly, the very large number of transactions which had to be processed, this was a reasonable approach by the chief special collector in directing the special collection functions under the amnesty legislation.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have a number of programmes in place to counter evasion by landlords and to ensure that they make correct returns of rental income. The special inquiry branch in the greater Dublin area and the local enquiry units in provincial districts focus on this issue.</P>
      <P>The main focus is on the building up of registers of landlords and rental properties.  The registers are built up from an ongoing examination of a variety of information sources, e.g. electoral registers and street directories, newspaper articles and advertisements in relation to property and information obtained directly from forms completed by third parties such as tenants and letting agents, from local authorities and from the public.</P>
      <P>In addition, special inquiry branch in Dublin conducted 529 visits in connection with rental income in the period 1 January-30 September, 1994.  In recently planned operations, the branch targeted and visited a number of localities in the greater Dublin area with a high incidence of rental occupation and sought details of rental income received by landlords.  Further such operations are planned for the future.</P>
      <P>In the years 1992 and 1993, special inquiry branch programmes in relation to rental income in the greater Dublin area identified 366 and 369 landlords respectively who were not declaring some or all of their rental income.  The comparable figure for the first nine months of 1994 is 269 landlords.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 143 and 145 together.  PRSI contributions in respect of self-employed people are payable on income (subject to certain exceptions and deductions) from all sources as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts, provided the total income is in excess of £2,500 a <Col N="2156" /> year.  PRSI contributions establish a personal entitlement to contributory old age pension and to contributory Survivor's and orphan's pension.</P>
      <P>The maintenance payments which the person concerned receives from her husband are, therefore, reckonable for PRSI contributions.  To exempt such payments from liability for contributions could involve excluding many persons in this situation from social insurance cover and possible entitlement to social insurance pensions.  I am considering whether any changes are warranted in the present arrangements taking account of the need for adequate social insurance cover and for equity as between different family units.</P>

      <P>Means for unemployment assistance are assessed under the provisons of the Social Welfare Acts and regulations.  The basis of assessment set out in the legislation is different from business practice &mdash; for example depreciation of fixed assets such as farm buildings is not allowed.  Accordingly statements of accounts prepared for business purposes cannot be used as the sole basis for means assessment.  Such accounts are however of assistance to investigators, deciding and appeals officers and are a welcome source of information wherever available.</P>

These meetings have included such issues as mutual administrative assistance in relation to disability benefit, invalidity pension and family income supplement and cross-Border control of fraud.  The community and voluntary services side of my Department is involved in supporting a number of cross-Border community development initiatives.  Only last week, I launched a co-operative venture between Lifford and Derry.  Cross-Border projects in which we are involved included the Lifestart Foundation, based in Galway, which runs an innovative home-based intervention programme &mdash; targeted at children aged 0-5 years and their parents and which currently operates on a pilot basis in south Connemara, Westside in Galway and Ballymagroarty in Derry.</P>
      <P>My Department is also funding the Holywell Trust in Derry to provide community development training and support servives for projects in the Department's Community Development Programme in the north-west region.  I have also recently approved the inclusion of Community Connections &mdash; a cross-Border community development project based in Blacklion, County Cavan and which operates in west Fermanagh, west Cavan and north Leitrim &mdash; in the Community Development Programme with a start-up allocation of £10,000 in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> Deputy Joan Burton, Minister of State at my Department, recently hosted the Focus on Children joint North/South Conference in Dublin and Belfast.  The conference was organised to mark the International Year of the Family by voluntary organisations who work in the child care area.  She has also met with a number of cross-Border organisations/groups in her capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for anti-poverty programmes.</P>
    <P>I have also been involved in the very important work which is being done by the Ireland Funds in Northern Ireland and the Republic.</P>

      <P>The Holiday (Employees) Acts, 1973-1991 provide for entitlement to nine public holidays. There is no entitlement under labour legislation to payment for bank holidays <Col N="2165" /> as such but, with the exception of Good Friday, all bank holidays are also designated as public holidays.</P>
      <P>The Acts provide that, in respect of a public holiday, most full-time and part-time employees are entitled to receive from their employer:</P>
      <P>(i)  a paid day off on that day, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  a paid day off within a month, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  an extra day's annual leave or</P>
      <P>(iv)  an extra day's pay</P>
      <P>as the employer may decide.</P>
      <P>In the case of day to day and certain part-time employments, the employee must have worked for the employer for at least 120 hours (110 if the employee is under 18 years) during the five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday in order to qualify for public holiday entitlement from the employer.</P>
      <P>An employee who qualifies for public holidays under the Acts must be given, by the employer, one of the four options set out at (i)-(iv) above, as the employer may decide.  Any employee who considers that his/her employer has not complied with the holidays legislation in respect of public holiday entitlement may refer a complaint to my Department.  My Department will investigate the complaint and, where necessary, legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer.</P>
      <P>The question of entitlement to payment from the Department of Social Welfare in respect of bank holidays is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Shaw Bridge is located on a regional road, responsibility for its maintenance and for any necessary improvement works is a matter for Kildare County Council using its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary State grants allocated to the council.  These grants amount to £1.893 million in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Kildare County Council first sought a special grant in respect of Shaw Bridge as part of a general submission on bridge works which was made to my Department in 1985. Due to the limited provision for such grants, and the competing demands from other projects, it was not possible to make an allocation for improvement works to the bridge in the intervening years.  However, a special grant of <Col N="2167" /> £17,500 was paid to the council in 1988 for site investigations and the preparation of a preliminary report, but without commitment to further funding.</P>
    <P>The practice of providing special grants has been discontinued with effect from 1 January, 1994, and support for non-national roads is now made available to local authorities by way of discretionary grants and by way of specific grants under a new EU co-financed scheme for improvement works which are important for employment or which promote economic activity.  Kildare County Council's initial submission for EU co-financed grants for specific improvement works which was made on 25 February, 1994, related to 18 projects, including Shaw Bridge.  As the total cost of these projects (£18.7 million) was excessive, compared with the guideline amount previously indicated, the council's submission was returned for amendment.  Subsequently, the council sought specific grants for five projects; Shaw Bridge was not included.</P>
    <P>It is open to Kildare County Council to consider whether to apply for funding in 1995 under the specific improvements grants scheme for Shaw Bridge having regard to the conditions governing the scheme.  I understand that the estimated cost of improvements to the bridge is £800,000.</P>

      <P>Section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954, provides as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  If an officer thinks himself wronged in any matter by any superior or other officer, including his commanding officer, he may complain thereof to his commanding officer and if, but only if, his commanding officer does not deal with <Col N="2177" /> the complaint to such officer's satisfaction, he may complain in the prescribed manner to the Minister who shall inquire into the complaint and give his directions thereon.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any man thinks himself wronged in any matter by any officer, other than his company commander, or by any man he may complain thereof to his company commander, and if he thinks himself wronged by his company commander either in respect of his complaint not being redressed or in respect of any other matter, he may complain thereof to his commanding officer, and if he thinks himself wronged by his commanding officer, either in respect of his complaint not being redressed or in respect of any other matter, he may complain thereof in the prescribed manner to the Adjutant General, who, if so required by the man, shall report on the matter of the complaint to the Minister who shall inquire into the complaint and give his directions thereon.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every officer to whom a complaint is made in pursuance of this section shall cause such complaint to be inquired into, and shall, if on inquiry he is satisfied of the justice of the complaint so made, take such steps as may be necessary for giving full redress to the complainant in respect of the matter complained of, and shall in every case inform the complainant in the prescribed manner as to what action has been taken in respect of the matter complained of.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 70 of the Defence Force Regulations R.5 &mdash; An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil &mdash; and Paragraph 80 of the Defence Force Regulations R.6 &mdash; An Slua Muirí &mdash; provide that the procedures governing the submission and transmission of complaints outlined in Defence Force Regulations A.7 &mdash; Discipline, Part II, Sections 9 to 11B, Redress of Wrongs, shall apply to members of the FCA and Slua Muirí.  In summary these procedures are:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2178" /> (a)  In the case of an officer he may complain orally or in writing to his commanding officer and if not satisfied may forward the complaint in writing to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Other ranks may complain orally or in writing to their company commanders and if not satisfied to their commanding officers.  If not yet satisfied they may complain in writing to the Adjutant-General and finally to the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b)  Each authority is obliged to have the complaint investigated and, if satisfied as to the justice of the complaint, to take, without delay, such steps as lie within his power and as may be necessary for giving full redress to the complainant in the matter complained of.  Alternatively, where such authority is forwarding a complaint to the next highest authority he is obliged to attach a statement of his views on the matter and of the steps, if any, taken by him towards having redress given to the complainant.</P>
    <P>(c)  In every case where a complaint has been made to the Minister, the complainant shall be informed of the Minister's decision.  If he so requests the decision should be conveyed in writing by the commanding officer. The decision of the Minister on any complaint is final.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces the current procedures for dealing with grievances are under review.  With regard to the Permanent Defence Force this matter is being considered under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  A sub-committee of the Conciliation Council has been established to consider the grievance procedure and to produce a report which will identify current problems, consider the question of time limits and submit recommendations.  The work of the sub-committee is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the conciliation <Col N="2179" /> and arbitration scheme agreed with the PDF Representative Associations in relation to confidentiality it is not appropriate to give details of discussions which are taking place under the scheme.  However, I understand that a comprehensive exchange of views has already taken place and these are now being considered by both sides of the sub-committee.  When discussions have been finalised a council report recording agreement will be drawn up by the conciliation council.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second line reserve, the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association will be consulted on the revision of the redress of wrongs-grievance procedures once negotiations on the matter involving the associations which represent members of the Permanent Defence Force are complete.</P>
    <P>The statistical information sought in the second, third, fourth and fifth parts of the question will take some time to compile.  A detailed statement setting out the information sought will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply on 12 October to Parliamentary Question No. 199 tabled by Deputy Philip Hogan, I will be having all the proposals evaluated over the coming months.

    <P>Delay in making this payment has arisen because the person named applied for grants under the June 1993 suckler cow premium scheme for smallscale milk producers but was not entitled to grants under that scheme because he does not hold a suckler cow quota and the animals on which he applied for premium were ineligible Friesians.

      <P>The person named applied for premium on ten cows under the 1993 suckler cow scheme, seven of which were Friesians.  Under the terms and conditions of the suckler cow scheme only applicants who were paid on certain breeds such as Friesians in 1990 and 1991 could be paid on these type animals in 1993.  The person named had not applied at all in 1990 or 1991, however, and so could be paid premium on only those three of the ten cows applied on in 1993 that were not Friesian cows.  As she was inadvertently paid an advance of £474.54 on 4 December 1993 on ten cows and as this amount exceeded the £237.27 total due in respect of the three eligible cows, I am afraid that the resulting overpayment will have to be refunded or deducted from future payments.</P>

      <P>The person named has been deemed ineligible for grants under the January-February 1993 special beef premium scheme because he applied for premium on an animal which was not in his ownership and possession on the date of application as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme.  This animal had been slaughtered a few days previously.  I understand that the person named was advised by my Department not to apply on this animal so there is an indication in his case of an intentional false declaration.

      <P>I believe it is important to encourage breeders of sports horses to register their foals. With a view to providing a more expeditious and efficient registration services, new computer facilities have been installed in the Irish Horse Register.  Some temporary difficulties arose with the installation of the new facilities and this has resulted in some delays in the foal registrations.  These problems have been resolved and it is expected that the backlog of applications will be cleared within the next two to three weeks.  New staff have been seconded permanently to the Horse Board and they are being temporarily augmented in order to expedite the clearance of the arrears.  To help further in this regard it has been decided to limit for a short period of times during which staff would be available to deal with enquiries from the public to the hours of 9.30 a.m. 11.30 a.m.</P>

    <P>The target date for entry into force of the Agreement is 1 January 1995.  Current indications are that a substantial number of countries &mdash; including major international traders such as the European Union, the USA and Japan &mdash; will have ratified the Agreement by the end of this year.  This would justify a decision by the intergovernmental Implementation Conference, which is <Col N="2197" /> due to be held in December, to confirm the date of 1 January as the date of entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 92 on 11 October, I hope that the Dáil will shortly approve a motion approving the terms of the Agreement, following which the Government will arrange to formally ratify it on behalf of Ireland.  As I also indicated in that reply, the process of ratification by the European Union is in progress and should be completed by the 1 January target date.</P>

      <P>As a result of significant productivity deal negotiated in 1992, Bord Gáis has provided enhanced benefits to the workforce affected by that agreement.  This productivity scheme which was self-financing brought the level of benefits for employees up to that of other public service sector schemes.

While changes in the pension scheme would be a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann in the first instance I understand that the cost of providing enhanced benefits to former employees who retired prior to the 1992 Agreement would be extremely expensive and could not be justified.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the fact that the European Commission has approved State investments in the airlines of France, Greece and Portugal.  The scale of the investments approved and the investments approved and the conditions attaching to such investments vary from country to country.</P>
      <P>In so far as regional services are concerned, the European Commission has informed me that its decision of March 1993 in relation to TAP referred to compensation for losses made since 1978 by TAP for carrying out public service obligations on the routes to the Atlantic islands of Azores and Madeira. The Portuguese Azores are at present excluded from the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2408/92 of 23 July 1992, and on the routes to Madeira, TAP has an exclusive concession which will expire in 1995.  The European Commission has advised me that the Portugese Government agreed to apply the Third Phase of Liberalisation and Licensing of Air Carriers (the &ldquo;Third Package&rdquo;) rules to the Atlantic islands as of 1 January 1996 despite the fact that the islands are formally excluded from the Package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Greek Government's investment in Olympic Airways, the European Commission has informed me that this is partly aimed at compensating losses made by Olympic Airways in carrying out public service obligations on behalf of the State.  The European Commission has indicated that the Greek islands are, for the time being, excluded from the application of the Third Package.  The Commission has also informed me that the Greek <Col N="2199" /> Government has accepted that the abrogation for the Greek islands currently included in the Third Package shall end on 30 June 1996.</P>
    <P>In relation to Air France, the Commission has advised me that it cannot use the State aid rules to open up domestic French routes to competition because this would be a misuse of power.</P>
    <P>In so far as regional services in Ireland are concerned, an Essential Air Services Programme for the regional airports is being introduced by the Government in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Council Regulation 2408/92.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been received from a number of air carriers to operate routes between the regional airports and Dublin Airport.

      <P>The basic light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely (via the Harcourt Street line) and Ballymun and would cost approximately £300 million to implement.  Possibilities for further extensions to the basic network will also be reported on in the final <Col N="2200" /> report of the DTI which will be published shortly.  However, the basic network cannot be constructed within the EU and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the National Development Plan.  Moreover, a longer time frame than that of the Plan, which covers the period from 1994 to 1999, will be needed to complete the basic network.  The National Development Plan proposals for light rail were framed on that basis; some press reports have wrongly implied that the reduction in overall EU funding which emerged after publication of the Plan resulted in a scaling back of the original light rail proposals.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective is to have two priority phases of the Dublin light rail network constructed during the period of the National Development Plan at an estimated cost of £200 million.  In this context my Department in conjunction with a high level Project team in CIE have for some time been engaged in detailed planning and preparatory work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links recommended by DTI to be constructed during the period of the National Development Plan on the basis of a number of criteria, including financial performance, congestion alleviation, environmental impact and ease of construction. All the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are co-operating in this work.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision in due course on the two priority phases to be constructed during the Plan period will not imply any abandonment of the remaining phases of the basic network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It <Col N="2205" /> is the policy of my Department that flammable goods should be stored in such a way as to minimise the risk of fire.  Flammable liquids are routinely used in hospital laboratories and are best stored in a safe, secure building outside the main hospital building.</P>
      <P>All sources of ionizing radiation used in hospitals are subject to control by licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), which is the competent authority in this area.  The detailed procedures in operation in any particular hospital are a matter for that hospital under the RPII licensing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The general practice is that sealed radioactive sources used by hospitals are returned to the manufacturers. Other radioactive sources used in medical treatment and diagnosis tend to have a short active life.  If necessary, these sources are held in storage until such time as the radioactivity has decayed to a negligible level, at which stage they may be disposed of as non-radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital has had both a flammable goods store and a radioactive waste store on the site since the hospital opened.  In order to improve safety and security the hospital is proposing to build new and improved stores and has applied to Dublin Corporation for planning permission to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned.  I made inquiries from the Mater Hospital and I have been informed that this person has been placed on the urgent waiting list. However, the hospital is unable at this <Col N="2206" /> stage to give a precise admission date for her operation.  If the person feels that her condition has deteriorated she should contact her general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight her case to the consultant.</P>
      <P>In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, I have provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development, which was completed recently, includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme.  These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
      <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>

The Southern Health Board are satisfied that the existing facilities at Kenmare District Hospital are being fully utilised.  The question of the provision of long-stay accommodation in Kenmare will be considered in the context of the board's development plan for community hospitals which is presently being formulated.</P>

      <Col N="2208" /> I might add that short-stay and long-stay nursing care is provided in two registered nursing homes in the Kenmare area to which the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 apply.

      <P>The regulations governing payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance provide for payment of a child dependent allowance in respect of a person under the age of 18 where that person normally resides with and is being wholly or mainly maintained by the disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient.  As a person in receipt of a wage is not being so maintained, he/she would not qualify for a dependent allowance under the existing regulations.</P>
      <P>I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  Some of these are more favourable to disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of disabled people living at home with their parents where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  In contrast, the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, concerned that assessment of spouse's earnings is less favourable under the disabled person's maintenance <Col N="2210" /> allowance scheme.

      <P>An Bord Altranais has statutory responsibility for regulating nurse training in this country.  Under the Nurses Act, 1985, the board is empowered to make rules, subject to my approval, governing training programmes leading to registration. No provision is made in such rules for the religous ethos of training programmes. Individual nurse training schools set their training requirements within the framework of the board's rules.  As employees, student nurses would be expected to perform their clinical role in line with the broad ethos of the employing hospital.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that the higher cost of nursing homes in the Dublin area is a cause of concern to some individuals, particuarly those individuals who have no other income but the non-contributory old age pension and whatever maximum level of subvention is appropriate to their dependency.

      <P>The staffing of a national <Col N="2215" /> school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year. In the case of St. Fintan's national school, there were 390 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus 12 assistants for the 1994-95 school year.  The school also has the service of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.</P>
      <P>The school authorities applied to my Department to appoint a 12th assistant on the basis that its projected enrolment of 434 pupils for September 1994 met the criteria laid down for designation as a developing school.</P>
      <P>My Department sanctioned this additional post on a provisional basis, subject to the condition that a minimum enrolment of 420 be achieved, which was the enrolment required under the criteria for designation as a developing school.  The enrolment in the school in September 1994 was 411, nine pupils short of that laid down in my Department's letter of sanction.</P>
      <P>A strict policy is operated in relation to teaching posts sanctioned on a provisional basis.  Such posts are withdrawn if the conditions specified by my Department are not met.  The post was withdrawn with effect from 1 October 1994.</P>
      <P>In relation to concerns regarding a breach of my Department's maximum class size guidelines, my Department has examinmed the position.  I am happy that it is possible to accommodate the total enrolment in the school within the maxima laid down and the warranted staffing.</P>

    <P>In recent years, as can be seen from the table, there has been a great increase in the numbers taking German.  My Department encourages schools to provide tuition in German, Spanish and <Col N="2220" /> Italian but there are no specific targets set in this respect.</P>
    <P>The position regarding Portuguese is that it is not an approved subject to the leaving certificate examination. However, because of its status as an official EU language, my Department occasionally provides examinations for students who are native speakers of the language.  In these exceptional circumstances, examinations of written work only, at the standard of leaving certificate higher level, are provided.</P>

The grants to be awarded in response to these applications will be made before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>A teacher in a secondary school must be registered to qualify for the payment of incremental salary.  To qualify for registration, an applicant is required to pass an oral Irish competency test.  However, a teacher may be appointed to a post in a secondary school for one year without holding a qualification in Irish.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department that all teachers should be suitably qualified in Irish.  This position has been upheld as reasonable by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.</P>
