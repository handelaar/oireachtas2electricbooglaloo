      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies Owen and Harney.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <P>I seek your permission under Standing Order 30 to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to debate the statements in Dáil Éireann by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, on 23 November 1993, columns 9-12 of the Official Report, which contained inconsistencies and inaccuracies on the information from the EU Commission last November on approval for projects in the national plan, with particular reference to Tallaght Hospital and whether it will be included in the national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hereby request leave under Standing Order 30 to move the Adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the allocation of European Union Structural Funds to Ireland in view of a report today that the Government is to submit to Brussels next week a revised national plan, in <Col N="674" /> light of the persistent indications that the European Union Commission is unhappy with a number of the plan's proposals and the manner in which the Government has pursued these vital negotiations, bearing in mind in particular the remarks of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

In the event of the motion for either or both of the by-elections for Mayo West and Dublin South-Central being moved, the following arrangements shall apply; (i) both motions shall be debated together; (ii) speeches which shall be confined to a spokesperson for the Technical Group, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and the Government, shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) the questions necessary to bring the debate to a conclusion shall be put successively at the end of the debate; 2.

      <P>No, Sir.  The Fine Gael Party believes it does not make sense to proceed with business of a routine nature when it is plain that the Government's national plan is falling apart in the most humiliating circumstances and when Ministers, like spoiled children, are blaming county managers, EC officials, everybody except themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the resignation of Deputy John O'Connell, a member for the Constituency of Dublin South-Central.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago today the Fianna Fáil/Labour Coalition Government introduced its first budget but 24 February 1993 was significant for another event.  Late on budget night the Ceann Comhairle came into the House and, to the surprise of most Members, announced that Deputy John O'Connell was resigning his membership of Dáil Éireann.  When the initial surprise had died down inevitably politicians' attention turned to speculation <Col N="686" /> about a by-election, when it would be held, the candidates and, obviously, who would win.</P>
    <P>Few people would have believed that, 12 months on, Dr. O'Connell's seat would remain unfilled, that there would still be no firm commitment on when the relevant by-election would take place.  Of course, Dublin South-Central does not represent the longest outstanding vacancy.  Almost two months earlier, on 1 January 1993, former Deputy Pádraig Flynn announced his resignation as a Member for Mayo West to take up his post as a member of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I regard the refusal of the Government to hold by-elections for vacancies which remain outstanding for 12 and 14 months respectively as a matter of the utmost gravity which strikes at the heart of our democratic system.  When a Government with the largest majority in the history of the State adopts such a cavalier attitude to the holding of elections, when it considers that constituencies can be left under-represented for such a long period, the alarm bells should start ringing.</P>
    <P>Details of the gap between the occurrence of casual vacancies and the holding of subsequent by-elections are difficult to come by but one would have to go back virtually to the Second World War to find vacancies which had been left unfilled for so long.  I challenge the Minister for the Environment to tell us just how long it has been since we had two simultaneous vacancies in Dáil Éireann for over 12 months, and the circumstances which led to their not being filled for so long.  Is there any other modern democracy in which seats in the National Parliament can be left vacant for so long?  In the case of our nearest neighbour, Britain, by-elections are held regularly, within a matter of weeks, even when they occur in the most politically embarrassing circumstances for the Government.  No justification has been offered by either of the parties in Government for this unprecedented refusal to hold these by-elections. While there have been reports that the by-elections may be held in June, in conjunction with the European Elections, <Col N="687" /> the Government has not been prepared to give a firm commitment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, under existing legislation, there is no requirement that by-elections must be held within a specified period. In theory at least there is nothing to prevent the Government from voting down this attempt to move the relevant writs, from voting down any subsequent attempts, and leaving the relevant seats vacant until the next general election. This is a serious loophole in our electoral legislation which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has a Private Members' Bill on the Order Paper aimed at closing this gap.  Under the provisions of our Bill &mdash; the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1993 &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle would automatically direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue the writ for a by-election 90 days after the vacancy occurred unless the Dáil had passed a motion directing that the writ be issued at an earlier date.  Surely this is a reasonable proposition since the enactment of that Bill, or a similar one, would prevent any Government from abusing its majority in the way it has done in the case of these two vacancies and, in so doing, dodge the people's verdict.</P>
    <P>The principle of equality of representation is clearly enshrined in the Constitution.  The refusal of the Government to hold these by-elections is a breach of the spirit, possibly the letter, of the Constitution.  Article 16.2.2 of the Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.</P>
    <P>Article 16.2.3 of the Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far <Col N="688" /> as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>These figures are distorted as a result of the vacancies in Dublin South-Central and Mayo West.  The people of Dublin South-Central have particular reason to feel aggrieved.  Until the 1992 general election the constituency had five Deputies.  As a result of the recommendations of the constituency review committee the number of seats was reduced to four and now the constituency has been left for more than a year with three Deputies.</P>
    <P>The refusal of Fianna Fáil and Labour to agree to the by-elections being held is in stark contrast to the position adopted by both parties when vacancies arose while they were in Opposition.  There are repeated instances of them demanding that by-elections be held.  When Deputy Ciaran Doherty died on 4 August, 1981 Fianna Fáil moved a writ on 21 October. In 1983, following the death of Deputy George Colley on 17 September, they moved the writ on 2 November and the following year they waited only five weeks before moving the writ following the death of Deputy B. Cowen.</P>
    <P>This Government came to power on the basis of lavish promises of political reform.  Those most generous with their promises were the Labour Party.  This is a Government which agreed a programme &ldquo;to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging openness and participation at all levels, by ensuring public accountability, transparency and trust and the highest standards in public life&rdquo;.  How those fine words contrast with the seedy reality of the Government's record.  Will Deputy Spring tell us how denying the people of Dublin South-Central and Mayo West their full representation in the Dáil is compatible with his promise to ensure the highest standards in public life?  Will the Taoiseach explain how leaving by-elections outstanding for the longest period in 50 years contributes to public accountability, transparency and trust?</P>
    <P>The refusal of the Government to hold the by-elections might be understandable <Col N="689" /> if the outcome was likely to plunge the Government into a minority.  That is not the case.  The Government has the largest majority in the history of the State and even if the Opposition win both by-elections it will not seriously impact on the Government's majority though clearly it will dent its credibility.  The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn is that, despite the size of its majority, the Government fear the wrath of the people and is so lacking in confidence in its record that it is afraid to put it before them.  Irrespective of the size of a Government's majority or its performance in office, there is a right to have vacancies filled within a reasonable time. As the Government parties have failed so spectacularly to live up to their promises there is a particular obligation to allow the people express their views when the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>Those most reluctant to allow the people of Dublin South-Central have their say are the Labour Party.  The party is in serious difficulties in that constituency and local polls show that the impressive vote it received at the last general election has disappeared like yesterday's snow.  On the other hand, Democratic Left has a particular interest in the holding of this by-election.  Eric Byrne, who was an outstanding representative, lost his seat by just four votes after the marathon re-count in the general election. We want to see him back in the Dáil as do many people in Dublin South-Central.</P>
    <P>The Government can run but it cannot hide from the people.  It will have to face the people of these constituencies at some time and when it does the local polls indicate that it will be Fianna Fáil and Democratic Left who will battle it out with Labour relegated to the position of also ran.</P>
    <P>For the past year the Government has been allowed to get away with an outrageous abuse of our democratic system by refusing to hold these by-elections. Last April, Democratic Left moved the writs for the by-elections and the motion was cynically voted down by the Government. It has been allowed off the hook <Col N="690" /> and I find the indifference of the media pundits and commentators, columnists and leader writers to this abuse of democracy astonishing.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to seriously consider the message that is being conveyed to the public by its refusal to hold these elections.  The message is that democracy, politics, membership of the Dáil or the views of the electorate are not important.  There is an alarming degree of cynicism among the public and the Government's attitude will only feed this and do further damage to our democratic system.</P>
    <P>Those of us who value and want to defend the principles of democracy insist on these by-elections being held without further delay.  We urge the Dáil to support the motion by Democratic Left for the by-election to be held in Dublin South-Central.</P>
    <P>I wish to share some of my time with Deputy Gilmore.  The reaction of the public to the budget will be foremost in the minds of Government Deputies when they go through the lobbies on this motion.  No matter how long they put off the proposal for a by-election in Mayo West and Dublin South-Central the people will not forget that the budget resulted in the taxation of unemployment benefit, continues the taxation of disability benefit and, but for the outcry, widows pensions would have been means-tested.  The unemployed and sick now pay more tax than the farming community. If Labour has any regard for the principles it claims to stand for, it would vote for the motion despite the fact that it is unlikely to win the by-election in Dublin South-Central.  It is unacceptable that the House would, for a second time, vote down a motion to give those people their democratic right to full representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons a Government would refuse to hold by-elections: either it has contempt for the people and democracy or it is afraid to face the people.  Given its record and the <Col N="691" /> abandonment of the policies on which it was elected 15 months ago the latter reason is probably the more accurate.</P>
      <P>There is in this Government a smugness, arrogance and bloatedness that is becoming increasingly hard to take.  It has an absolute contempt and dismissiveness for the Opposition and the views of Members, largely brought about by the size of its majority.  It has much of the same kind of contempt for the public and has managed to inflate the offices of its members with additional staff, spin doctors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and pedlars of good news who try to turn even the most menial of announcements into an event of major national importance and sell it to the public.</P>
      <P>Most disturbing of all is the Government's approach to the people.  Two vacancies exist in this House for over a year and the Government has refused to fill them.  That is showing contempt for the people of those constituencies who are entitled to full representation in this House and who are entitled, as a litmus test for the rest of the country, to pass judgment on the Government and on its policies.</P>
      <P>That judgment is necessary because of the extent to which the Government has abandoned many of the policies for which it stood in the election in November 1992 and also because it has abandoned many of the principles set down in the Programme for Government.  This was the Government that would address the unemployment crisis but instead is addressing a tax bill to the unemployed. This was the Government that would address the housing waiting lists but those lists have increased.  This was the Government that would introduce equity in many areas of social policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to concentrate on one area where, even in the past few days, we have seen one of the most craven climb-downs from a stated position by the Government at the time of its formation.  I refer <Col N="692" /> to the position the Government has taken in the area of student grants for higher education.  The people of Dublin South-Central, in particular, are among those urban dwellers who have suffered for many years under a system of student grant administration.  Those PAYE workers who pay the taxes to provide the service are discriminated against in the provision of the service.</P>
    <P>The issue of equity in student grants was put forward by both parties in this Government at the last general election. In one of its typically cynical pre-election promises, the Fianna Fáil Party stated there would be free third level education for everyone from 1994.  That promise did not last long.  In fairness, the Labour Party was more prudent; it promised that student grants would be based on the net income of the applicant rather than on the gross income, as at present.  That promise was withdrawn formally in this House about ten months ago.</P>
    <P>In March 1993 the Minister for Education set up an expert advisory group on the third level student support grant system with the following terms of reference, and I quote from the Official Report of 14 December 1993, column 459:</P>
    <P>(a) to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility of grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants.  In so doing the group would examine the application of the criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means in the existing third level student support schemes; (b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the scheme, including rationalisation of the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with those terms of reference.  The expert group reported to the Government.  It is widely reported that it recommended that the basis on which eligibility for student grants should be based should be radically changed. It made certain recommendations with <Col N="693" /> regard to the administration of the grant scheme.</P>
    <P>On 14 December 1993 the Minister for Education promised in this House that the report would be published when she said:</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to publish the report in February next,</P>
    <P>that is now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>as well as to set out my intentions with regard to its conclusions and recommndations.</P>
    <P>Two day ago we had, through the usual spin-doctored format, an announcement from the Minister for Education that there had been dramatic changes in the way in which the student grant scheme would be administered.  Those changes apply to the second of the two terms of reference which the advisory group was given.  For some reason the report of the group was not published even though that was promised in this House.  There was no announcement as to what the group had recommended in relation to the first term of reference, which dealt with equity, or what the Government proposed to do about it.  It is widely known that the group recommended that the basis on which eligibility is calculated for student grants should be changed. At present it is based on the reckonable taxable income of the parents.</P>
    <P>In the case of a family with three children, the first of whom would be going to college, the reckonable income is £15,500 gross &mdash; an income a postal worker or a local authority worker with little or no overtime would have.  A family with such an income, applying for a student grant may also apply for help with housing or a medical card.  That is a very low income. The result is that the vast majority of PAYE taxpayers in low or middle incomes simply do not qualify for student grants.  There is discrimination against PAYE workers because the self-employed, such as farmers, can deflate their reckonable income in the year in which they apply for the grant.</P>
    <P>A farmer applying for a grant can buy a new tractor in the year in which the <Col N="694" /> child is sitting the leaving certificate and consequentialy the reckonable income is deflated for that year.  The result is that big farmers and business people qualify for student grants whereas people who are often employed by them do not qualify because their income is assessed on the basis of PAYE.  The expert advisory group recommended that this should be changed and that eligibility should be on the basis of assessable assets or wealth. The Government has climbed down on that recommendation and has conceded on the issue of equity.  It is an example of the abandonment, particularly by the Labour Party, of the urban PAYE people who elected them to office.</P>
    <P>People in Crumlin, Drimnagh and throughout the constituency of Dublin South-Central, who are outside the limit for student grants and many other benefits, would have expected that the recommendations of a committee set up by the Government to examine this area would have been implemented.  What we have had in recent days is a climb-down from the Minister for Education, a climb-down from the Government and a further kick in the teeth for PAYE workers.  That is one of the reasons this Government is afraid to face the people.  It is afraid to face them because of its record on issues such as employment, its abandonment of the promise to reverse the so-called dirty dozen which have now been increased to the filthy 15 and its abandonment of those on the local authority housing waiting lists.  Because it has abandoned the people the Government believes the people should not be entitled to express opinions on their performance of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is the second time a motion is before this House to hold by-elections which are due for over a year.  It would be an astonishing travesty of democracy if the Government with the biggest majority in the history of the State was for the second time to deny to the people of those two constituencies their democratic right to elect Members to fill the present vacancies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my <Col N="695" /> time with Deputies Enda Kenny, Barrett and Gay Mitchell who is, unfortunately, absent because he is involved in the select committee dealing with the Extradition Bill.</P>
      <P>That the Government would leave two Dáil vacancies open for a full year shows the complacency of the Government and illustrates that it is putting its own convenience before the principle of the representation of the people.  The Government in all that it does puts its convenience first.  The Government consists of two parties who believe that because of the size of their majority it can take not only the House but the people for granted.  There are many people on the streets of Dublin South-Central and in West Mayo who are only waiting for the opportunity to speak their minds to Government TDs and to pass an unfavourable verdict on the high spending, high tax policies of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is the most centralised in the history of the State and virtually everything that moves in terms of enterprise has to be taxed and/or paid a grant.  Every activity creates dependency on central Government.  It was only in this year's budget that the hidden agenda of this complacent Government became obvious.  With the means-testing of the windows' pensions a vista opened up to show people that the pensions to which they have contributed were no longer secure.  It is clear that the Government has a long term agenda to undermine what were previously guaranteed entitlements. It also intends to extend what it euphemistically describes as the tax base. What it means by extending the tax base is removing allowances that people have had for many years for their mortgages, voluntary health insurance and health expenses and requiring them to pay tax on their houses.  People who entered into commitments to buy their homes, to provide for their health costs through health insurance find that the commitments they entered into are to be undermined because the allowances previously available are to be reduced.  Long-term entitlements to pension is to be undermined <Col N="696" /> and people's long term commitments to provide for themselves are to be taxed.  The Government is promoting dependency on the State rather than independence so that people can provide for themselves and their families.  This is deeply corrosive and it is accompanied by a policy of centralising power.</P>
    <P>The Government has refused to appoint a Minister with responsibility for the west who would take account of the 500 townlands which have been depopulated since the State was founded.  In the next ten years a large number of primary schools in County Mayo will close because there are not enough pupils to make them viable.  We are seeing the gradual disappearance of population in large tracts of country.  The consequence of that is that elderly people will be living alone in townlands and villages without a family member within 100 miles where perhaps the closest member may be living in Athlone or Dublin, if not in New York or Sydney.  These people will not have the traditional support of the extended family in times of tribulation.  That is the human cost of depopulation of the west.</P>
    <P>Similar problems of isolation are occurring in the Dublin South-Central constituency.  It is significant that the detection rate for crimes against women in the Kevin Street Garda district which covers a large part of the Dublin South-Central constituency is one of the lowest in the country and only 11 per cent of crimes against women are prosecuted as a result of detection.  The general detection rate for crime in the Dublin South-Central area is 16 per cent as against a national average of 30 per cent.  People in Dublin South-Central are isolated in their homes.  They are afraid to open their doors and have normal exchanges with other people because of the unattended problem of crime in that area.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of Dublin South-Central the unemployment rates are as high as 70 per cent.  The unemployed people in those areas will not be satisfied with more training schemes and more &ldquo;make work&rdquo; activities provided by the Government. They want jobs based on the production <Col N="697" /> of goods and services because they know that the only truly secure job is based on the production of goods and services for which there is demand.  They are not interested in being involved in &ldquo;make work&rdquo; and they recognise that at the core of the unemployment problem is the tax on the social welfare system being complacently administered by the Government which penalises the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>Any Member who two weeks ago had the opportunity of watching and listening to a series of programmes on unemployment, on RTE radio and television would have noted the deep sense of pessimism about unemployment and would have heard employers admit that there is no prospect of them creating additional jobs in the near future.  They would have noted that the Government is saying that additional costs must be met by manufacturers of furniture, of clothing, of heavy engineering goods and of cement, even though the prices being obtained by producers are falling.  Employers will not create sustainable jobs if Government policies fail to recognise their lack of viability due to falling prices which they are enduring.</P>
    <P>The Government does not see the commercial sector of the economy, other than the multinationals and the large companies which are well represented in IBEC and which can pay large consultancy budgets to ensure they can penetrate the maze of programme managers and advisers surrounding each Minister to insulate them from the feelings of ordinary people.  Small employers and the unemployed cannot get an appointment with programme managers.  It is only those who are well placed, who are well off, who are represented by IBEC and, perhaps, by ICTU who can gain access to Ministers.  Those in small businesses, those who are isolated, never get a chance to meet the policy makers.  It is that sense of isolation, the cocoon which the Government has built around itself, which the by-elections will offer us an opportunity to penetrate.  In the by-election campaigns Ministers who have been able to sit comfortably in their offices <Col N="698" /> contemplating &mdash; in the case of the Labour Party &mdash; two or three more terms in Government with Fianna Fáil, &ldquo;cosying&rdquo; up to Fianna Fáil as Fianna Fáil, fatally for Labour, is &ldquo;cosying&rdquo; up to them, will have their cocoon penetrated. The cocoon will be penetrated if the Ministers are forced to walk the streets of Dublin South-Central and the roads of Mayo and meet the real people who will have much to say to them.  In that spirit it is right that we should support the moving of these writs so that the people can have their opportunity to vote.</P>
    <P>The level of anger about the budget is extreme.  It is essential that the people of Dublin South-Central and Mayo West have the opportunity of passing a verdict on this Government before the Finance Bill is finalised &mdash; in other words within the next three weeks &mdash; so that the Government may learn a lesson from contact with real people.  Having broken out of the cocoon created by the programme managers, the Government will have to learn that it must change some of the mistaken policies it is currently pursuing.</P>

      <P>I support the moving of writs in respect of the by-elections. Traditionally by-elections were held on the death of an existing Member but both these arise from the resignation of Members &mdash; one of whom went to Brussels as Commissioner and the other who, for his own reasons, decided to opt out of the political mainstream.  People in these respective constituencies should have an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government's performance.  It is also an opportunity to pass judgment on the national performance of Government. Somebody once said that the only valid test of leadership is leading vigorously. This came to mind during the past ten days in regard to Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Labour Government has become complacent &mdash; in some ministries extremely arrogant &mdash; and has lost sight of the trust and responsibility placed in it by its seal of office.  Fear generates a situation in which a Government refuses to contest elections but the result is <Col N="699" /> almost inevitable.  I recall distinctly that the Fine Gael led Coalition Government decided to postpone the local elections in 1984 because the timing was not suitable but when they were held in 1985 the party suffered devastating defeats.  I believe this Government will lose both these by-elections.  However, it is undemocratic, politically incorrect, morally wrong and smacks of downright cowardice that the people of Dublin South-Central and the expanses of Mayo West have not been given the opportunity to give their verdict on the performance of this Government.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious to anybody observing the antics of the Government that the Minister of State of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, who was mandated to identify 17 constituencies in which Fianna Fáil could take over, identified them. However, the former Deputy, Mr. Stafford, was nominated to contest the European elections although I understand from Deputy Briscoe's supporters that that was not to be the case.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party has been subsumed into Fianna Fáil.  I notice that the Taoiseach &mdash; rightly &mdash; is at rugby matches, race meetings and other events which previously were the only places where one would find certain members of the Labour Party.  I recall listening in this House to the Taoiseach clarifying the role and the responsibilities of the Office of the Tánaiste a number of months ago. It was proposed practically to have a Tánaiste's Question Time, the Tánaiste was to be the spokesman on Northern Ireland and the Taoiseach would give an occasional supervisory look at this, but what do we find?  He has dominated this area completely.  His aspiration, to which he is entitled, is to have a Fianna Fáil majority, be returned as Taoiseach and see peace in Ireland, all very laudable aspirations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is literally all over the place.  A Probate Tax was introduced but <Col N="700" /> elements of it have since been abolished. The 1 per cent income levy was introduced but following pressure, it was also abolished.  It was proposed to introduce a means test on the widow's pension but it was dropped following a great deal of political pressure.  Residential property tax was introduced but, after great pressure from Fianna Fáil Deputies, anomalies will be addressed by the Minister for Finance.  It will, rightly, go the way of the other nonsensical proposals.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister of State and his Cabinet colleagues that when they cross the bridge at Tarmonbarry and enter the province of Connacht they will certainly receive a warm welcome because the anti-Government forces have been building up for the past 12 months.  In Mayo West, the Fine Gael Party candidate, Councillor Ring, has been canvassing very enthusiastically for the past 12 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is well aware of the two central failures of the Government in Mayo West; (1) it failed to deliver unequivocally, in spite of statements by the Minister for Education and the Taoiseach, third level courses for the students in a Mayo regional technical college; (2) it failed in the provision of phase II of Mayo General Hospital &mdash; where <Col N="701" /> for a very nominal sum medical facilities could be provided for the people of this constituency as well as for the whole county for the next 50 years.  Many Fianna Fáil and Labour Ministers do not comprehend the distances in the west. Mayo West, the constituency I represent, covers Headford to Blacksod, which is over 120 miles and Achill to the borders of east Mayo which is 75 miles, a huge sprawling constituency comprising dwindling villages and small towns in a severely disadvantaged area.  From the increasing numbers turning up at my clinics I know that people resent being deprived of their democratic right of representation.</P>
    <P>The by-election in Mayo West arises as a result of the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, being nominated a Commissioner.  He decided to seize his opportunity and move to Brussels having been thanked by the people of my constituency for his undoubted expenditure in some areas. Last week he was nominated Mayoman of the year and in his acceptance speech, the Commissioner in his inimitable fashion, referring to his beloved people said: &ldquo;I salute you, I celebrate with you and I raise you up on eagles' wings&rdquo;.  Let me assure the members of the Fianna Fáil Party that when they cross into the Barony of Erris, the self same eagles might decide to attack on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I support the moving of this writ.  I look forward to the successful return of two new dedicated enthusiastic ambitious Opposition Deputies to put this Government on the rack and take them out at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was first elected it was a great honour to walk into this Chamber and see so many famous people dedicated to public life.  It was held in great respect like the Government of the day and the main Opposition Party.  All these traditions were very important to me.  The leader of my party &mdash; the main Opposition <Col N="702" /> party &mdash; the leader of Democratic Left and the leader of the Progressive Democrats are present but all the Government can do in its arrogance is send in the nice Chief Whip to sit opposite us with the faithful Deputy Briscoe on the back benches.  No member of the Labour Party or the Cabinet could find the time to come into the House and show the respect the people demand of politicians.</P>
    <P>The Government is displaying arrogance, swanning around as if it owns the place.  Mobile phones are ringing around the House; there are programme managers, spin doctors and assistants.  Every family member is given a job if there is one going.  The leader are the Labour Party, the great socialists, those who say they will fight for the poor.  I cannot see how that party fought for the poor when widows' pensions are to be means-tested.</P>
    <P>The public ask why do we not discuss these matters in the Dáil.  When we try to raise them we are ruled out of order and the Ceann Comhairle says that we should change Standing Orders and that it is a matter for the Whips.  This House is totally irrelevant and every important announcement is made outside it.</P>

      <P>No one is answerable to this House.  We made an arrangement for priority questions at Question Time to allow the Opposition parties to question the Government on matters of national importance but the smart handlers supply Ministers with an eight or nine page reply to the first question to use up the available time so that Ministers cannot be questioned.  Not only is the Government displaying arrogance but it is treating the people of Dublin South-Central and Mayo West and Parliament with contempt. If Parliament is treated with contempt the people represented in Parliament are treated with contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the leaders of the Opposition parties have found the time to contribute to this debate no member of the Cabinet or the Labour Party, either Front Bench <Col N="703" /> or back bench, could sit here for two minutes or even 30 seconds.  The public are waiting for their chance.  We can say what we like about opinion polls but I have been in politics long enough to know what the people are saying on the highways and byways.  I am not saying any particular party in Opposition is doing exceptionally well in the polls but the people are waiting for Government Ministers and Deputies to knock on their doors; they will not get away with what the Government is attempting to do at present.</P>
    <P>I have been appointed by my party leader to direct our by-election campaign in Dublin South-Central.  I am not surprised that the Government does not want to face the people of that constituency because the main issue in the campaign will be unemployment.  When Fianna Fáil took office in 1987 fewer than 200,000 people were unemployed, a figure no one could have been proud of. Various promises were made.  However, in the space of seven years &mdash; whether Fianna Fáil likes it or not it must take the blame for this &mdash; another 100,000 people have been added to the unemployment list.  There is no point in indicating what the position was during the term of office of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition because the fact remains that 100,000 people have been added to the unemployment list in seven years.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Ahern became Minister for Finance the national debt has increased by £1 billion a year.  I do not see any columnists writing about this but such facts cannot be ignored.  In addition the national plan is a sham.  It is now collapsing despite the fact that it was launched with a fanfare in Dublin Castle and every spin doctor tried to convince every group that the Taoiseach would secure £8 billion for the people.  We soon realised that the figures were out by approximately £1 billion.  A European Commissioner called the Tánaiste a liar on television.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, is also displaying incompetence. We have been told that the allocation <Col N="704" /> for the road network under the National Development Plan is to be reduced by £200 million.  The Minister's only defence for his part in this debacle is to blame county councillors and county managers and accuse them of not filling in the potholes properly.  According to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this is one of the reasons we are in danger of losing this massive sum of money.  Who is codding who?  The Minister also had the arrogance to say that councillors ran away from their responsibilities by not having the guts to impose local charges. What has that to do with the National Development Plan?  Can anyone imagine someone being fooled into writing this rubbish?</P>
    <P>Those living in places such as Templeogue are waiting for their chance to have a say on the residential property tax and service charges which the Minister instructed councillors to impose.  Lest the Government thought matters were going to improve it hammered VHI relief and mortgage interest relief.  The National Development Plan has fallen out of the famous bag holding the money.</P>
    <P>We were promised that during the period of the last plan, between 1989 and 1993, 175,000 jobs would be created.  Although 80,000 jobs were created 70,000 people lost theirs.  The crunch is that 93,000 people emigrated during that period.  My message to the Minister for the Environment is that he should not blame county managers and county councillors for his incompetence and that of his colleagues in Government but rather blame the Government for the fact that European Unions officials are coming to examine the plans.</P>
    <P>If the Government says it will solve the unemployment problem by creating 175,000 jobs and ends up with a net gain of ten, the loss of 93,000 people and unemployment increased to 300,000, it is no wonder the people in Europe who hand out money are asking what this incompetent Government is doing with it.  If I were handing out money I would ask the same.  The Minister should look into his own heart and soul before looking <Col N="705" /> into the hearts and souls of councillors, county managers and county engineers and blaming them for the loss of, perhaps, £200 million in the road plan alone, never mind the promised 15 per cent in the overall plan that we have been warned about.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats support the motion in Deputy De Rossa's name.  I agree with many of the comments made earlier by Deputies De Rossa, Bruton, Kenny and Barrett.  It is important to hold these elections because the seats have been vacant for 14 months in one case and, in the other for just over 12 months.  The Government has a large majority, two of the Fianna Fáil Deputies do not have the Fianna Fáil Whip but in all the votes in this House since the Whip was removed from them they have voted with the Government.  The Government, therefore, has a majority of 35 which is bad for democracy and the country &mdash; I will deal with that later.  It would not be sensible for the electorate in Dublin South-Central or Mayo West to return any other Deputy for either of the Government parties.  I agree with my colleagues on the Opposition benches that the Deputies elected should represent Opposition parties.  After that we might disagree as to which Opposition party the Deputies should represent.  The important thing is that they should represent the Opposition and I intend to deal at some length with my reasons for believing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that again we have no Member of the Labour Party in the House.  They came in to form a quorum but within a minute had left.  It is an indication of the attitude of the Labour Party in Government to this House.  Last <Col N="706" /> night I read the Programme for Government, I advise Deputies on all sides of the House to read it because it makes entertaining reading.  Fred Astaire once said that in politics you can make a few mistakes on the way up, but if you make enough mistakes at the top people will think it is your style.  This Government is making so many mistakes it has become its style.</P>
    <P>Page 58 of the Programme for Government is relevant to what we are discussing.</P>
    <P>We know that we cannot achieve our objective on our own.  That is why we are seeking to establish the widest possible consensus and participation in decision making at national and local level so that the energies and ideas in every part of our community are harnessed in trying to achieve tangible progress for all our people.  The hallmark of our Government will be openness and accountability and we will reform and modernise our institutions and laws.  We will foster a flourishing culture and a healthy environment.  In all that we do we will try to bring out and reflect our national character and spirit at its best.</P>
    <P>The Government has dampened the spirit of the people, instead of trying to create an enterprising culture and spirit the Government puts down, at the first opportunity, anybody who is enterprising. The property tax was mentioned earlier and some Government Deputies misrepresent what it is about.  The concern is not just about the amount of money individual families will pay but about what it represents.  I saw it described as a begrudger's tax and that is what it is.  Those who try to help themselves are put down at every opportunity by the policies of the Government.  The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, said in his book that he and his daughter-in-law devised the residential property tax.  That did not matter when she was just the daughter-in-law of the former Taoiseach but she is now a Minister of State &mdash; to use her own words, she is the Minister for the £8 billion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> Everything she turns her hand to is a disaster and most Government back-benchers know that.</P>
    <P>Yesterday afternoon the Minister of State said that the row over Tallaght Hospital was a storm in a tea cup, it is not and the Government's plan for the Structural Funds is in deep trouble. Respected senior European Community officials were rounded upon in an unfortunate fashion by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who should know better.  The intemperate nature of his remarks referring to the officials as merely civil servants was most unfortunate. These are honourable people doing their job.  They are paid by the European taxpayers and it is their job to scrutinise the plans for the allocation of Structural Funds.  They are drawing attention to major deficiencies in the Government plan and to the Government's own inadequacy.</P>
    <P>The Structural Funds started off at £8 million which attracted the Labour Party because, if there is anything the Labour Party loves, it is spending taxpayers' or European money, anybody's money but its own.  Last July the Tánaiste told us we would receive £7.8 billion in Structural Funding and in October it became £7.2 billion.  He told us in this House the plan was so good that we would get the full range of what he called the &ldquo;forchette&rdquo;, that we would get the top of the range, the range being £7.2 to £7.8 billion.  We now know that the true figure is nearer to £6 billion and I understand the Government is being forced to submit revised plans for a meeting on 3 March next.  Rather than openness, accountability and transparency, which the Government claims is its hallmark, it has refused to answer questions on the issue. It refuses to have statements in this House on the issue, even though it will be discussed at senior European level on 3 March next.  The manner in which the Government handled that matter is a disgrace. When the people of Dublin South-Central, Mayo West and those voting in the European elections are called on to pass judgment on this Government after <Col N="708" /> one year in office, I have no doubt about the verdict.</P>
    <P>There have been 108 by-elections since 1923 and 50 per cent of them were lost by the party who previously held the seat. Unfortunately, the majority of those by-elections were necessary because of the death of a Member of this House, but on this occasion they are necessary because of the resignation of two Fianna Fáil Members.  Fianna Fáil does not deserve to hold those seats.  Its record in Government with the Labour Party does not warrant support from the electorate in either of those constituencies.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in Government has an influence far beyond its size.  Every time I meet a Labour Party Minister, whether at junior or senior level, he or she is anxious to tell me about the marvellous relationship and how well both parties are getting on together.  A vote for Fianna Fáil is a vote for Labour and a vote for Labour is a vote for Fianna Fáil &mdash; there is no difference whatever.  Members of the Labour Party are so content they do not want anybody to raise objections. They do not want this House to meet; if the House never met it would suit them better.  They do not want to answer questions. The real debates on the important political issues are not held in this House, but on radio and television programmes and in newspaper articles.  We have received more information from Tommy Gorman, Seán Flynn, Catherine Butler and others about issues such as the Structural Funds than from any Member of the Government.  The manner in which this House is being by-passed in regard to effective debate on the issues of the day is tragic.</P>
    <P>The Structural Funds debacle is only part of the overall approach of this Government.  I will not bother to give the full details of what the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is supposed to do except to say that he claimed every citizen would be treated equally and the number of laws passed would be unique. His first task was to look after the travellers, but what did he do?  He tried to find a Deputy from the Opposition benches to chair a task force and Deputy <Col N="709" /> McManus, a very able and courageous Deputy, agreed to take it on.  Could he not get anybody in the Labour Party to take the job?  If so, would he have offered it to members of the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left and, perhaps, to Fine Gael?  The first time he had an opportunity to do something for a marginalised group in our society &mdash; a Minister with a portfolio at last &mdash; he ran away from his responsibility, handed it over to a task force and put a Deputy from an Opposition party in charge of the task force.  If there are any political problems the Labour Party will not be blamed. When there is a problem, the Democratic Left will hold responsibility, but when a solution is found the Minister will take the credit.  I know the style of this Minister.</P>
    <P>He also ran away from the problem of the Matrimonial Home Bill, which could have been amended.  He decided to forget about it.  The divorce referendum will be a disaster and a worse nightmare than that of 1986.  At least on that occasion the Taoiseach and the Cabinet, by and large, were committed to holding a divorce referendum.  On this occasion the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and one or two others are committed to holding a referendum, but the full Cabinet is not committed.  I will give it my full support, the issue is much too serious to play politics with.  Marital breakdown is a tragedy and the victims deserve to be dealt with realistically and compassionately by our laws and Constitution. I am committed to the concept of providing divorce for those whose marriages have broken down and who want a second chance.  The Opposition will probably be expected to carry the can for that referendum.  No doubt the Government will walk away from its responsibility. It is disgraceful that it walked away from its responsibility in respect of the Matrimonial Home Bill.  The Supreme Court did not throw out the whole principle. It stated that couples should not be forced to make particular arrangements. It did not say that the principle of joint ownership of the family home was wrong. The Government should re-examine the <Col N="710" /> matter because it is fundamental, particularly to the female spouse in a marriage partnership.  Women who work in the home should be entitled, as a right, to joint ownership of the family home.</P>
    <P>We sought to hold a debate on the role of the Presidency.  When the President was asked to Chair an important UN working group, which would have been a great honour for us as a small nation, she was first told it would be unconstitutional for her to do so.  When she received her own advice that it was not unconstitutional, she was told it could involve a policy conflict, even though we do not have a policy on the UN, as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs established during a number of meetings with officials.  If we do not have an official policy in that regard, with what policy could the President be in conflict?  This is part of the Government's begrudgery &mdash; if it cannot do it, she cannot.  Rather than face the music and answer the questions, the Tánaiste told us the President's role would be expanded.  When asked if his views were representative of those of the Government as a whole, he said they were and that he had no reason to believe otherwise.  However, the Taoiseach told us yesterday that the Government does not have any plans to expand the President's role.  When a problem arose the Tánaiste created a smoke screen and when attention is diverted, it is forgotten about.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business on Tuesday, 15 February I asked the Taoiseach if the Government intended moving the writs for the two by-elections and he said, &ldquo;if not in this term, certainly next term&rdquo;. When I asked him if he intended holding the elections on 9 June he said that was not decided yet but it was a possibility.  If the Government can get away with it, it will not hold the by-elections on 9 June. Fortunately, we are forced to hold the European elections at this time; if not, we probably would not hold those elections either.  MEPs would probably be chosen by the Minister for the Environment, similar to the representatives on the committee of the regions, of which eight of the nine members represent the two <Col N="711" /> Government parties and one represents the Fine Gael Party, the chairperson of the General Council of County Councils. The manner in which the Government treats this House, the people it represents and its total abandonment of democracy is a disgrace.  A measure of any majority is the way it treats minorities.  Judged by that criterion, this Government's behaviour, its treatment of this House, the minority parties in it and the people at large, is a disgrace.  When an opportunity arises the people will know that it makes no sense to elect another member of Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party; the two are one as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government referred in its Programme for Government to freedom of information, the broadening of democracy and ethics in Government.  Those words sound fine but when tested they mean nothing.  When the Tánaiste ran into difficulties in allocating the Structural Funds he called on civil servants to rescue him and said that if people did not believe him they could ask Ambassador X or Ambassador Y.  They could not speak for themselves but they were used to back up the Tánaiste's approach.  On this occasion the European officials were again called in but not for support, rather to take the blame.  We were told the officials were wrong.  As Deputy Barrett said, we are told that if money is not allocated for secondary roads it is not the fault of the Minister or the Government but of the county managers or the county councils.  Everybody else is at fault except those who are elected and should be accountable, but are refusing to accept that.</P>
    <P>It is important that people in Dublin South-Central and Mayo West, two different types of constituencies, be given an opportunity at the earliest possible date to pass judgment on this high spending, high tax Government.  It is a Government which seeks to drown the spirit of the people at every opportunity through higher taxes and higher spending.  Public sector pay will increase by 6.1 per cent this year and it is estimated that inflation will be 2.5 per cent.  Government spending <Col N="712" /> this year compared to last year has increased by 17 per cent.  The rate of inflation was approximately 1.5 per cent last year and it is estimated it will be 2.5 per cent this year which amounts to an inflation rate of 4 per cent over the two years and we have a spending level of 17 per cent.  Government spending is four times higher than the rate of inflation. The philosophy of the Labour Party is to keep spending, to borrow money or raise it through taxes.  That party wants to spend money and to be involved in handing it out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Fitzgerald, described herself as the Minister for £8 billion although I have not heard her describe herself as the Minister for £6 billion or the Minister for £7 billion. As a former junior Minister I know how such office holders can be landed with unpleasant tasks.  However, Deputy Fitzgerald should explain what is happening in relation to the Structural Funds.  She should seek to live by the noble words contained in the Programme for Government but she might as well put it through the shredder.  After a little more than one year in office the chapters in that programme make entertaining reading.</P>
    <P>I wish to share some time with Deputy McManus.</P>
    <P>The Mayo West and Dublin South-Central constituencies are different types of constituencies.  Dublin South-Central is an urban constituency and part of it has a high level of unemployment.  Some constituents will be affected by the property tax and those who try hard to help themselves are concerned about what that tax represents.  The Tánaiste described the Structural Funds moneys as a fourchette &mdash; a range of funds from £7.2 billion to £7.8 billion.  That fourchette is already leaking millions by the day.  When the voters of Dublin South-Central get an opportunity to vote for the Tánaiste fourchette in the form of the Tanaiste's candidate, I have no doubt as to what the result will be.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Taoiseach, commenting on the bishops report, &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo;, said he was committed to the <Col N="713" /> development of the west.  He said he did not intend to appoint a Minister for the west because the issues there cut across several Departments and I agree with him in that regard.  The issue is not just about appointing a Minister for the west but that the Taoiseach will not allow the west have its due quota of Deputies.  The Mayo West constituency has been without a Deputy since the formation of this Dáil.  The quota of Deputies for the Mayo West constituency has not been filled since the Government came into office a little more than a year ago.  The way the voters of that constituency have been treated is a disgrace.  The issue is not about the internal differences of finding out who the candidates will be, it is about whether all electors should be treated equally as proved under the Constitution. Is there to be an equality of Deputies as between all constituencies or are some constituencies, because of matters that might be expedient at a time, to be treated on a different basis?  The Government are not prepared to face up to the task of allowing the people to pass judgement on it because it knows what the result of the by-elections will be in both constituencies.</P>
    <P>In April 1993 this issue was raised by Deputy De Rossa and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, was given the task of responding to the questions.  I support what has been said about there being no senior member of the Government or a member of the Labour Party present for this debate.  That speaks volumes about their attitude to the people they were elected to represent, to democracy, the broadening of democracy, ethics in Government and a host of other matters.  The Minister of State said in April last that the Government had only taken up office, it needed time to put its plans in place and did not want to be distracted by by-elections that are timeconsuming. He said that the business of the House was such that if we had by-elections, the Opposition &mdash; about which he was particularly concerned &mdash; because of its small numbers would not be able to service the committees, participate in <Col N="714" /> debate in the House and canvass.  I envy a Minister of State who has such concern for the Opposition.  The Minister of State does not give a damn whether the Opposition can service the House or the committees. He was battling to put a good face on a bad decision by the Government and, no doubt, he will do the same this morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, when responding, should indicate if the Government has finally decided to hold the by-elections on 9 June.  If the intention is to vote down this motion, when will the writs for those by-elections be moved and when will the Government make a decision on this matter?  The Taoiseach said last week that the holding of the by-elections on 9 June was only a possibility?  That is not good enough.  It is the duty of Government to provide the opportunity for the consensus referred to in the Programme for Government, and to ensure that people are allowed have representation, regardless of what type of representation that might be.</P>
    <P>Voting for these motions this morning will obviously result in the by-election being held in March and not on 9 June. That might not make a great deal of sense if elections will take place on 9 June.  I will vote for the motions because I strongly believe in the principle involved.  Democratic Left are right to come back ten months after they last put a motion to the House and ask what is the delay now and why have the by-elections not been held. An impression was given last April that the by-election would have been held in the autumn of last year.  Most Deputies understood that to be the Government's intention.  The way the Government has treated the voters of those constituencies is not good enough.  The appropriate time to hold these by-elections is 21 to 30 days after the passing of these motions.  That would mean they would be held on a different date to the European elections and would allow the voters in those constituencies, which are different types of constituencies but typical of the majority of voters as they include a mix of rural and urban voters, to pass judgment on the Government's credibility.  When that <Col N="715" /> is put to the people it will be resoundingly shown that the Government does not have credibility among the electorate.  Its mismanagement of high spending and high tax policies and its mishandling of so many issues of vital interest to this country will lead the voters to refuse to endorse the Government's approach or give it two Deputies to continue its approach and policies.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Harney for sharing her time with me.  We like to think we live in a democracy, but what we are living in is an Orwellian type democracy; all animals are equal but some are more equal than others.  The voting population of Dublin South-Central and Mayo West are less equal than electors in other constituencies.  That is not their choice but is due to pure political connivance by the Government. Our neighbouring island had a history of rotten boroughs which had a small electorate and were in the gift of certain noble families.  Loath as I am to call Dublin South-Central or Mayo West rotten boroughs, the Government is treating them as if they were constituencies in their own gift.  In Britain, the great Reform Act did away with rotten boroughs but, unfortunately, that has not happened in Ireland.  Those quaint remnants of a reactionary British system are what Fianna Fáil are now upholding in the way by-elections and general elections are determined by parties in power, regardless of the rights or desires of the people.  That undermines political credibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard much talk since I was elected to this House of how concerned Deputies are about the lack of credibility in politicians.  Government manoeuvring in terms of the by-elections is part of the reason people have lost faith in politics and politicians.  If it does not really matter whether a by-election is held, why fill the seat?  If it does not matter that only three seats in a four seater constituency are filled, why have four seats?  Why not reduce the number to two or even one? We should remember that a significant <Col N="716" /> number of people in these constituencies did not vote for the TDs who now represent them.  Do those people not have a right to representation, or is it simply, which is clearly the case, that the Government is running scared?  The Government is afraid to meet people and answer questions they will legitimately ask, that is why the by-elections are being put on the long finger.  It is certainly not due to fear of the Government falling because it has a vast majority.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Government is usually shamed into holding by-elections &mdash; at present it takes a lot to shame a British Tory politician.  By-elections are held and they take their medicine, but here it is impossible to shame the Government. It has adopted all the worst features of shoddy politics.  It is all about political advantage, not about democracy.  If this trend continues, eventually a precedent will be set to eliminate by-elections. What will that do to democracy?</P>
    <P>I checked the dictionary for the definition of &ldquo;democrat&rdquo;, I wanted to see if the Taoiseach is a democrat.  The dictionary states that &ldquo;democrat&rdquo; is an advocate for democracy.  I discovered &mdash; this is probably not well known &mdash; that &ldquo;democrat&rdquo; is also a four-wheeled cart with several seats, one behind the other.  The problem is that one seat is missing from the democratic cart in two of our constituencies.</P>
    <P>We need only look across the Border to see what happens when people feel disenfranchised.  The distortion of gerrymandering is deeply buried in the Northern Nationalist psyche and it will probably take generations to die, regardless of the solutions proposed.  This affects our fellow countrymen and women and should not be disregarded. We should learn from that lesson.  People have a right to elect their representatives, those who, whether in Government or Opposition, will make laws by which they will subsequently have to abide.  To mess about with that right is to play with fire.</P>
    <P>Séamus Deane referred to unemployment in our bones, ending up with stones in people's hands.  I do not think we have got to that stage, but if people are disenfranchised, if the fundamental <Col N="717" /> principles of democracy are disregarded, it will result in a lot of anger.  We should remember that the population who elect us are our masters and should not be manipulated, as the Government is doing.  They have an inalienable right to determine who will represent them and no Government should deny it.</P>

      <P>In regard to the comments made about the way in which the people of Dublin South-Central have been disenfranchised, the three Deputies for this area represent approximately 26,750 people.  Under the Constitution, there should be one Deputy for every 20,000 people with some leeway given for one Deputy for every 30,000 people. As Shakespeare said, &ldquo;there is nothing either right or wrong but thinking makes it so&rdquo;.  If Fianna Fáil was in Opposition it would be making exactly the same case as the Deputies opposite are making.  I assure Deputy Harney that the problems of law and order and unemployment in Dublin South-Central were as bad when the Progressive Democrats were in Government with Fianna Fáil a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of the Opposition is to knock the Government as hard as it can, and it has no better opportunity to do this than during a by-election.  This is only natural, it always happens.  We all know that by-elections are notorious for going against the Government of the day.  However, as <Col N="720" /> Deputy Harney correctly said, the outcome of these by-elections will not change the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Deputy Byrne of Democratic Left got 7 per cent of the votes in Dublin South-Central in the last general election, a drop of 8 per cent.  If one takes The Workers' Party and Democratic Left together, the share of the vote amounted to 9.21 per cent.  There is no question of the people of Dublin South-Central being disenfranchised.  One of the reasons the Democratic Left vote fell so sharply was that it made promises which people knew <Col N="721" /> it would not keep.  One can only do this for so long before people cop on.  Fianna Fáil, which had only 29.6 per cent of the votes, held two seats in that constituency &mdash; supporters of other parties who want good representation, and please God will continue to, also voted for the Fianna Fáil candidates.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil will win the by-election in Dublin South-Central. We will do our best to explain our policies to the electorate, who will know that the Opposition parties are merely carrying on.  Will Members of the Opposition be canvassing?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny is a gentleman and a fine constituency colleague, but I am not sure he would look as comfortable as he did this morning if his prediction that Fine Gael, through Councillor Michael Ring, would win that seat was proved correct.  Deputy Kenny has had a long reign in Mayo West but I predict that the Government will win the by-election and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous. I do not have to refer to the opinion polls where the Opposition parties are languishing.  The people of Mayo have ample confidence in the Government which has been in control of economic policy for the past 14 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention briefly what has been happening in Mayo West during those 14 months, despite the fact that our representation has been halved. The former Minister, Mr. Flynn, did much for the constituency and had ample opportunity as Minister for the Environment. Development has not stopped in Mayo West.  There is a record level of Government investment in the constituency in 1993-94.  In the past week alone three measures have been implemented which will be beneficial.</P>
      <P>For 20 years we sought development of Darby's Point, on the island of Achill. Unfortunately, Achill is an area which has suffered a huge loss in population in the past five years.  For 20 years the locals campaigned for the development of a port in the area and an allocation of £300,000 from Structural Funds was made to add a 25-metre extension to the pier.  This is a welcome measure after a 20-year campaign because it is the major fishery port situated between Killybegs and Rossaveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past week, within a few days of receiving the report &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo;, which was prepared at the behest of the west of Ireland bishops, the <Col N="724" /> Taoiseach announced that he was setting up a task force which has been given a mandate to report within two months.  I am satisfied that serious consideration will be given to all the 140 recommendations in that report.</P>
    <P>A new programme for local development has been announced by the Taoiseach's Department.  Under the old programme there was an area of North Mayo known as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area.  We now have a new area called Mayo Central which covers almost the entire remainder of the county.  This programme, working along with the IRDs and the Leader companies, is a welcome development and we look forward to its implementation at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds are being spent on water, sewerage and road improvements in our country.  There have been record levels of investments and a record number of schemes are under consideration in the Department of the Environment.  I have no doubt that the planning of those schemes is progressing, irrespective of the fact that we are minus one Deputy.  Confidence is so great in Fianna Fáil that we have five or six candidates offering to contest the Mayo West by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to be humiliated to the extent suggested by the Opposition, why would five or six capable, experienced councillors wish to put themselves forward?  The people in West Mayo have confidence in the work of the Government, despite suggestions of the Opposition at county council level that the west has been forgotten because the opportunity has not been availed of to appoint a Minister for western development. The people of West Mayo are the best barometer in this regard.  There has been a high level of investment by people in the area, and by organisations and communities right along the western seaboard. This includes community fundraising activities, developing additional sporting and social facilities, investment <Col N="725" /> in golf clubs and record levels of house building by private contractors.  This is in addition to the programme that has just been announced for a record number of new houses.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the budget and while some people in West Mayo are subject to the residential property tax, it is not a major issue.  The concerns of my constituents are the matters which have been dealt with directly in the budget.  The budget has been widely applauded and I have no doubt that the confidence to which I have referred will be further enhanced by its measures.</P>

      <P>Lest there be any concern on the part of the members of the Opposition, I assure them that the Government will be opposing these motions when the time comes to vote on them.  They will be delighted with that reassurance because I noticed when the political correspondents yesterday suggested that the Government would accept the motion, there was a degree of panic among the Opposition parties at the prospect of a by-election between now and Easter.  Rather than keeping them in suspense, I want to make it clear that we will be opposing the motion.</P>

      <P>There has been much talk about democracy from the Opposition benches this morning and reference to the so-called arrogance of the Government. It has been said also that the Government is afraid to face the electorate. I wish to deal with those issues in addition to some other hypocritical statements that were made by a number of Deputies.  I realise I have only 15 minutes to reply but I will try to respond to much of the rhetoric I have heard in the past hour and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a safe and substantial majority in the House.  I suppose it could be arrogant if it so wished.  It could ram legislation through the House. It could disregard the wishes of the Opposition <Col N="726" /> and ignore their requests for debates, changes to legislation and so on. That is a possibility with the size of the majority that the Government has at present but any fair minded person observing events in this House during the past 14 months since this Government came to power would say that exactly the opposite has happened.  The Government has facilitated the Opposition at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Government business is set in conjunction with the Opposition Whips.  In the past 14 months the guillotine has rarely had to be used in this House.  Any reasonable request by the Opposition for additional time to debate Bills or to make statements has been reasonably met and I defy any fair minded person to say otherwise.  Due to the reforms that have been introduced we now have a system whereby the Opposition have more say than ever before in the business of the House and in legislation.  Members of the Opposition have commented favourably during the past 14 months on the committee system and comments have been made in the public media also about the willingness of Government Ministers to accept amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government is taking credit for that.  I do not mind also giving credit to the Opposition for its very constructive participation in the various committees, which is as it should be.  As implied by Members earlier there is no danger to democracy.  Every fair minded person will accept that the position over the past 14 months has been the opposite when everybody got a fair crack of the whip in relation to business in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a number of points raised on the <i>National Development Plan 1994-97</i> on the Order of Business in recent mornings.  The plan provided for approximately £8 billion worth of projects and is at present being discussed by the Government and the European Commission.  The negotiations are under way and it is hoped to settle a Community Support Framework for an agreed allocation. There will be a mid-term review <Col N="727" /> of that allocation in 1996.  Within that context the Government will make whatever adjustments are necessary in the national plan figures but, in doing so, will include all the projects contained in the original plan.  This is the same procedure followed in the case of the 1989-1993 plan when the Community Support Framework provided for £3.7 billion worth of projects.  The framework, the equivalent of what we are now discussing, was for £2.86 billion but the eventual draw-down by this country was £3.4 billion.</P>

      <P>I am delighted she took time to read the Programme for Government. Perhaps if she and Deputy Gilmore read it in greater depth, with our policy document issued prior to the last general election, they might have a better idea of what the Government is doing.  If Deputy Harney looks at the cover of the Programme for Government she will see that it is not due for completion until 1996. Anybody who expects the entire programme to be put in place in one year <Col N="728" /> is living in cloud cuckoo land but the Government will not join them there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney referred briefly to the residential property tax and her party's position on it.  In a recent programme on RTE she said that her party never supported property tax but the record is different.  For example, Deputy O'Malley, when Leader of the Progressive Democracts supported property tax without qualification.  On 11 July 1988 he said in the House that his party was committed to a comprehensive property tax, which was confirmed at the Progressive Democrats Party Conference later in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Barrett is paying attention.  We listened this morning to Deputy John Bruton speak about high spend and high tax Governments.  The Fine Gael policy in relation to PRSI was to remove the ceiling altogether, which was also the Progressive Democrats' policy.  Deputy Harney alleged, repeated by Deputy John Bruton, that this was a high tax, high spend Government.  Is Deputy Harney objecting to Tallaght Hospital being built?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think she will object.  We will get the money where we get a lot of the rest of it.</P>
      <P>The second allegation levelled at the Government was that it was afraid to face the electorate and that was why the by-elections were postponed.  I do not know where Members of the Opposition get the impression the Government is afraid to face the public.  Over the past 12 months &mdash; as I said when this matter was last debated in the House &mdash; the new Government wanted to get on with the very serious business on hand as it had a lot of legislation to process.  The record over the past 12 months will show that we did so.  Within that period over 50 Bills were processed by the House, demonstrating that the Government is working in that respect, but not in that respect only.  In referring to Northern Ireland Deputy John Bruton, in his contribution to the debate last time round predicted &mdash; Official Report 28 April 1993, column 1,626:</P>
      <P>I hope this combination of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party has the capacity to make a contribution towards solving that problem. However, I have the gravest doubts about this because they seem to be paralysed by indecision when it comes to making any major move by way of a generous response from people on this side of the Border in order to break the logjam in the talks process.  It seems that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are unable to make up their minds as to who is ultimately responsible for Northern Ireland policy.  They have effectively paralysed each other in regard to making any generous gesture and indicating a willingness to change Article 2 and 3 of the Constitution, if there is a settlement, to get the talks moving.  As long as we have this coalition of paralysis in office we are not going to see movement or the urgency that should be shown on this side of the Border about the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote that just to show how far out <Col N="730" /> Deputy John Bruton can be in his predictions. His predictions in relation to job targets, the economy and so on this morning will be as far out in 12 months as they were 12 months ago.</P>

We have delivered consistently on our Programme for Government over that period and have made major progress in a variety of areas, not least Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for allowing me to share my time with Deputy Currie and I congratulate him on taking up this brief which will clearly need to be handled with great sensitivity in the run up to a referendum on divorce. My party has absolute confidence in the way Deputie Currie will handle this issue on our behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for <Col N="737" /> his good wishes and his confidence.  It was an early confirmation of the challenge of this portfolio that within five hours of my being appointed the Minister introduced the Second Stage of this Bill.  I was thrown in at the deep end and I am glad of the assistance which has been given to me by Deputy Richard Bruton.  In his speech the Minister said that in terms of its size and scope this Bill is one of the biggest and most extensive pieces of family law measures to come before the House.</P>
      <P>I have been thrown in at the deep end but, of course, that is not the first time and probably not the last.  It is also my luck that my first speech as party spokesperson should be on law reform rather than equality, of which I have some experience during my long career.</P>
      <P>I hope this is a matter on which we will co-operate in the interests of the community generally but particularly those sections where there is inequality and people believe themselves to be marginalised and impotent.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Shatter, because this Bill owes much to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act, 1989, which he introduced.  I think Members on all sides appreciate what we owe to Deputy Shatter.  I look forward to having his assistance in the future.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the size of the Bill, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Turning now to specific provisions of the Bill, Deputies will appreciate that in view of its size it would not be practicable for me to go through all of the Bill in detail at this stage.</P>
      <P>I too will concentrate on a number of specific points.  During the RTE news this morning they referred to this Bill as a blueprint for the Government's divorce proposals.  The Minister put the introduction of this Bill in context when he said:</P>
      <P>Because the Bill contains, in effect, model provisions for any future divorce legislation the Bill's importance stretches far beyond the framework in which it is currently set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> I do not see it entirely in this light because certain proposals in the Bill stand in their own right, for example, the provisions in relation to the minimum age of marriage at 18 years; three months of preparation before the actual marriage and the provisions in general terms on pensions. These stand on their own apart from the larger agenda the Minister might have.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the recent Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill where the central principle, the establishment of joint ownership of the matrimonial home as the norm within marriage, was struck down.  Whoever was at fault, whether the Minister, the Government or the Attorney General it was, by common consent, a mess, particularly when it was being portrayed as a stepping-stone to the divorce referendum.  Can the Minister assure this House that this Bill, if passed, will not suffer a similar fate?  I ask that question not only in the light of the Matrimonial Home Bill but also because this Bill is based very largely on the 1989 Act which I understand will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  In those circumstances it is only fair to clarify this issue.  Debate on legislation is never a waster of time unless at a later stage the Bill is found to be unconstitutional.  I assume the Minister is satisfied that this Bill is constitutional but I wish him to elaborate on the reasons.  This would be of interest not only to me but to others in the House.  We would also like to know the procedure that has been gone through to establish the constitutionality of the Bill, in the Department, in the Government and in the Attorney General's Office.</P>
    <P>It is important to have this matter clarified because at its mildest there has been a number of mistakes in the advice offered to the Government in recent times.  We would be in a better position to proceed with the Bill if we knew as much as possible about the advice on the constitutionality of the Bill.  Has the Minister been advised on the constitutionality of a three month notification period?  Can he assure us that this and other aspects of the Bill are <Col N="739" /> constitutional?  It might be helpful if the Minister would consider advising the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.  I say that in the light of the constitutional issues that have arisen with the former Bill.  We are heading into a referendum on divorce and at all stages the question of constitutionality is likely to be raised.</P>
    <P>I support strongly raising the marriage age to 18 years.  It was ludicrous that it was lower in the past.  We used to restrict the voting age to 21 and it was subsequently lowered to 18 years.  A decision as to how to cast one's vote hardly weighs in the same category as the decision to enter into a marriage contract, the biggest decision in most people's lives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the age of marriage is to be raised to 18 years.  I welcome also that three months notification of marriage is required.  This is a sensible proposal and is in line with the procedure in some of the churches.  It is very good to put it on a statutory basis.  Section 32 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Registrar shall notify each of the persons concerned in writing of the receipt by him or her of a notification under subsection (1) and, upon receipt by him or her of such a notification he or she, shall make it available at his or her office or place of business for inspection by members of the public during ordinary office hours in the month following its receipt.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, for two reasons, about this provision.  Last year my eldest daughter got married.  Although it was a happy occasion I would not like it to happen every year.  After making inquiries at a number of hotels about wedding receptions the post increased significantly. Offers were received from florists, car hire companies, caterers and so on.  If this notification is displayed in public for a period of up to one month it will attract the interest of all those involved &mdash; caterers, florists, car hire companies, building societies, travel agents and Lord only knows who else will get in touch with the couple.  If the date of marriage is included <Col N="740" /> in the notification the happy couple would be well advised to take out insurance on their wedding presents as they may have unwelcome visitors on the day.  In the case of obituary notices houses of relatives have been burgled while they were at the funeral.  If this happened on the wedding day it would turn joy to sorrow.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister to be more specific and indicate if the date of marriage will be included in the notification which will be displayed in public?  I ask him to give this matter serious consideration in view of the difficulties I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Will the registrar be required to display the notification in the areas where each of the partners lives?  If so, the danger to which I referred will be heightened.</P>
    <P>There is another provision about which I am concerned and I would like to hear the Minister's observations on it.  It appears that the only person who will have a role in relation to the notification procedure is the registrar.  Will the churches have any role and, if not, why?  Most churches require the couple to give notice which is announced from the altar or, in some instances, displayed at the back of the church.  Is there another agenda?  I will listen to the Minister's reply before I come to any conclusion.  I think my concern is shared widely throughout the communty.  Are the churches not to be trusted in this matter?</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 33 for exemptions in relation to the requirement to give notification.  Section 33 (2) states that an application may be made to the court informally, that it may be heard and determined otherwise than in public &mdash; in other words, in private &mdash; that a court fee shall not be charged in respect of it and that it should not be granted unless the applicant shows that it is justified by serious reasons and in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage.  I can think of some serious reasons: one of the partners, or a close member of the family, may be terminally or seriously ill or to be posted abroad on active service, for example, to the Lebanon.  Can the Minister give us any other serious reasons and what advice <Col N="741" /> would he give in cases involving pregnancy &mdash; the reason for many rushed marriages?</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about family law reform it will have to give careful consideration to two other issues &mdash; access to the courts and court facilities. In the past the Minister voiced the opinion that justice is like the Ritz Hotel, it is open to all as long as they can afford to pay.  I ask him to bear this in mind in consideration of the Bill.  These matters must be addressed before this or any other Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which gives the courts the power to make financial provision for separated spouses, will be meaningless unless parties have free access to the courts.  There are not enough judges to cope with the existing work-load and not enough staff to cope with administration. Delays of up to two years in the Circuit Court are common.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Press</i> on 20 February last carried an article by Catherine McGuinness, Senior Counsel.  I was glad to hear that she has been appointed to the Bench, I congratulate her and those responsible for making this appointment. It is an excellent one and I am glad that she will specialise in family law.  In the <i>Sunday Press</i> she made the point that because marriage breakdown and family law cases are heard in camera no one knows the real level of marriage breakdown. She said that there are long delays and that &ldquo;such a situation is particularly damaging in the complex delicate situation of marriage breakdown&rdquo;.  To the very last she made sensible observations which I am confident she will contine to make on the Bench.</P>
    <P>We do not have a proper civil legal aid system.  Without it, this Bill, laudable though its aspirations may be, is of no use to a separated and impoverished spouse. Law centres will only deal with emergency cases.  Normal cases where a spouse is looking for maintenance often wait months for an appointment.  This is not the fault of the staff of the law centres; there are just not enough of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> The earning spouse has free access to the solicitor of his or her choice while the best the Department of Justice can come up with is a pilot scheme to allow plaintiffs to be referred through their law centre to a private solicitor in certain limited circumstances.  Civil legal aid is not cheap but we are going to have to bite the bullet.  We cannot purport to grant remedies if people cannot enforce their rights.</P>
    <P>This legislation extends the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.  Is the Minister familiar with the state of District Court buildings and can he seriously suggest that they are suitable for the transaction of sensitive family law cases? Many District Courts are held in community halls, dance halls and libraries. Even the so-called purpose-built courthouses are totally lacking in facilities. Consultations take place on the roadside. Both parties to a dispute are thrown together in overcrowded halls.  Many of the Circuit Courts are no better.  There are inadequate or non-existent consultation facilities.  There is no privacy and long queues of litigants wait together in hallways.  Although I welcome this legislation, without more court staff, more judges, better facilities and, most important, a proper civil legal aid scheme for family law cases, it will be irrelevant and meaningless.</P>
    <P>The best thing we can do in this international year of the family is to strengthen the support structures of the family. In most churches it is compulsory that two people contemplating marriage attend a pre-marriage course, but nowadays the only connections people have with the church are on marriage, at birth for the christening and at death for the burial.  There is, therefore, a strong argument for State involvement in pre-marriage preparation or State assistance for the churches and voluntary organisations involved in pre-marriage preparations.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on that note.  I fully accept the principle of the Bill but hope that on Committee Stage the questions I have posed will be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms. Keogh Ms. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy <Col N="743" /> Currie on his new portfolio as spokesman on equality and law reform and look forward to the many debates I am sure we will have.  I hope that we can count on his and his party's wholehearted support in ensuring a successful conclusion to the divorce referendum.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of the groundwork for the divorce referendum which we are to have in the autumn.  There is no one who would not in principle welcome a Bill which develops the corpus of legislation on marriage breakdown.  Unfortunately this legislation comes under a cloud of suspicion in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill and the High Court challenge to the 1989 Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill re-enacts much of that 1989 Act, and I too pay tribute to Deputy Alan Shatter for his work on that legislation. This Bill fills in gaps that have become evident since the enactment of the 1989 Act.  If that is a fair interpretation of what this Bill is, then we must be reassured on the constitutionality of the 1989 Act and this Bill.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister know of the challenge to the 1989 Act when formulating this legislation?  If so, is the Bill premature? If he did not, whose responsibility was it to make sure he did know?  Was it the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions or of the Attorney General?</P>
      <P>We have already received, through the Minister, assurances about the constitutionality of this Bill from the Attorney General.  However, I regret that my confidence in the Attorney General, and that of others, is shaken by a series of events which have marked his term of office.  Did the same person who reassured the Minister on this Bill inform him of the challenge to the constitutionality of the 1989 Act on which it is largely based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the present challenge in the High Court, has the Minister even considered the possibility that this Bill may be referred to the Supreme Court by the President for other reasons and that it is not inconceivable that a divorce <Col N="744" /> referendum will be introduced following the defeat of yet another Bill?  Has there been any exchange of information between the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecution and the Attorney General and the Government in advance of this proposed legislation?</P>
    <P>Those who have campaigned on equality issues and who have pledged their support to the Minister in the divorce referendum are going through a crisis of confidence and the Minister must be aware of this.  If he is not, it is not for the want of telling.  We must act in any way possible to alleviate genuine fears about such a referendum.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who fought for equality and for the rights of women. What I now fear is that in the midst of constitutional confusion key principles will be lost.  The disaster of the Matrimonial Home Bill is a case in point.  The Minister must revisit the principles contained in that Bill which provides spouses with adequate security in regard to the family home and property.  The Minister should listen to the practical information available from practitioners in family law on how best to move forward and secure an orderly and successful progression in the reform of family law.  Does the Minister have any plans to consult practitioners and the many agencies involved in this area in this regard?</P>
    <P>When I was elected to this House I wanted to bring about change and I still believe that is possible.  The Matrimonial Home Bill was seen as desirable and had cross-party support.  It is rare that a Bill would have such widespread support. Although it was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the Progressive Democrats do not accept that the matter should end there.  It is up to us as legislators to bring forward legislation that will achieve the principles outlined in that Bill and which will be constitutional. If we want something badly enough we try again and again until we get it right.  How many of the Deputies now in Dáil Éireann would still be in politics if they had given up at the first attempt?  I know I would not be.  That is the spirit we must have as legislators.  If <Col N="745" /> the principle is right we must uphold it and see it through.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that this Bill tries to come to terms with the deficit in the legislation and contains some good points.  Unfortunately some of the logic is inherently flawed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that where a legally recognisable divorce has been granted by a foreign court, under this legislation, Irish courts will, make financial orders where at least one spouse is domiciled in Ireland.  It is entirely appropriate that a wife, for example, resident in Ireland whose spouse has obtained a foreign divorce should be able to seek maintenance here if she would have been able to apply in the court where the divorce was granted.</P>
    <P>The effort to come to terms with pensions is also a positive move and another attempt to bridge the gaps in the Judicial Reform and Family Law Act, 1989.  The approach of this legislation, as was the case in 1989, allows considerable discretion to be given to the court to rearrange and adjust pension rights by splitting or earmarking pensions to protect the original spouse.  I heard a number of comments on the provisions of this legislation, for example, that the Bill repeals the provisions of the 1989 Act, re-enacts it and sticks in nullity.  I am sure all Members acknowledge that hardship can result from loss of succession rights if a marriage is annulled, especially if it involves an elderly or incapacitated spouse.  What is the feasibility of maintaining succession rights if it cuts across the rights of a spouse in a marriage contracted later?  Would there be inheritance tax implications in respect of pension orders after nullity?  All those questions must be teased out.</P>
    <P>At present many wives who believe they have grounds for nullity do not apply because they would not get maintenance, pension rights or property orders.  If this Bill is enacted there will be an increase in the numbers seeking annulments.  Will that be divorce Irish style, another half baked Irish solution to an Irish problem? I do not believe that will be the case, but we must be aware of it.  If the status of <Col N="746" /> the marriage entitles one spouse to apply for a property transfer order, will there be a constitutional difficulty in proposing that even though the parties were never married, nonetheless one can get a property transfer order?  If that is the case there is no argument against giving unmarried couples the same rights to property and maintenance orders and pension rights if the relationship breaks up.  As pointed out in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, in the absence of the possibility of remarrying some people whose marriages have broken down go on to form second unions outside marriage. Neither party to a second union enjoys the same legal protection available to parties to a marriage, but the children of such unions have been given full legal protection by the Status of Children Act, 1987.  There are many implications associated with holding a divorce referendum which must be examined further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Some Members mentioned raising the legal marriage age to 18, a sensible move which has been sought by a number of individuals and agencies in the past number of years.  I have no objection to requiring intending couples to give the Registrar of Marriages three months' notice of their intention to marry &mdash; the so-called cooling off period.  Some people have argued that one or two months' notice should be sufficient, but in my view a three month period is necessary. There is a difficulty in relation to noncompliance resulting in the marriage becoming void which can be examined on Committee Stage.  I do not see any reason for making the notification of a marriage available for public inspection, it is an unwarranted invasion of privacy, the constitutionality of which has been questioned.  While I do not envisage the Registry Office in Kildare Street being surrounded by the paparazzi, there are grounds for concern about the invasion of individuals' privacy.  I will be questioning the Minister on that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are many worthwhile provisions in the Bill.  I give the Minister an A for effort but a bare pass for achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> Many of the provisions need to be discussed in more detail.  The Minister said that the Bill was too long to go through it section by section, but we will have to spend a long time on Committee Stage teasing out a number of issues.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes considerable changes in the law on nullity which raises more difficulties and questions.  In considering that, we should recall the background to many family law cases for which free legal aid is required, some of which were outlined by Deputy Currie.  On numerous occasions in the past few months the Minister referred to the provision of extra funding for the free legal aid service, including the recruitment of more solicitors to deal with cases.  He said he was committed to assisting the support services with the substantial additional funding allocated to his Department for the family mediation and civil legal aid services.  I congratulate the Minister on his achievements to date, but the funding is still inadequate.  I have been told that solicitors with little or no experience in the complex area of family law have been recruited to provide the free legal aid service.  I hope we are not creating a two-tier system whereby some people &mdash; mainly women &mdash; do not receive the level of competence in service that their cases may require.</P>
    <P>As a result of this legislation, nullity cases will be heard in the Circuit Court. Initially that may appear to be a good move which will allow cases to be processed more speedily.  However, the reality is different.  Everyone knows of the delays in processing Circuit Court cases because there are not enough judges and until today we had no women judges at that level.  I congratulate Catherine McGuinness, Senior Counsel, on her appointment to the Bench.  We can be confident that we now have somebody with the necessary training and expertise in the area of family law.  I welcome her appointment.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation the Circuit Court will be called the circuit family court, even though everyone knows that is a big joke.  The Circuit Court sets aside one <Col N="748" /> day per session to deal with up to 50 family law cases and that is without transferring any more business to that court. How does the Minister expect us to take seriously a plan to move nullity cases to the Circuit Court knowing that such cases may take up to three or four days to conclude.  There is not enough time, not enough judges and only one woman judge.  This legislation does not refer to the training of judges or family tribunals which could deal with family cases outside the court system.  The physical and emotional toll on family litigants is already intolerable as a result of delays and lack of facilities at our courts.  In some cases there are consultations and negotiations on the street to avoid being overheard by the other side, at a time when people are at their most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>We must always stress the need for support for families and should restate the aims of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which encourages marriage counselling and mediation for separating couples.  Such services require more recognition and funding.  A strong case has been made for the reform of the family law system with an adequately resourced family law division in which psychologists and lawyers could work together with the children's welfare as their main priority.  That is the type of resource necessary and it should run in tandem with legal developments at all times.  There is only one probation officer available to carry out investigations and write reports on family law cases in the District Court and that service is not available in the Circuit Court, a serious inadequacy which must be addressed.  Many more gaps remain to be filled.</P>
    <P>The Minister received many representations from professionals and interest groups &mdash; those directly involved &mdash; to extend barring orders to include the barring of adult children and cohabiting couples.  It is disappointing that the Minister did not include those necessary provisions in this legislation.  He should communicate with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, who, I am sure, would support me in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> Organisations which contributed to conferences on violence against women have highlighted this point.  It is not just spouses who should be the subject of barring orders, it should be open also to the individual to apply for protection orders independently of barring orders in cases where that is the most appropriate measure.</P>
    <P>Suggestions I make in debate or in amendments are designed to ensure that the legislation we eventually agree will be as comprehensive as possible.  They are made in the context of the Minister having assured us that there will be a divorce referendum later this year.  An assurance is given in that regard in the programme for Government.  It is regrettable that it does not give a greater feeling of certainty about the constitutionality of Bills.  It would be unthinkable to have a 1986 type of referendum revisited.  That is why certainty and not reassurance is needed.  The reasons which led people to reject the proposal on divorce in 1986 need to be addressed.  This legislation can be part of the process and that is, why I support it.  I support it subject to amendment and on the basis that the 1989 Act, which is fundamental to the Bill, is constitutional, and that the Bill as presented will not be challenged as to its constitutionality.</P>

      <P>We in Democratic Left welcome the publication of the Bill. There are important measures in it which will resolve difficulties experienced in cases of martial breakdown.  The first and most important statement to make about the Bill is that it has nothing to do with divorce.  We have yet to hear proposals from the Government about divorce legislation.  It is time we did.  All we have had to date are Bills tidying existing arrangements, is the case with this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doomed Matrimonial Home Bill was ushered in by the Minister.  At that time he said that while there were many priority areas in his legislative programme the issue of joint ownership was one to which he assigned considerable importance.  Now that the Supreme Court has blown the Matrimonial Home <Col N="750" /> Bill out of the water it is worth noting how swiftly not just the Minister, but the Taoiseach and the rest of the Government, have pushed women in the home unceremoniously back to the end of the queue.  Apart from dashing women's hopes the débacle had another effect.  In the public debate the Matrimonial Home Bill became entangled with pending divorce legislation.  Inevitably, when the Bill collapsed so did much of the public confidence in the capability of the Government to frame legislation on divorce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Supreme Court decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Government's actions subsequent to the Supreme Court decision.  I am not referring to the Supreme Court decision.  The Government put the Matrimonial Home Bill in the bin by ignoring the need to establish joint ownership in the manner to which it gave a commitment.</P>
      <P>The Bill is about maintenance, property rights following nullity, raising the legal age for marriage, pension rights following nullity and foreign divorce, among other matters.  It is not part of divorce legislation or even part of the building blocks of divorce legislation.  It stands alone.  Inevitably, the context in which it is being brought in cannot be disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That context is one in which there is no such thing as an Irish divorce.  The Bill extends the legal remedies available in a judicial separation situation to the law of nullity.  The law of nullity is a legal procedure to determine whether a valid marriage has taken place.  The main areas are lack of capacity, nonobservance of formalities, absence of consent, insanity, intention not to fulfil a fundamental term of importence.  Because of a lack of divorce the concept of nullity has become elastic.  It has developed and expanded over the years to grant remedies where divorce would be more appropriate.  If divorce were made available it is likely that the growing number of couples seeking annulment of their marriage would decrease.  At present in <Col N="751" /> each case the justice of the nullity case may have demanded an annulment it would be far me appropriate for our Legislature to introduce divorce legislation than to develop the law of nullity.</P>
    <P>Annulment of marriage is allowed by the Catholic Church in certain circumstances. The development of State annulment parallels that of church annulments. For example, the development of the concept of the intention to fulfil a fundamental term was first developed by the Catholic Church.  It reached a ridiculous stage when it was held that the breakdown of a marriage many years later was proof that one of the parties did not intend to fulfil a fundamental term at the date of the marriage.  Such thinking should not have a place in our law.  Many people would be surprised to hear that State nullity exists.  Many believe a church annulment is the only kind that is obtainable.  However, it is clear from the growth in the number of annulments that people are using annulment as a form of Irish divorce.  It is an extremely expensive procedure and costs approximately £8,000.  One must either be well off or qualify for free legal aid to be able to proceed with an annulment case.  A tragic position may exist where one partner may be in that happy position while the other may have difficulty securing equal legal representation.</P>
    <P>I know of at least one case pending at the moment where the couple have been married for a long time.  The husband is taking a nullity case against the wife, and she is not in a position to pay for her legal representation, nor is she eligible to avail of free legal aid because her income is just over the limit.  It is extraordinary after many years of marriage and having had a large family that a case stating the marriage never existed is now being taken against that women's will.  The cost of High Court action is adding considerably to her anguish as is the knowledge that if her husband wins the case she will lose her right to the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>In recent times, much attention has been focused on the impact of marital <Col N="752" /> breakdown on children.  The Exeter report is the most recent report in which there is evidence that marital breakdown has a damaging effect on children.  This is a feature we live with in Ireland without totally comprehending it, or without tackling it in any real structured way. That is something we must come to terms with because marital breakdown figures indicate it is a growing problem.  The nonavailability of divorce has done nothing to stem the rate of growth of marital breakdown and there is an onus on us, as a society, to provide damage limitation to those children.  In the case of nullity a marriage is obliterated from the record even after many years.  Such an experience causes great trauma to all members of the family involved.</P>
    <P>The expansion of nullity in Ireland &mdash; there has been an expansion of it both in interpretation and in the numbers coming forward for nullity &mdash; is a major argument for the provision of divorce.  If we do not introduce divorce we will see the continuing expansion of nullity as a means of escape from marital breakdown. It is a totally inappropriate way out for the majority of marital breakdown cases.  Surely it should be the exception rather than the rule to decide that a marriage which has broken down never actully existed.  It is more honest, fair and realistic for us, as a society, to say that a marriage has broken down and provision must be made for those within the family. Partners must be free if they choose to have a second chance and to remarry.  If anyone doubts that the rate of nullity cases is increasing, I would refer them to the figures from the Legal Aid Board which show a steady increase.  In the period 1990-91, the Legal Aid Board took up proceedings on nullity in 33 cases.  In the year 1992-93 there were 43 cases of nullity and in the last year for which we do not have up-to-date figures it is expected that the figure will be higher.  Those figures are only in respect of cases for which there is an application for free legal aid.  There were 58 applications for nullity in 1991, in 1992 there were 60 and in 1993 there were 71.</P>
    <P>There is a remarkable increase in the <Col N="753" /> figures for judicial separation.  In 1990, 200 cases were dealt with through the Legal Aid Board; in 1991 there were 420 cases and in 1992-93 there were between 600 to 700 cases.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is part of the Irish experience and we should not try to pretend it is anything other than part of what we are.  It has grown inexorably.  That growth puts additional demands on the courts and legislators to deal with the outstanding matters of property rights, maintenance and particularly the care of children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sections of the Bill that deal with maintenance payments.  There have been many cases where women have had great difficulty in extracting their entitlements from their spouses and, in order to do so, have had to make the most demeaning efforts.</P>
    <P>The proposal to make maintenance payments more effective is a great improvement and I welcome it. However, as the Matrimonial Home Bill was produced in the shadow of a constitutional case, this Bill is being produced in the shadow of a constitutional case that is under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been pursuing an active HIV-AIDS Strategy since the infection became known in the early 1980s.  This strategy has been developed since then in line with national and international requirements and was given an impetus in 1992 with the establishment of an intersectoral, expert group, known as the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  The committee conducted a thorough examination of the whole area of HIV-AIDS under the following headings: care and management of persons with HIV-AIDS; education and prevention strategies; measures to avoid discrimination against persons with HIV-AIDS and HIV-AIDS surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations made in each of these areas assisted me in allocating substantial additional funding to develop HIV-AIDS programmes and services since 1992.  The funding allowed a number of innovative measures to be introduced including: the establishment of community-based primary care clinics to help prevent the spread of infection and to provide a wide range of services at primary level in the Eastern Health Board area, including services to drug abusers; the creation of a new infectious diseases consultant post in the MaterBeaumont Hospitals to provide a HIV-AIDS service; the provision of capital and human resources in other acute hospitals, such as St. James's Hospital, Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Cork Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway; support for existing services both statutory and voluntary, in the Eastern, Mid-Western, Southern and Western Health Board areas; the implementation of a new comprehensive nationwide HIV-surveillance programme to assess more accurately the spread of the infection as a basis for the planning of programmes and services; the amendment of the family planning legislation to allow for easy access to condoms generally and for condoms to be distributed free of charge to particular atrisk <Col N="755" /> groups, and the delivery of regular public information programmes.</P>
    <P>A feature of the AIDS Strategy is the emphasis placed on prevention through education and this is being implemented in the formal educational system, through the AIDS Information Programme developed jointly by the Departments of Health and Education.  I am satisfied that the Government's AIDS Strategy provides a comprehensive, cohesive framework for action in this area and that it will form the basis for continuing action, both preventative and treatment-based, in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very kind remarks and I look forward to fruitful and beneficial exchanges with him.  Has the Minister evaluated the effectiveness of the AIDS awareness programme? Has he appointed a national co-ordinator who may be in a position to indicate the benefit of the actions taken so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I chair the national committee and while we have retained the services of the former national co-ordinator on a consultative basis, I am satisfied that ongoing monitoring at health board level, co-ordinated directly by my Department, is the best way to provide the service.  On the evaluation of AIDS awareness programmes, last year a new type of programme was embarked upon which was initially resisted by individuals in the media but proved to be an impacted programme.  It is very difficult to say whether that programme reached all the at-risk groups.  We will be renewing the programme this year and will learn from the information gathered from last year's programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it would be better to appoint an individual with precise responsibility in that area, such as a national AIDS co-ordinator? As such an appointment was envisaged, has the Minister changed his mind in that regard?  Will he indicate whether he and his Department have got <Col N="756" /> ahead of the problem in terms of identification of the scale of infection and spread of the disease, so that the public can be given some idea as to the progress, if any, of the programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of debate as to whether one individual should co-ordinate the whole strategy.  The strategy is based on our components, each of which is monitored by a sub-committee which meets regularly.  That is the way to proceed rather than appoint one person with general responsibility in this area. Ultimately, it is my responsibility to ensure there is in place a cohesive and effective campaign.  We have clear information on the people who are most at risk in the community.  I have had discussions with, for example, representatives of the gay community to work out a more effective Outreach programme to support them.  I have also considered campaigns to outreach intravenous drug abusers in Dublin, who are a significant source of infection, with a view to ensuring safer practices in that area.  A multi-sectoral approach needs to be taken to this issue, co-ordinated by the committee and subcommittees which are, ultimately, answerable to me.</P>

      <P>At an international level, Ireland contributes to HIV research through our financial and other contributions to WHO and the European Union.  We participate in the work of the joint WHO-European Union Centre on AIDS in Paris and the AIDS Advisory Committee of the European Union.  The Paris centre conducts epidemiological research into the spread of the HIV virus, the results of which can be of valuable assistance in planning the development of HIV-AIDS services.  The AIDS Advisory Committee considers grant applications for HIV-AIDS related projects, including those involving research.  Both bodies also endeavour to ensure that the member states, as far as possible, do not duplicate research projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At national level, the surveillance sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee meets on a regular basis to monitor developments in relation to the spread of HIV-AIDS.  The sub-committee considers and reviews any information, national or international, which is available.  It also makes recommendations about surveillance programmes which might provide <Col N="759" /> information about the prevalance and sources of infection of HIV-AIDS in Ireland.  At present, all ante-natal bloods are tested for HIV on an anonymous unlinked basis to provide information about the prevalance of the virus in the heterosexual population.  It is intended in the coming months to extend this anonymous unliked programme to STD clinics and then to certain out-patient categories.</P>
    <P>In addition to these surveillance programmes, bodies such as the Health Research Board and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland commission research projects from time to time with the object of providing further information about HIV-AIDS.  Both bodies are involved in research projects where the emphasis is on the primary care of persons who are HIV positive.  The Royal College of Surgeons project involves providing a wide range of services for HIV infected persons, including prescribing early intervention medicines and monitoring their immune systems.  The Health Research Board project involves research into opportunistic infection in AIDS, with particular reference to such infection in the oral cavities, as the early manifestations of the HIV virus occur there.  The cost of both these projects is approximately £120,000 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of tests are being carried out.  We have to be mindful of the relatively small number of HIV-AIDS cases here relative to some other European countries and the proportion <Col N="760" /> of health research money available in comparison to some of our larger European partners.  I outlined the position in regard to HIV research.  The clinical trials conducted by the genito-urinary medicine department of St. James's Hospital involve an examination of the interaction of AZT with other drugs.  A total of £8.4 million is spent on HIV-AIDS services.  This is in addition to the normal allocation to hospitals and the community care money which provides some services for AIDS patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not diminishing the extent of the problem, but I would point out that although the number of AIDS cases here is much smaller than in some other European countries, our population is also much smaller.  Given the size of the Health budget, the allocation by the Government for research into HIV-AIDS is not significant in comparison to the contribution of other governments.  The level of funding for research is very small and should be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <P>I am in the process of substantially increasing the funding for this year, a process which I hope to continue. The Health Research Board evaluates all submissions made to it by either clinicians or research authorities who wish to continue a particular project.  I am sure the Health Research Board favourably considers all applications for funding for research projects in the area <Col N="761" /> of HIV-AIDS which have merit, which have a chance of being useful and which do not duplicate research work carried out elsewhere in the European Union.  I hope to allocate increased funding for health research, which is essential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what he said, is the Minister disappointed that the number of HIV positive patients is increasing at an alarming rate in Ireland and worldwide?  As we are not getting to grips with the reducing or restricting the number of HIV positive patients, perhaps his Department will consider new prevention measures in this area.  Does the Minister have any plans in this respect?  Is there any relationship between the HIV virus and hepatitis C and does one lead to the other, a question very much on people's minds at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the incredible resources available for research in this area, particularly in the United States, there is very little likelihood of Ireland having the wherewithal in terms of resources to find a cure for AIDS.  We have marvellous scientists who have contributed greatly to individual research projects, but the scale of research in this area elsewhere is so massive that it would be foolish to try to compete with it.  The bulk of our resources has been channelled towards the treatment of patients with HIV-AIDS and to finding more effective methods of treatment, including a better drugs regime, for example, the use of AZT and other combinations of drugs.</P>
      <P>Although it is not related to the Deputy's initial question, the question in regard to the relationship between hepatitis C and HIV is very important.  There is no connection between hepatitis C and HIV; there is no question of hepatitis C leading to HIV.  Tests are being carried out at present to ascertain if people have been contaminated with the hepatitis C virus.  People whose test is negative have obviously no infection while people whose test is positive will have hepatitis C only.</P>

We have been working for a long time on a national health strategy which, I hope, will be ready for publication shortly.  This issue will be considered in the context of that strategy.</P>

    <P>*Provisional figures.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit, in my Department recently produced a leaflet entitled, Family Planning and Contraception. This leaflet contains information on a range of contraception options, how they work and important points to consider in their use.  These leaflets will be available through health centres, pharmacists, general practitioners and family planning clinics. They can be used also as a resource in educational contexts where people are learning about family planning and contraception.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has produced a set of guidelines for post-primary schools on the development of sex/relationships education and I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, is reviewing further the position in this area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that family planning advice and contraceptives are available throughout the country.  The challenge which we face is to ensure that those young people who are sexually active are aware where advice can be obtained and use these services.  It is also vitally important that they are aware of and have access to all of the services available at an early stage during and after pregnancy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the questions tabled by Deputies Flaherty, Hogan and Mitchell, the position is that under section 8 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992 and article 2 of the Health (Family Planning) Regulations, 1992 health boards are responsible for providing and/or making available a family planning service.  Future policy in relation to the provision of a comprehensive <Col N="765" /> family planning service will be addressed also in the health strategy document, which will be published shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern about the increasing level of teenage pregnancies?  The figures to which he has referred indicate a steady increase over the years and EUROSTAT data shows that we have a higher rate of teenage pregnancies than either the UK or Denmark.  Does the Minister consider this to be a serious matter, in particular the health risks involved for young mothers and the undesirability generally to have children at a young age?  Is the Minister satisfied that health centres throughout the country provide a full family planning service?  Can he give that undertaking?  Does he have information as to how young people are acquiring family planning information?  The Coombe study indicates that young people are not getting the information they need; while they are availing of condoms there seems to be a distinct lack of understanding or awareness of their own bodily functions and how they can prevent pregnancy.  Does the Minister agree that the distribution of a leaflet &mdash; desirable as that may be &mdash; is not the answer to this phenomenon that is growing in Ireland?  Will he specify in the national health strategy the objectives he intends to reach in relation to the levels of teenage pregnancy, which are extraordinary here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the number of teenage pregnancies is cause for concern for society in general.  That is why we have embarked on an education process in the first instance which is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education.  On the provision <Col N="766" /> of family planning services, the health boards are responsible for this. The policy is implemented through the health boards; information and advice is widely available and the health centres, general practitioners and voluntary bodies, for example, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, the National Association for Ovulation, the Irish Family Planning Association, Dublin Well Woman Centre and others, provide a service to some degree also.  In addition, approximately 700 GPs have completed the Irish Family Planning Association ICGP joint training certificate and a further 800 nurses have been trained and received certificates in family planning. The expansion of the family planning process and the evaluation of the service to date will be addressed in the national health strategy and the Deputy will forgive me if I do not pre-empt that strategy by disclosing its contents until it is published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister cannot divulge the contents of the national strategy but does he intend to allocate funding to this area?  If I walk into any health centre in rural Ireland today, can I obtain a comprehensive family planning service?  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not what I said.  I said the health boards are responsible under the law for the provision of family planning services throughout the country. There are gaps in the service, there is no doubt about that; I would not be addressing the matter otherwise.  In relation to the approach I intend to take and the various costings involved, I would prefer to leave those matters until the national health strategy is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 14 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>There are a total of 1,436 patients on the waiting list for cardiac surgery in the Mater Hospital and 62 awaiting cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Mater Hospital that there is a patient on their waiting list since July 1987.  However, the admission of a patient to hospital for cardiac surgery is a clinical decision taken by the consultant concerned, based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.</P>
      <P>The number of people who die while on hospital waiting lists is not routinely collected by my Department or by hospitals.  The Deputy will appreciate that the death of a person may not be related in any way to the condition for which the patient has been listed for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, some 14 months ago I have been concerned to ensure the expansion of existing facilities for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector.  In 1993, I allocated an additional £1 million from the waiting list fund to improve the capacity of the National Cardiac Surgery Unit at the Mater Hospital. An additional sum in excess of £2 million has been allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments for 1994.  I am very conscious of the need to provide additional coronary <Col N="770" /> artery by-pass graft &mdash; CABG &mdash; procedures. This injection of funds will bring the annual output at the Mater Hospital of CABGs up to 1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>This major programme of refurbishment at the National Cardiac Surgical Centre at the Mater Hospital has been ongoing since the middle of last year and is now nearing completion.  The development includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high-dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme, including heart transplantation.</P>
    <P>This injection of extra resources will enable additional staff to be recruited and extra medical equipment to be put in place so that these facilities can function to their required potential.</P>
    <P>A £2 million capital development at Cork Regional Hospital, consisting of an additional cardiac theatre and extra intensive cardiac care facilities, is due for completion in August 1994.  The coming on stream of this development, together with the developments in progress at the National Cardiac Centre at the Mater Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the capacity for heart by-passes to be performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by a factor of 47 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is aware of the problem.  It is not satisfactory, no matter on what ground that somebody should have been on the waiting list since 1987.  This is simply appalling and reflects very badly on our overall medical services.  Would the Minister agree that this should not happen?  Would he agree that the need for cardiac surgery will continue to grow substantially and that, while he has allocated funds, they will not be sufficient to meet the growth in demand for cardiac surgery in ensuing years?  Has the Minister a plan in place which will take us to the stage at which a person will be able to have cardiac surgery within a maximum of 12 months of being diagnosed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I would agree <Col N="771" /> that a waiting time of the order indicated is not satisfactory.  I do not know the circumstances of the case, the conditions, whether the person was suitable for surgery at any given time, or whether there was need to wait.  I said almost from the moment I became Minister that I was not happy with the level of capacity for heart surgery.  That is why I set about immediately providing very significant additional resources which will have the effect of increasing the throughput at the Mater Hospital from 750 cases to 1,000 cases annually and that at the Cork Regional Hospital from 200 cases to 400 cases, a doubling of the Cork hospitals capacity and a 30 per cent increase in the Dublin capacity.  I believe that the 1,400-case capacity which will be in place by the middle of this year &mdash; obviously involving a lot of capital works &mdash; is sufficient to meet what is now the annual figure.  In theory, nobody should have to wait longer than 12 months for such surgery. Obviously I am aware that there may be an increased demand for this facility &mdash; that is something we really cannot envisage. It might be necessary to re-examine in the future either the extension of those facilities or the creation of new facilities elsewhere in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before posing my question, I should like to pay tribute to the consultant at the Cork Regional Hospital who is working there alone.  Everything ceases when he is either ill or on holiday. Has the Minister plans to appoint a second cardiothoracic surgeon to Cork Regional Hospital?  There is no point in providing facilities unless a second consultant is appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the need for cardiac surgery is a very daunting and worrying one for the families of patients?  In those circumstances, would he not agree that it <Col N="772" /> would be wise to identify patients who are ready for such surgery, so designated by their consultants, in order to eliminate those who may not be capable of surgery at present, thus identifying the actual list of people waiting and deal with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very important issue, which is the whole validation of waiting lists.  One of the positive effects of the initiative on the waiting list last year was that we had the capacity to address very significant volumes of work and re-evaluate waiting lists.  We discovered there were people on waiting lists who, in some instances, had not been appropriately placed.  I am not suggesting that that is the case of the waiting list for cardiac surgery.  There is constant need for evaluation and validation of waiting lists.  The only way is to have a sufficient capacity available so that nobody can be expected to wait an inordinately long period of time.  That is my objective.  Other important factors I should mention are the causes of cardiovascular disease, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, nutritional programmes and exercise, in particular campaigns against smoking, including the one I launched on Ash Wednesday.  These are extremely important in reduing the demand for this type of surgery.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that an assessment in 1992 of 63 primary schools in County Sligo by the Radiological Institute of Ireland indicated that over half these schools had radon levels above the reference of 150 becquerels per cubic metre while in other areas where similar assessments were carried out only one twentieth of the schools were above the reference level; that in a population-weighted survey of houses in County Sligo organised by the Physics Department of UCG, the average radon levels recorded were twice the national average with one house recording 1,342 becquerels per cubic metre of air as compared with a reference level of 200 above which the need for remedial action should be considered; that, in all, 16 per cent of the 25 houses where measurements were taken in County Sligo were above the 200 reference level; and, if in view of all of these findings on the limited surveys to date, clearly indicating very significant radon levels right throughout County Sligo with the danger to health implicit in this and with obvious need for remedial action to be taken in houses as is now being undertaken in the schools surveyed, he will consider some special scheme or initiative which would lead to a general scheme of measurements for radon being undertaken and promoted for the county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 9 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out in north Kerry by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in 1990 showed that the area is not a potential high risk one for radon. That will be a great relief to the Deputy. The average radon level found there was well below the national recorded average.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Southern Health Board that the levels of cancer in Kerry are lower than in the rest of the Southern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>In County Sligo the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is undertaking radon measurements in 260 houses as part of a national geographical survey on radon.</P>
      <P>The national survey involves radon measurements being made in over 6,000 homes nationwide.  The data produced by the survey will help identify areas at greatest risk from high radon levels and assist in deciding what preventive measures, if any, need to be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="774" /> of a survey undertaken by Dr. Jim McLoughlin of UCD between 1985 and 1989 which showed that the average radon reading for North Kerry was 68 becquerels per cubic metre of air, nearly twice the average for other parts of the country?</P>
      <P>Is he aware that in one townland the reading was 522 becquerels?  Surely that gives rise to concern.  There has been a significant increase in the number of cancer patients in Kerry in recent years. Is he aware of the connection between radon poisoning and lung cancer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The last north Kerry survey carried out in 1990 involved 90 houses and the average radon value was 31 becquerels per square metre compared with the national average of 60 becquerels per square metre.  As regards cancer, the statistics are supplied by the southern tumour registry based in Cork and indicate lower levels of cancer in Kerry than the average for the southern health board region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter might be more appropriate to the Minister for the Environment.  I would be concerned if there were inordinate levels of radon gas anywhere.  It is a natural gas and certain areas are known to be affected.  We must include in the building regulations such precautions as will minimise the seepage of the gas into the homes, schools or other places where people congregate.  A national survey is underway and when the findings are available it is proposed to look at and isolate regions which have an above average level for further action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey is ongoing and we cannot draw conclusions until it has concluded.  I will keep a watching brief for my Department.  The Ministers for the Environment and Education requested the institute to carry out a survey of schools in County Sligo and they will watch the results.  When we determine the national pattern we will be able to see where there are abnormal levels of radon gas.  Either a further detailed analysis will be required or a policy of action will have to be identified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the national survey is assessing a large enough sample to be accurate?  The figure of 90 houses seems very small.  We are concerned about the extent of radon gas in Wicklow and of cancer in south and south west Wicklow.  Does the Minister have a breakdown within counties of clusters of cancer?  If you take a county, the level could be perfectly acceptable but within that there could be clusters that might cause concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the scale of the survey I yield to the wisdom of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the responsible statutory body. It decided that a survey of 6,000 homes nationally would give it the data it requires.  It expects to complete its findings in 1995.  It is the expert body and who am I to disagree with it?</P>
      <P>I have given consideration to the question of cancer clusters.  I was happy this year to inaugurate the national cancer registry in Cork which, for the first time, will give us information on the occurrence of cancer on a national basis. Although the data will need to be built on over the years before we have a discernible pattern, in future we will have a mechanism through which to identify such clusters and take appropriate action.</P>

My question today, No. 62, refers to Dungarvan-Abbeyside and I suspect that the incidence in that town may be considerably higher than the national average and the trend in County Waterford.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 62 was not linked to these because the others referred to the prevalence of radon gas while the Deputy's relates to cancer.  I am not sure if the data, in an isolated case, could identify a cluster.  I am informed that several year's analyses will be needed before reaching a conclusion. I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience I suspect there is an above average incidence of the disease and it is probably related to the presence of radon gas.  I do not ask the question lightly because it is disturbing for the public to feel that the incidence of cancer might be higher than the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult for any agency to identify the causes of cancer as it can be caused by a variety of environmental factors.  Much thought has been given to assessing the damage from Sellafield.  It is difficult to get conclusive proof that any cancer or damage is caused exclusively by one factor and it would be difficult to establish the cause of a group of cancers.  The establishment this year of the national cancer registry will give us a national pattern.  We can examine a number of other factors such as wind conditions, the prevalence of winds and so on.  I will pass on the Deputy's comments to see if further action can be taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 138 together.  I am advised by the Southern Health Board that Kenmare District Hospital, which serves a catchment area of approximately 6,000 people has a complement of 26 beds.  Long-stay accommodation is not provided in the hospital.  Patients from the catchment area, who require long-stay accommodation are admitted to St. Columbanus Home, Killarney.</P>
      <P>There was a proposal in the late 1970s to provide a ten bed extension to Kenmare District Hospital to accommodate long-stay patients from the area at an estimated cost of £275,000.  However, this project did not proceed.</P>
      <P>Recent developments in Kenmare District Hospital have included the provision of two day rooms, which were provided by the Friends of Kenmare District Hospital at a cost of £25,000 which was obtained through local fund raising.  The Kerry Hospice Foundation has also donated funds to upgrade one of the bedrooms in the hospital for very ill patients. The Southern Health Board is satisfied that good use is being made of the existing facilities at Kenmare District Hospital and it is not considered that there is a need for an extension to the hospital at this time.</P>
      <P>The board will shortly be formulating a plan, for the future development of community care and a plan for the development of district hospitals and the role of Kenmare and other district hospitals will be formally looked at in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The MRI facility at Beaumont Hospital was provided on the basis that it would serve both public and private patients, with private patients paying a charge for the facility.  The funding arrangements for this facility, both capital and revenue, were based on the income that would be generated from both public and private sources.  The arrangements in relation to the charges were communicated to all health boards and voluntary hospitals by my Department in July 1993.  Where health boards or other public hospitals refer public patients to Beaumont Hospital for this service, the charge is made on the agency making the referral not on the individual public patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an MRI facility is a very expensive state-of-the-art service, referral Protocols for the use of this service have been circulated to all health boards and voluntary hospitals.  These Protocols are essential to maximise the clinical efficacy of the facilities and to ensure that all suitable patients obtain access to the service. <Col N="779" /> I understand that the referral Protocols are working well in practice, and that any queries which have arisen have been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>While the clinical indications for emergency MRI examinations are relatively few, the appointment system for MRI scans at Beaumont Hospital provides that emergency cases are given priority where necessary.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, it has not been possible to identify the patient, based on the information supplied.  In order to investigate the matter further details would be required as to the name and address of the patient, the nature of the emergency and whether the case was discussed with a consultant radiologist at Beaumont Hospital.  If the Deputy wishes to communicate these details to me, I would be happy to look into the circumstances of this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the position as set out in the question is an example of the haphazard approach to the delivery of hospital services?  There are now four magnetic resonance images scanners in the Dublin area at a cost of approximately £2 million per machine while there is no such facility in the rest of the country.  Every year at least 100 people from the Cork-Kerry region have to travel to Dublin at a cost of £400 per scan, plus travelling expenses and inconvenience.  Will the Minister agree it is time the voluntary, public and private hospitals came together with a view to setting up an integrated and organised approach to the delivery of high-tech medicine?  This is a symptom of the fragmented way in which everybody is doing their own thing.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the delivery of the public health service, for which I have responsibility, is haphazard. Unfortunately, I have no control over the purchasing policies of the private <Col N="780" /> hospitals.  If a number of private hospitals want to compete with each other and decide to buy an expensive item of equipment I have no control over that.  We can sustain one machine in the public sector which is in Beaumont Hospital.  That machine was acquired at a good price in co-operation with Northern Ireland&mdash;the only one in Northern Ireland&mdash;was bought at the time we bought the machine for Beaumont, thus reducing the cost significantly to the Exchequer.  I want to have supported the practice of private medicine in the public hospital sector, first, to ensure that private patient moneys is available in public hospitals and, second, to ensure that the best consultants remain in the public campus and do not go to private practice.  The Protocols agreed for the MRI scanner at Beaumont Hospital are in the public interest.  Unfortunately, I have not control over the purchasing practices of private hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has been successful already in getting a consultant for Cork.  He should be content with one outing in the day.  I have requests for very expensive high-tech machinery from every region.  I am satisfied that the current level of facility for MRI scans is sufficient.  In determining the expenditure of scarce resources I must be sure when spending £2 million on an item of equipment there is an absolute and compelling reason for it.  If we had six such scanners they would be an additional diagnostic tool but I have to be convinced that new equipment significantly adds years to life or life to years before I approve it.</P>

      <P>That is not the case and I would not like the Deputy to mislead anybody in that regard.  The facility in Beaumont is primarily for public patients.  Only three complaints have been received about access from clinicians since the machine was installed, all of which, on consultation with the radiologist concerned, have been satisfactorily resolved.  An evaluation of the use of the machine has been carried out by a clinician from the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.  The final draft report of the evaluation, which has been received in my Department, concluded that the MRI is providing an effective and efficient service.</P>

One third of the population is based in Dublin and there is one MRI scanner available in the public health services.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 29 and 61 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there is an imbalance in the health care budget as applied to psychiatric care.  Following publication of the report of a study group on the development of psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, in 1984 a policy of diverting patients from a predominantly institutional form of care to more appropriate community-based care facilities has been pursued vigorously in line with a key recommendation of the report.  During this period many elderly patients and persons with a mental handicap were transferred from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate accommodation. For instance in 1981, 2,170 patients with a mental handicap were receiving in-patient care in psychiatric hospitals.  In 1992, this total had reduced <Col N="784" /> to 950.  With the transfer of these categories of patients to more appropriate care programmes and settings, expenditure on the care of these patients transferred to either the mental handicap or elderly services.  Obviously it had an impact on the total level of funding for psychiatric care.</P>
    <P>In line with a second key recommendation of Planning for the Future, psychiatric units are being provided in general hospitals.  There are currently 14 of these units in operation and seven more are planned to open.  The operating budgets for these units are included in the general hospital programme and not in the psychiatric services programme.</P>
    <P>The psychiatric budget does not include expenditure arising from the care provided by general practitioners for the mentally ill.  I am confident that the funds to be made available to my Department under the health commitments of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work will ensure the continued development of community psychiatric services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern expressed by people working in the psychiatric services that while the proposals are acceptable, there is a gap in that the Minister's intentions are genuine and he is providing the outlines of the original proposals but there seems to be an area where he falls between two stools in that the diminution of the institutional care services is not being automatically replaced with the required facilities in the community-based area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that that is the case.  We were careful to learn from experiences, particularly in the UK, in this regard.  There has been a dramatic shift in the psychiatric population base. Many people with mental handicap who should not have been in psychiatric hospitals are now being properly treated in the mental handicap sector.  I was pleased this year to significantly increase for the second year the resources available in mental handicap services up to an additional £25 million, as promised in <Col N="785" /> the Labour party manifesto for the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what concerns me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of modern opinion is that other categories of people, for example those with alcohol problems, are more properly treated in the community setting.  We are trying to do that more and more, although such people still constitute a significant proportion of psychiatric hospital admissions.  In the past, people who had become a bit senile were inappropriately put into psychiatric hospitals and that is being addressed.  The numbers in psychiatric institutions have fallen because people are more appropriately placed in the expanding health services in the community.  Also, the development of acute psychiatric units in the general hospitals is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a political argument with the Minister when he refers to manifestos and programmes for Governments but I would ask him to be more aware that the rush from institutional care into community-based care is not working.  We see the evidence of people discharged from institutional care in our cities and towns. There is inadequate community care and back up services.  The Minister should be more sensitive to the required balance, which is not being achieved.  There are many unfortunate victims of modern day thinking on psychiatric care.  The Minister should be aware that there is now a shortage of long term acute beds in our psychiatric services.  There are places in private institutions but not in the public health services.  Will the Minister ensure that in future psychiatric services are not the Cinderella of the health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the growing number of services at community level and that is something I want to develop and to fund.  Significant new community facilities have been put in place, particularly in the child care area, in the last 12 months.  Psychiatric services must be <Col N="786" /> addressed and additional funding is needed.  There is a balance to be struck and I do not envisage that all the psychiatric patients currently in psychiatric institutions will be appropriately placed in the community.  Many people who have spent the greater part of their lives in psychiatric institutions would find such a wrench too great, but there are a number of people who could be appropriately placed in the community and I am trying to phase that in as effectively as I can.  I had two meetings in recent times with the representative organisations of psychiatric nurses and with SIPTU, who have been supportive and co-operative in this development.  I understand some of their real fears.  I will be mindful of the Deputy's comments and I agree that there is some basis for us to hasten slowly in some regard.  I am not aware of a shortage of long term acute beds.  That problem has certainly not been brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister visited any psychiatric institutions since the publication of the Labour Party manifesto? If so, will he confirm that he has seen at first hand the need for the provision of adequate facilities for the patients in institutional care, even on a scaled down basis, in tandem with adequate facilities in the community care sector, to ensure that patients discharged into the community are adequately catered for?  Will he also confirm that satisfactory patient-staff ratios are being maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The manifesto refers to the mentally handicapped services.  I am very pleased that a significantly underfunded area received a significant increase in funding during difficult times since I became Minister.  I am very proud of that and I make no bones about it. However, we have a long way to go and a range of services are required to meet the needs of the mentally handicapped in the community.  The numbers are increasing because mentally handicapped people are living longer, their life expectancy has increased remarkably during the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> I take the opportunity to visit as many centres as I can across the country.  I have certainly visited centres in every province and virtually every county in the past 14 months and I will continue to do so.  The provision on the mentally handicapped side is the responsibility of the co-ordinating committees which were established in each health board area to identify needs, to determine the best mix of services and, subsequently, to apply for funding for them.  I am doing my best to provide the funding on the basis of demand.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Green Paper on mental illness we have been working on a strategic approach to the psychiatric services.  Having received over 100 submissions and evaluated them we are very close to publishing a White Paper and I hope to introduce legislation shortly after that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the question of the patient-staff ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister on this matter as I do not accept that the requisite facilities have been put in place in the community.  The Minister's statistics show a huge drop in the numbers in institutional care but these people have been discharged into the community. The Minister is making the mistake of thinking it is a satisfactory solution to discharge people from hospital into the community when in fact a great deal of trauma and stress is caused not only to the patient but to the families trying to look after them.  Does the Minister agree?  Community facilities to deal with these people on a day-to-day basis do not exist throughout the country and some patients are falling through an invisible hole as a result.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a direct statement that the Tallaght Hospital project will go ahead even if Euro funding is not available.  I hope he will not take money from much needed investment in community facilities throughout the country to cater for patients discharged into the community &mdash; a move we all applaud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be lucky if he had one.</P>
      <P>The Deputy cannot criticise me for enacting all the progressive reports on appropriately placing people who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals.  That accounts for the fall in numbers.  Most of these people are now appropriately placed and resources have been significantly increased for the community services I listed.  The Deputy cannot say there is insufficient funding for community services and yet refer in the same breath to a pool of money I can rob to invest in Tallaght Hospital.  The Deputy cannot argue both ways at once. If a pool of money is provided for community services, the Deputy must acknowledge they are provided.  I am determined to make advances, not only in the area of community care for the elderly and children but for mentally handicapped and community psychiatric half-way houses in a planned way.  A very good division in the Department is resourcing, monitoring and enacting the programme.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated my gratitude to the health service workers and their representative organisations for being so co-operative in this significant change in their work practices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 27, 48 and 53.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge there is a problem to be addressed in relation to balance billing by consultants.  However, it is a complex issue which must be resolved in a way which is acceptable to patients, consultants and insurers.</P>
      <P>While this is primarily a matter to be resolved between the insurer and the consultants, I am considering the issue in the context of health insurance legislation which will be laid before the House later this year.  I have also asked the review group, established by me, which is carrying out an examination on the strategic and operational capacity of the VHI in the context of the Single Market, to consider the problem as part of its remit.</P>
      <P>I have noted with interest the recommendation by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies to appoint an independent assessor with functions in relation to consultant fees.  I agree this proposal is worthy of consideration as one of a number of approaches to resolving or easing the real problem.  It will certainly be carefully considered in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recognise that he carries responsibility for this problem and that it is not adequate to refer it to a committee?  The Labour Party policy in the manifesto seems to <Col N="790" /> ensure that every decision to be made must first be referred to a committee. This is a problem and it is not adequate or acceptable to tell the general public who are paying the VHI premium to wait until legislation in the context of the Single Market is introduced.  That is not the issue.  What is at issue is a breakdown of the system, whereby consultants are taking advantage of a particular arrangement, charging what they like and people are forced to pay.  The Minister has a responsibility in this regard.  What is he doing about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Balance billing applies <Col N="791" /> only in the private sector.  The VHI will need to operate on the basis of the Single Market.  I am required to present legislation to this House to set the parameters for the operation of the Single Market and I will do that before the summer.  I have set up an advisory group to look at all the implications of the Single Market to ensure that the best possible arrangement to protect vital issues such as community rating, entry into cover and all the other benefits are preserved.</P>
      <P>I will also ask them to consider this matter.  Only 65 per cent of consultants participate in the scheme and accept the fees negotiated with the VHI.  I would like all consultants to participate in the scheme but I cannot put a gun to their heads.  The suggestions that we appoint an assessor to determine fees or that we exclude consultants who will not accept the set fee do not represent a solution.  I will evaluate the proposals in a calm way to see which is the best solution.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government, I extend our deepest sympathy to the bereaved and the community of Castletownbere on this most tragic of occurrences.  I am sure every Member of the House will join with me in a united expression of heartfelt concern.  I am travelling immediately this afternoon to Castletownbere to assess the <Col N="793" /> situation and convey my sympathy to the bereaved and express my solidarity with the local community.  This is not the first time that Castletownbere has suffered a tragedy.  This is the most recent horrific and traumatic tragedy.</P>
      <P>The deputy chief surveyor of the Department will accompany me and take full charge of the investigation.  I have already set this in motion by despatching a marine surveyor to the scene of the accident this morning.  The investigation will be carried out quickly.  It will be comprehensive and the outcome will be published at the first opportunity.  This matter will be handled with the utmost transparency and openness and every effort will be made to find out what happened.</P>
      <P>The cause of the accident has not yet been definitely established and I cannot pre-empt the findings of the inquiry.  The circumstances surrounding the sinking of the vessel within the harbour limits are still emerging but I can confirm that four bodies have been recovered.  One person may still be missing but there is a doubt about this.  There are four survivors.  The rescue operation was overseen by the harbour master of Castletownbere with the full involvement of the Department of the Marine emergency services, the rescue helicopter and the Valentia lifeboat. I thank all concerned in the rescue operation for their unstinting effort and commitment to the task.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies opposite for tabling questions to give me an opportunity to respond immediately on what is a serious, dreadful and horrific tragedy for the community of Castletownbere.  I will keep the House fully informed of developments.  I will be available to take questions on the Adjournment on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of next week.</P>

On behalf of my party I wish to be associated with his expression of sympathy to the families, friends and <Col N="794" /> the community.  As well as initiating an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding this tragedy, will the Minister as a matter of urgency have checks carried out on similar ferries, many of which are operating on the west coast, so that any defects can be rectified before there is a further tragedy?</P>

At this sensitive time I do not wish to ask too many political questions but does the Minister believe that the present licensing arrangements and inspection procedures are adequate for vessels such as this?  Perhaps he will address this question next week in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The licensing system is as adequate as humans can make it but I have no doubt that a full examination of the system might uncover defects of one sort or another.  However, my officials have produced a licensing system that is adequate for the type of vessel it applies to.</P>
      <P>I realise the Deputy wants to be sensitive at this time, but if there are political questions he wants to ask let him, please, do so.  My approach is one of openness and transparency.  I am not hiding behind anything when I say that it would be inappropriate to the owner of the vessel or to the bereaved to make any statement about the licensing or otherwise of the vessel.  A full investigation will reveal the facts.</P>

      <P>I would like to be <Col N="795" /> associated with the expressions of sympathy to the bereaved families and the local community.  I welcome the Minister's early intervention and his initiative in travelling to the area this afternoon. In the light of the need for such ferries to island communities, does the Minister agree that the lack of grants for ferry services to non-Gaeltacht islands causes difficulties for those who provide ferry services to such islands?  They do not have the grant-aid that Gaeltacht islands have and so would have more difficulty in purchasing equipment, etc.</P>

      <P>There is an even-handed approach in the application of safety standards, more particularly on the island of Ireland.  I will have a look at the question of grants because I realise that in the absence of grants people might take short cuts.  However, I cannot give any firm undertakings.</P>

      <P>We do not know the circumstances of this accident.  All we know is that the ferry was a short distance out when it attempted to return and that it then capsized.  My concern is with the fact that people have lost their lives. When I suggest that a quick review of the system should be undertaken, I am not necessarily confining myself to checks of the ferry.  The review should take in the loading procedures, restrictions on weight, loads, and how the cargo is lashed down.  I understand the truck that was on the ferry was carrying gravel which is a load that can shift very easily.  Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, undertake some kind of review of procedures at other ports and other piers from which ferries depart so that criteria are established quickly to avoid a similar tragedy in the future?</P>

      <P>On the question of grant aid, I stress that grant aid to people in non-Gaeltacht areas should be the same as that available to people in Gaeltacht areas.  Conditions at sea do not vary as between Irish speaking and non-Irish speaking islanders.  I hope the Minister will make progress in that regard.  Regulations exist on the transport of petrol, but do regulations exist in relation to other cargo and, if so, exactly what are they?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Deputy have a note of the regulations.  As to the first part of the Deputy's question, it would appear inappropriate in the circumstances because this accident happened within arm's length of land and, <Col N="797" /> happily, if that expression is not too insensitive in the circumstances, there were a number of boats in the area and that is why all the people on board did not die.  I understand that four people died &mdash; there may be one person missing &mdash; and that four people survived.  If Deputy Bradford would like to table a question relating to grant aid on another occasion I will be happy to answer it, but I am not certain that it is appropriate to the circumstances of this horror story.</P>

I come from a constituency where there are a number of ferries operating successfully to islands such as Tory Island and Aranmore Island and I am a regular user of such ferries as are other people in similar positions.</P>
      <P>Passengers travelling on such ferries in the future will probably be fearful and I would like the Minister to do everything possible to assuage their fears.  I listened with interest to my colleague, Deputy Bradford.  Both of the ferries referred to are providing an essential service for those living in exposed and remote parts of our country who are entitled to safe boats and safe passage on our seas.  A number of the owners of such ferries in County Donegal are in receipt of subsidies to enable them provide a regular and safe service for their passengers. Perhaps the Minister might consider providing such a subsidy to the owners of ferries in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we should send out a message that the majority of car ferries travelling to islands around the country are safe.  I do not know the exact type of vessel which was involved in the accident to which we are referring or if it would fit into the genus of car ferry.  It had a roll-on/roll-off facility, but I am not sure whether its physical make-up would conform with that of ordinary passenger vessels which operate in the Deputy's part of the country. I know from experience that the car ferries operating between Rossaveel and <Col N="798" /> the Aran Islands are very safe, as safe as mankind can make them.  Nevertheless, we should send out a message today that car ferries in the main are safe, but there are exceptions to every rule and, unfortunately, this accident was one of those exceptions.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced <Col N="876" /> in the shadow of a case challenging the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  As we do not know the grounds for that challenge yet, it is extremely difficult for us to judge the implications of the case.  That matter must be resolved if this legislation or any divorce legislation is to stand.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Ronan Keane once described the influence of the Constitution on family law as sometimes baneful, occasionally ambiguous, and rarely positive.  We have already seen the Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill.  The challenge to the consititutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 creates a further uncertainty and doubt.</P>
      <P>Surely this experience is enough to signal that we live with a Constitution that is outmoded and unable to reflect the needs of modern Irish society.  The Constitution was framed in the 1930s, at a time when public attitudes to the family were a world apart from those of today. Even in the past ten to 15 years there has been an extraordinary transformation in the Irish family.  We now have couples living together without any noticeable censure.  Single parents are a common feature &mdash; the idea of giving up one's baby if one is a young, single mother is the exception rather than the rule.  The Irish family is smaller, the birth rate has dropped, women are more likely to see themselves as workers as well as mothers.</P>
      <P>The rate of marital breakdown has increased enormously.  According to the 1986 census, approximately 37,000 people considered themselves separated. In the 1991 census, that figure increased to 55,000 approximately.  That is a most dramatic exposition of the change in the Irish family and it is time that our Consititution was modified and changed accordingly.  We cannot live for ever with a Constitution that is set in the narrow bigoted confines of the 1930s, nor can we continue to pretend that the non-availability of divorce here has protected us from the phenomenon of marital breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> I note this week that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform referred to possible changes in the Constitution at some future date.  However, yesterday at Question Time the Taoiseach appeared to contradict that idea.  I hope the Minister develops his approach.  We cannot allow progress to be continually stymied because of a failure to change our Constitution. Indeed, we do not know what lies in store in relation to this Bill or the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 arising out of the current case.</P>
    <P>One element in this Bill concerns me, namely, that it provides for maintenance for spouses in nullity cases where a decision is made in court that there never was a marriage.  Even the term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; is inappropriate although it is used in this legislation, presumably for want of a better word.</P>
    <P>Surely that sets a question mark over the rights of the so-called common law wife, where a woman cohabits with a man for years and has a family.  At present she is not entitled to maintenance nor will she be under this legislation.  What difference is there in effect between the two?  If there is no difference how can we favour one in legislation and not the other?  Does this not raise the spectre of a constitutional case?</P>
    <P>This is a complex Bill.  Some provisions in it need to be teased out and questions raised and I look forward to having an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the legal age for marriage has been raised.  I do not think anybody would object to that change, although there should be special arrangements to allow for exceptional circumstances regarding the three month wait.  The idea of waiting to get married is a good one and is one which reflects a trend in society where people are marrying at an older age.  However, this could prove to be a restriction on a traditional way of life from one group in our population, namely, travellers.  Travellers often marry very young and to impose an older age limit would require a cultural change in that community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> It is important to note what the Bill does not cover.  It is not divorce legislation but it highlights more than anything else how urgent the case is to publish divorce legislation and to put the case for divorce to our people.  While legal arrangements must be made, property rights established, maintenance decided upon and the nuts and bolts of ownership sorted out a fundamental question must be addressed also, namely, the provision for the children of a marriage that has broken down.  That cannot be addressed so much in legislation as in the provision we make for support services.  Often, when a couple are separating, they are absorbed in their feelings, but there is a growing understanding that it is vitally important that they take into account the feelings and emotional needs of their children.  This requires an approach different from the traditional avenue for separating couples that leads to the solicitor's door.  It requires greater emphasis on mediation, on conciliation as opposed to reconciliation and requires principles such as joint custody, where appropriate, to be established as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>The needs of children must be recognised as being of paramount importance. This can be achieved by facing up to the reality of marriage breakdown, by reducing the adversarial potential of divorce proceedings, encouraging mediation as a means to resolve difficulties and particularly by providing legal representation, where necessary, to protect the interests of children.</P>
    <P>The provision for dealing with pension rights is an important aspect of the Bill. Section 11 deals with the adjustment of pension rights after the granting of a decree of nullity.  Section 12 deals with pension rights after a judicial separation. It is worth noting that the splitting of pensions is only provided in nullity cases. I look forward to an opportunity to consider the Bill in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions that deal with gaps in the 1989 Act and particularly with anomalies in maintenance payments.  We all know how women in particular have suffered as a consequence of unscrupulous <Col N="879" /> men who have managed to evade their responsibilities.  However, if this Bill is to be significant, it must be followed up by divorce legislation.  If it is not, the provisions on nullity will have a negative effect on the resolution of marital breakdown.  Nullity should only be a recourse in a minority of appropriate cases.  However, as divorce is not available here there is a danger that nullity will become an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  I have no doubt that practice has developed because it reflects a provision for a resolution on marital breakdown that is allowed by the Catholic Church.  Surely we have moved on from that type of entanglement between Church and State.</P>
    <P>In the case of many marriages it is dishonest to say they never existed, even though nullity may provide a decision which allows partners to resolve their personal dilemma.  It is better to face up to the need for humane divorce legislation, an entitlement of many thousands of separated people who desire divorce. We cannot disregard the fact that we are debating the Bill in the shadow of a constitutional case.  We have seen the effect of a constitutional challenge on the Matrimonial Home Bill.  At that time the Minister made considerable efforts to avoid a constitutional case, but he acted on bad advice and, despite his efforts, the Bill fell and women lost out.</P>
    <P>On the needs of separated people, we cannot afford to lose because of bad advice or a failure to face up to the complexities of the issue.  The Constitution determines the legislation we can produce and that Constitution needs to be changed.  We are approaching the end of the 20th century, a time when the people's attitudes are changing and when the principles of equality and civil rights are being challenged by a Constitution drawn up in earlier times when other attitudes prevailed.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the support of all parties for this Bill.  He received the same support for the Matrimonial Home Bill and if divorce legislation is based on sound principles it will receive the <Col N="880" /> support of all parties.  I fear that unless constitutional questions are adequately answered, that support may not be enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on introducing this vital legislation to extend property, financial and other ancillary rights to spouses and children affected by marital breakdown, separation and nullity.  Part III introduces major reforms in cases of foreign divorces and nullities. There are great anomalities in this regard in our legal system and the Minister is to be commended for bringing forward proposals to deal with them.  This Bill strengthens legislation in respect of maintenance in the event of separation and nullity.  It breaks new ground in the area of family law.  The Minister, in his short time in this new important Department, has taken major steps to protect the institution of marriage, strengthen it and, in cases where there are difficulties, attempted to guide couples towards mediation where their problems could be discussed and, in some cases, resolved.</P>
      <P>In the budget, the Minister secured an allocation of an additional £750,000 for the voluntary marriage counselling service. He took a number of other steps also to mark the International Year of the family.  He secured an additional £300,000 for the family mediation service and proposes to extend the service throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Up to now the allocation for free civil legal aid was small.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform under this Minister is establishing for the first time a system of civil legal aid in this State. That is a remarkable development.  Many Deputies regularity meet couples experiencing difficulties in their relationships. Many cases dealt with in civil legal aid centres relate to family matters, marriage difficulties and so on.  The Minister has taken a position to strengthen the institution of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on securing a grant of £100,000 for the Coolock Community Law Centre for the current year. During the next six months it might be <Col N="881" /> possible to disentangle the civil legal aid functions of the centre from its social welfare functions.  Perhaps funding for the foreseeable future could be secured for the civil legal aid functions of the centre which deals with the problems addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> earlier this week in which a churchman for whom I have a great deal of time, Dr. Laurence Ryan, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, stated: &ldquo;There is something wrong in the political parties and those with extensive power over public opinion joining forces to condition people into accepting divorce as an unqualified social good&rdquo;.  The bishop asked that any legislation brought forward should make provision for tax rebates for mothers in the home, increase the legal age of marriage to 18 and provide for a minimum notice period of marriage. He criticised the subtle presentation by politicians and the national media of civil divorce as a major benefit to society.  I congratulate Dr. Ryan and other bishops for their great interest in unemployment and revitalising the economy, but Dr. Ryan is basically wrong on this issue.  It could be argued that his presentation in this article could not be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Politicians have to deal with the harsh realities of marriage breakdown and marriage difficulties.  A recent labour force survey gives the best picture of unemployment and the structure of families' working lives.  It estimates that 60,000 adults are directly affected by problems in the family law area.  Deputy McManus quoted earlier from the Civil Legal Aid Board's reports which point out that in the last three years there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of people using its service and looking for support in cases of nullity and separation.  Everybody must recognise that there are fundamental problems in this area which seem to be on the increase.  For the sake of dependent spouses and children, we must come to grips with these problems, that is precisely what the Government is doing in the Family Law Bill.  I hope that in the discussions in this area in the next <Col N="882" /> year or so we will deal with the realities of society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh spent a good deal of her time lambasting the Government about its attitude to the Matrimonial Home Bill which was regarded as unconstitutional. The Government acted in good faith in pursuing the ideal of equality of ownership in the family home. As the Minister explained in detail, the Family Law Bill and other measures which he intends to bring forward in the family law area leading up to the divorce referendum are in no way dependent on the Matrimonial Home Bill, which basically proposed to deal with ownership of the home within stable marriages.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with nullity.  Many of us hear about cases where people go to another jurisdiction, deserting their spouse and children.  Until now there was no means of redress for the dependent spouse and children in these circumstances. Under section 3 of the Bill it will be possible for the Circuit Family Court to make decisions to provide for maintenance for the dependent spouse. This will ensure that when a person runs away to another jurisdiction, their spouse and children will not be left in penury, totally dependent on a small State pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to the increase in the marriage age to 18 and the introduction of a three month cooling off period.  That provision is to be warmly welcomed.  She also referred to a section of the community with which I am very familiar and which also comes within the remit of the Department of Equality and Law Reform, the travelling community. The Government has proposed the setting up of a task force to deal with reform in this area.  Every effort will be made to encourage teenage travellers to finish secondary education.  In that regard the traditions referred to by Deputy McManus may be changing.  A major task of the Department of Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education is to educate young people in the social and health areas.  It is interesting that this Bill meets the point referred <Col N="883" /> to by Dr. Laurence Ryan in his recent comments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of measures which will make it easier for families to sort out their problems in the Circuit Family Court.  Under section 46 the court may request probation and welfare officers to submit reports and persons may come forward to testify on aspects of a relationship.</P>
    <P>The central objective of the Bill is to provide for dependent spouses and children. I have already referred to section 3 &mdash; the other main sections dealing with this issue are sections 5 to 23, inclusive, which propose to bring nullity into line with separation as it is provided for under the Judicial Separation Act, 1989. Section 5 which provides for interim maintenance orders is welcome.  It proposes that the court may make interim arrangemennts for dependent spouses and children.  Section 7 proposes new powers of attachment to secure payment under maintenance orders.  This is a major innovation which will ensure that spouses discharge their duties under existing legislation.  Sections 9 and 10 contain innovative provisions on financial compensation and property.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the life assurance provisions and pension adjustments. These improvements are particularly important in the case of marriages which have been annulled.  When a marriage is annulled it is deemed never to have existed.  This could place a dependent spouse with no resources in a very difficult position.  I welcome the provisions in section 7 which will alleviate some of the hardship for such spouses.  A similar approach has been taken in section 16 (2) (k).</P>
    <P>When marriages are annulled difficulties can arise in regard to succession rights.  Section 13 deals with orders extinguishing succession rights on judicial separation.  The Minister has made it very difficult for a non-dependent spouse to take away the rights enjoyed by the other spouse.  Section 16 (2) (g) refers to:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> the effect on the earning capacity of each of the spouses of the marital responsibilities assumed by each during the period when they lived together and, in particular, the degree to which the future earning capacity of a spouse is impaired by reason of that spouse having relinquished or foregone the opportunity of remunerative activity in order to look after the home or care for the family.</P>
    <P>This is a key provision in assessing the type of maintenance to be paid to a spouse and indicates that the basic theme of the Bill, the protection of the rights of dependent spouses, particularly women, is being carried through successfully.</P>
    <P>I referred to section 3 as it relates to foreign divorces.  The Minister is to be commended on bringing our legislation in this area into line with that of most of our European partners.  He has attempted to reform some of the legislation on maintenance to ensure that a dependent spouse cannot be left with very little resources.  We know from the Combat Poverty Agency reports that in cases where there are no attachment orders spouses can refuse to meet their commitments.  I welcome the attempts being made to strengthen the provisions in this area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation which attempts to deal with some of the major problems in the family law area.  I will refer in more detail to one or two aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The Minister's legislative programme leading up to the divorce referendum will tend to focus on the property rights of dependent spouses and the rights of children.  The Minister has taken a major step forward in this Bill in ensuring that the rights of spouses are protected in the future regardless of the circumstances of the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The large number of <Col N="885" /> fines and penalties being reduced by the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, is of genuine concern to the public, the Judiciary and legislators. Section 23 of that Act gives the Minister the power to remit sentences and penalties imposed by the courts.  Incidentally, the power of remission does not apply to a driving licence disqualification for drunk driving &mdash; this is excluded under section 19 of the 1968 Road Traffic Act.  At the time sentences for this offence could be remitted, section 23 (5) of the 1951 Act provided that the details of such remissions should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
      <P>It appears from statistics that there were 1,468 successful petitions between 1 January and 30 November last year and that during a recent two year period 8,500 petitions were successful.  Last year 4,050 petitions to the Minister were finalised, 98 qualified for full remission of fines, 1,080 qualified for partial reduction and extra time was allowed for the payment of fines in 600 cases.  The power to remit sentences is given under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.  It is worth noting that this power can also be used to allow for early releases from prison.  As we all know a common cause of early release from prison is lack of jail space.</P>
      <P>I am not so much objecting to the use of this power by the Minister but the manner in which it is used.  Until fairly recently this power was used in a much more sparing fashion and it was generally understood that it should be used only in exceptional cases and for good reasons. It was never envisaged that such a power should be used as a matter of routine, particularly if the person petitioning the Minister had not exhausted all the normal appeal procedures through the courts.  It had also been the practice, until fairly recently, to consult the judge who had imposed the fine or sentence.  The practice now seems to have developed where this power is being used with little or no consultation and petitions are routinely processed by civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure whereby the names and details of those successful petitioners were published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was <Col N="886" /> amended in 1961.  This is very important because if we had a transparent system where the names of petitioners and the outcome of petitions were published and there was accountability there would not be so much public outcry at the remission of sentences.  At present sentences handed down, including imprisonment, fines and penalties, are reduced or set aside without any transparency or accountability.  This undermines the entire criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>We recently debated legislation which provides for an appeals system for lenient sentences.</P>
    <P>What is the point in debating such legislation when the practice of undermining sentences legitimately handed down is taking place on a daily basis?  It should be remembered that when judges impose sentences they have already taken into account mitigating factors and in some cases have imposed minimum fines.  If the law is to have any credibility this practice of wanton reductions in sentences and penalties must be curbed and brought back to a reasonable level, a level which was based originally on flexibility in exeptional circumstances and on consultation.  To ensure we have transparency and ministerial accountability, the names of petitioners and the outcome of petitions must be published as before in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I do not understand why this is not being done.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we passed all Stages of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, radical legislation which introduces a whole panoply of new offences carrying fines.  Are we wasting our time putting in place such legislation if the Minister can executively remit those fines as a matter of routine?  Are we wasting our time picking our way through legislation, trying to get it right and putting in place fines so that people who do wrong can be punished only to have the whole process wiped out at the stroke of the Minister's pen?  I would welcome her response on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the coming into operation <Col N="887" /> of the Constitution on 29 December 1937 the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are vested in the President under the terms of Article 13.6 and 13.9 of the Constitution.  Article 13.6 also provides for such power, except in capital cases, to be conferred by law on other authorities. Pursuant to this, such power was conferred on the Minister for Justice under section 23 (3) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 and the delegated Authority of Government dated 30 March 1951. Accordingly, the Minister for Justice is empowered, except in capital cases, to commute or remit, in whole or in part, any punishment imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction, subject to such conditions as the Minister may think proper.  This power has been exercised by each and all of my predecessors.</P>
      <P>Any person convicted of an offence is entitled to petition and it is true that a large number of people in all walks of life do so.  The petition is sometimes lodged by the individual, a solicitor, a journalist or a public representative.  Deputies, in general, appear to appreciate and support the petitions procedure having regard to the number of petitions received from Members of this House on behalf of their constituents.  Mitigation may cover full remission of penalty, proposed partial mitigation of penalty and extension of time to pay.  I would stress that the number of petitioners who get away scot free under the petitions procedure is minimal and it is an outrage that Deputy O'Donnell should accuse me of wholesale undermining of sentences.  I reject that.  For example, of the 2,283 cases involving mitigation in 1993 only 98 obtained full remission of fines.  The remaining 2,185 petitioners had to pay the full fine in 604 cases or a reduced monetary penalty in 1,580 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that Members of this House from all political parties, including the Deputy's party, clearly appreciate and support the petitions system and use it.  The justification for the system lies in the simple fact that, for one reason or <Col N="888" /> another, the judge, when deciding the penalty to be imposed is not always made aware of circumstances which on any objective criterion would call for mitigation &mdash; more often than not these circumstances boil down to an inability, for family or other domestic reasons, to meet the full penalty.  Indeed circumstances can and do arise subsequent to a case which significantly reduce the offender's ability to meet the full penalty imposed. Appeal to a higher court would be beyond the resources of many of those who submit petitions and would be cumbersome and inefficient to operate by comparison with the more simple and straightforward expedient of bringing the penalty down to a level which more accurately reflects the offender's circumstances.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of this.  Some time ago a woman whose only income was a widow's pension and who had a large family was fined approximately £300 for non-payment of a television licence fee.  Is it fair to expect that woman on a mere widow's pension and with a large family to pay the full amount of the fine?  Would it be fair also to expect that woman to go to the huge expense of paying a solicitor and a barrister to take the case on appeal to a higher court?  The interest of justice is much better served by the petitions system.</P>
    <P>The average number of petitions received in recent years is approximately 4,300 per year, while the average number of cases in which mitigation is granted in one form or another is 2,400 or 56 per cent.  In the light of this I am sure the House will agree that the suggestion there has been an increase in the number of fines and penalties being reduced is unfounded.  I am confident that above all else this House will recognise that the proportion of cases in which mitigation involves total removal of the penalty is small and that it arises only where the case for it is beyond dispute.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate - Carlow Courthouse.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> On 10 <Col N="889" /> February I tabled the following question to the Minister for Justice: if, in view of the many steps at the entrance of the elevated Courthouse in Carlow, and in view of the renovations costing £400,000 going on at present the plans, if any, she has to install a lift in order to allow access for handicapped people.  The Minister stated in a written reply on 15 February that the estimate for this work was £274,000.  That is incorrect; the figure is in excess of £350,000.  She stated also that there were particular difficulties with the provision of access for the disabled to Carlow courthouse.  That is the nub of the whole matter.  Carlow has a beautiful courthouse with lovely pillars but it has 13 wide steps right across the front of the building which, unfortunately, make it impossible for a person in a wheelchair to gain access to the building.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago a person in a wheelchair had to be carried up the steps of the courthouse by four members of the Garda Síochána.  That is not good enough.  People may have thought this person was being arrested when in fact it was simply a matter of having no other way to get into the building.  The Minister stated in reply to my question that the cost of providing a lift would be £50,000. I have been given a figure of £20,000. The Minister went on to say she fully accepted that works beyond those required for maintenance are desirable and that in this courthouse, as in others, the provision of resources necessary to cater for the needs of the disabled deserves special attention.  It does not deserve special attention, it deserves special action and the only action that will help the disabled is for the Minister to allocate funding to provide a lift for this courthouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post office in the town has provided a ramp to cater for people in wheelchairs, which is commendable.  The least we would have expected following the Year of the Disabled was that people with disabilities would have access to all buildings, yet this courthouse, which people often attend following accidents, is inaccessible to those people, despite <Col N="890" /> the fact that over £350,000 is being spent on its refurbishment.  Although the repair of the courthouse may not be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, it is unfair that money is being spent renovating Carlow courthouse without any attempt being made to cater for people in wheelchairs or who have any form of disability.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that this work is not completed until the lift has been installed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware Carlow courthouse is the most dominant building in the town, having been constructed in 1830 by W. V. Morrison.  Unlike many courthouses built in the post-1830 era, Carlow is aesthetically pleasing on the outside but at the expense of the internal functionality.  However, while it is such an outstanding piece of architecture, it has not been given the care down the years that such a building deserves.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in reply 14 days ago to a Parliamentary Question I informed the House that Carlow County Council has submitted proposals for improvements to Carlow courthouse at an estimated minimum cost of £274,000. All of this is targeted at works which are deemed essential if the basis fabric of the courthouse is to be preserved.</P>
      <P>The first and most urgent task was to renovate the roof.  This work is ongoing at a cost of £107,500.  On completion of the roof consideration will be given to essential refurbishment works.</P>
      <P>There are particular difficulties with the provision of access for the disabled to Carlow courthouse.  The advice available to me &mdash; which I have to take &mdash; is that the provision of a special lift in Carlow may not be structurally possible but, if feasible, would cost in excess of £50,000.  Because of the very poor state of repair of many courthouses nationwide my first priority must be to provide for the basic works necessary to maintain the fabric of this and other courthouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that works beyond those required for maintenance of the fabric are desirable and that, in Carlow courthouse, as in others, the provision of <Col N="891" /> resources necessary to cater for the needs of the disabled are made in all new courthouse projects.  For example, a special ramp is being constructed at the new model school's courthouse project in Cork city and where feasible such special provisions are also included in all major refurbishment projects.</P>
    <P>As I said originally, my first priority, as Minister for Justice, must be to look after the basic fabric needs of the many courthouses nationwide in a very bad state of repair.</P>
    <P>I regret the news I have for Deputy Browne is not that he would desire.</P>

      <P>These last few weeks all of us will have witnessed the presence of members of the United Farmers Association protesting at the gates of Leinster House.  These men will have left their farms and families in the west and stood outside this House for a principle in which they firmly believe, that is their absolute refusal to submit an RSI or pension number of premium and sheep headage payments in excess of £500 per annum.  Though the closing date for the submission of these forms is Monday next, 28 February, a small minority only of UFA members have so far submitted completed application forms.  Failure to return the completed forms in time could well spell economic ruin and disaster for many small-time sheep farming families, primarily in the west, but particularly in County Donegal where there are well over 5,000 such families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the principle for which members of the UFA are fighting is a just <Col N="892" /> one in that none of them could survive on the meagre and minuscule income they derive from their farming activities.  Most of them are upholding a traditional way of life without any hope of gaining alternative employment in industry or other economic activity.  Requesting such a group, merely at subsistence level, to submit a tax number is an extremely daft proposal.  None of these people is objecting to paying their just taxes but none has a taxable income from farming and they simply perceive this latest proposal as another layer of bureaucratic red tape.</P>
    <P>At this eleventh hour, on behalf of all farmers in severely disadvantaged areas who are in the depths of uncertainty as to whether they should apply &mdash; and I hope they do apply &mdash; I would ask the Minister, as a first step, to extend the latest date for receipt of completed application forms by a week or two.  A precedent for doing so already exists.  I am not asking for anything new in that I understand that such submission dates were often extended heretofore.  Such extension would give us all breathing space in which to work out an acceptable solution to this problem, on which my colleague, Deputy Doyle will have a few constructive suggestions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best within the two minutes remaining to me to do justice to a very serious issue, one that affects mainly farmers below subsistence level in terms of farming alone, who are dependent on our social welfare system for existence and to remain on the land. We need them to remain as custodians of the land of Ireland.  I do not have to repeat the figures of the numbers migrating from the land in each generation; in 20 years there has been a 40 per cent decline in our rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could raise with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, the possibility of extending the PRSI exemption threshold to at least £2,300, £3,000, if possible per annum. I pick the figures of £2,300 per annum because that represents £7.50 a day, six <Col N="893" /> days a week, for 52 weeks of the year, the amount anyone on social welfare is allowed to earn without affecting their entitlement.</P>
    <P>I should like these farmers treated as everyone else is treated.  If the Minister would allow them that exemption threshold, effectively allowed others under the social welfare code, it would ensure equity.  For example, if a husband is receiving social welfare assistance for a wife and two children, the wife can earn up to £45 per week without affecting her husband's entitlement to social welfare for his family.  I should like the same principle applied to farmers who are dependent on income support from social welfare to remain on small farms, particularly in extremely disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Monday deadline faces us.  I ask the Minister to extend it, not to disqualify these farmers from headage payments because their applications will be submitted late.  They have not got PRSI numbers and they are nervous of getting into the system, fearing that it will affect their social welfare payments.  They feel there is a hidden agenda there.  If they could have assurances that they could earn in a year, from their sheep production, at least £2,300, which any other family on social welfare would be allowed to earn without affecting their social welfare payments, we could overcome the impasse prevailing.</P>
    <P>I must draw the Minister's attention to the urgency of this matter.  Attention must be directed to this problem today and tomorrow since next Monday is the deadline for the premium applications.  I would ask the Minister to devise a formula to allow the very people who need to remain on our land in the most remote areas to find a way around this problem, ensuring that their social welfare payments will not be affected in addition to allowing them to obtain the premiums to which they are entitled, up to £2,300.</P>
    <P>The resolution of this problem is in the Government's court.  All of us in this <Col N="894" /> House would agree that this sector of the community, disadvantaged by where they live, should be allowed to remain on the land in rural Ireland.  I would ask the Minister to help them.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for having brought this matter before the House which seems to be of particular importance in the Donegal area.  I met some people from Donegal this day week, at the request of Senator Seán Maloney.  Deputies Gallagher and Blaney have also made representations to me on the matter.  I welcome this opportunity to put the record straight.</P>
      <P>Following a number of representations from the main farming organisations it was decided to bring forward the application period under the ewe premium and sheep headage schemes this year. This earlier application period and its shorter duration will facilitate early lamb producers, allowing the more orderly disposal of cull ewes.  The 100-day retention period in the ewe premium scheme &mdash; which runs from the closing date &mdash; will end on 8 June 1994.  Since the retention period is determined by the closing date, any change in the closing date would have implications for the retention period.  In addition, now that the applications forms, terms and conditions are with the farmers the changing of the closing date would confuse matters.  I do not believe that it would be in the interests of farmers generally to extend the closing date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of tax clearance procedures for applicants under the disadvantaged <Col N="895" /> areas headage schemes following discussions between farm organisations and Government Ministers, it was agreed in March 1992 that RSI numbers would not be required for disadvantaged areas headage payments until the beginning of January 1994.</P>
    <P>From January 1994 farmers applying for disadvantaged areas headage payments which, in total, amount to between £500 and £5,000 must state the following on their applications form: the RSI number issued to them for tax purposes; the tax office dealing with their tax affairs and that to the best of their knowledge, their tax affairs are in order.  Farmers in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment and who, accordingly, have no tax liability will simply have to quote the RSI number associated with their means tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>In the rare event of applications for headage payments totalling £5,000 or more in any one calendar year, farmers are required to supply a tax clearance certificate from the Collector-General with their headage applications.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to all farmers in the disadvantaged areas in December last giving details of this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>Applications for disadvantaged areas headage payments to the value of between £500 and £5,000 cannot be processed without an RSI number.  Similarly applications for disadvantaged areas headage payments in excess of £5,000 cannot be processed without a tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>It is in farmers' interests to submit the required RSI and tax clearance details with their applications as this will speed up processing.  It is even more important, however, that farmers should submit their applications by the closing date of 28 February to avoid penalties.  For this reason all farmers should submit their applications by 28 February even if the <Col N="896" /> RSI number and tax clearance details have to be submitted later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  My question relates to the up-to-date position regarding the provision of additional accommodation and facilities at two vocational education committee schools, Inver College, Carrickmacross and Ard Scoil Lorgan, Castleblaney.  The Minister gave an allocation to the three second level schools in the county which was greatly appreciated.  However, it created extra pressure on the other two schools.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 350 pupils in Castleblaney and 500 pupils in Carrickmacross. Representations have been made since the early 1980s for major extensions to both schools.  Substantial expenditure had been incurred and the planning process was well advanced.  It now appears that they have to begin the planning process again.  From information ascertained through parliamentary questions and debate it seems that there is a lower expenditure <i>per capita</i> in Monaghan than in other counties.</P>
      <P>Prefabricated buildings have been provided. In Carrickmacross there are 14 prefabs.  In general, such buildings have a short lifespan and are unsuitable.  Policy in the Department should lean more towards permanent structures.  There is an increased demand for vocational education and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Castleblayney discussion centred on whether to develop the school further because it is sited on the edge of a national primary route or to build on a new site.  The junior metal room is urgently in need of replacement.  In the 1989-93 National Development Plan the North-Western sub-committee recommended that a second third level institution <Col N="897" /> related to training needs be provided in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  I hope this will become a reality.  There is a great tradition in furniture manufacturing, textiles, footwear and in the food industry and scope for the vocational school to conduct classes in those areas.</P>
    <P>The County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee has been extremely successful in availing of money under different headings, for example, the IFI.  There is a very good administrative and teaching structure with an active chief executive officer who is noted for his initiative and enterprise.  With very little funding he and his committee developed an outdoor educational centre.  It has proved a great facility for both primary and secondary schools and is heavily booked for day and residential accommodation until next August.  There are many bookings from Northern Ireland.  They have a running track at Beach Hill which is nearing completion but an additional £40,000 is required to complete it.  The entire project cost £160,000.  They established a business study group and adult education in a vacant health board premises.  They are innovative and enterprising.</P>
    <P>The Minister should facilitate the committee by allowing the two projects to commence.  I know she may not think it a great way of thanking her for the substantial funding we have received to ask for more now, but I urge her to ensure that the two schools get the additional facilities they urgently require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education I wish to thank Deputy Leonard for raising this important question relating to the provision of additional accommodation and facilities at two vocational schools in County Monaghan, namely, Inver College, Carrickmacross and Ard Scoil Lorgan, Castleblayney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to both these schools <Col N="898" /> is similar.  Architectural planning for an extension to each school was under way in the late 1980s.  However, at that time, in common with all major building proposals, it became necessary to review the project in the light of changing demographic trends throughout the country. The Deputy will appreciate that all building programmes need to be critically examined to ensure that the need for the proposed buildings is fully justified by long term projections of pupil numbers. This is particularly important in centres where two or more post-primary schools are in operation.</P>
    <P>In the cases of Carrickmacross and Castleblayney, lengthy discussions took place between officials of the planning building unit of the Department of Education and the local authorities on the question of rationalisation of facilities at both centres.  Despite protracted negotiations, no agreement was reached at local level and it is accepted that rationalisation is not an option which can be pursued at present.  In view of this, the question of additional accommodation for Inver College and Ard Scoil Lorgan is being examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In the case of Inver College, Carrickmacross an educational worksheet has been completed by the school authorities. An overall schedule of future accommodation needs of the school was discussed at a meeting this week between officials from the Department of Education and County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee.  This is to be followed up immediately by a visit to the site by a senior inspector and a senior architect from the Department's planning and building unit to assess the existing accommodation and decide any additional accommodation needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Discussions also took place at the meeting this week on the accommodation requirements of Ard Scoil Lorgan, Castleblayney.  Again, a schedule of accommodation for the school will be <Col N="899" /> prepared taking into account the existing buildings and the need for additional accommodation, in particular specialist rooms for junior metalwork and construction studies.</P>
    <P>When accommodation requirements have been agreed with County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee, <Col N="900" /> it is hoped to commence architectural planning in both instances.  The question of proceeding to construction will depend on the availability of capital funding when the planning process is complete.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 March 1994.</P>

Should a patient feel that their condition has deteriorated, they should contact their general practitioner who would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant directly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 26, 34 and 74 together.  Vaccination against <Col N="801" /> hepatitis B is used in Ireland in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation on vaccination and immunisation.  In this context, individual countries decide to introduce hepatitis B vaccination, having regard to the epidemiology of the disease.  In common with a number of northern European countries in which the incidence of hepatitis B is low, the Department of Health has not introduced a population based vaccination programme against hepatitis B but has decided that the vaccine is made available to groups considered to be at particular risk of contracting the disease.  These include certain health care personnel.  I am not therefore considering the extension of the programme at present to include children but my Department is keeping the matter under review in the context of the epidemiology of the disease here.  The vaccine is also available to organisations such as Dublin Bus in respect of its employees, if they consider it necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy is not available because the Adoption Board does not distinguish between handicapped and other children in its annual analysis of adoption orders made by it.  Inquiries made from the health boards indicate that the boards were involved in arranging the adoption of some 40 handicapped children during the past ten years.  This includes 19 children placed by the Southern Health Board and 13 placed by the Eastern Health Board.  No information is available <Col N="802" /> as to the number of handicapped children placed for adoption by the voluntary adoption societies or adopted within the extended family.</P>
      <P>The policy of the health boards is to seek adoptive families for all children in their care whose parents have consented to their placement for adoption.  It is the practice for a health board social worker carrying out an adoption assessment to discuss with the prospective adoptive parents the area of handicap and to explore their attitude to it.  This is done as a matter of routine in all cases and helps to identify couples who may be willing to adopt children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The small number of handicapped children in the care of health boards who are actually available for adoption would not justify the establishment of the type of regional project group suggested by the Deputy.  I will, however, give sympathetic consideration to any request from the health boards for funding for specific initiatives aimed at further developing the availability of family placement services for children with special needs.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 21, 37 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in perinatal mortality during the last 30 years represents a considerable achievement for this country. The rate is now only a quarter of what it was in 1960 and less than half the level for 1975.  The most recent finalised figures refer to 1990 and show a perinatal mortality <Col N="803" /> rate for Ireland of 10.2 deaths per 1,000 live and still births.</P>
    <P>In comparison with our EU partners, Ireland's perinatal mortality rate is marginally above average.  The most recent average figure refers to 1988 and gives a rate of 9.3 deaths per 1,000 live and still births.  The interpretation of these comparisons can, however, be quite difficult given differences in the definition of a still birth between countries, and, more importantly, differences in national policies on abortion.</P>
    <P>Perinatal mortality rates are affected by a wide range of environmental and biological factors.  Birthweight, mother's age, type of antenatal and maternity care as well as many other variables have a bearing on perintal risk.  The goal is to sustain the progress we have made over the last three decades in reducing these risks to a minimum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 25 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcohol related problems make a heavy demand on our psychiatric services. Traditionally those suffering from alcohol related problems have been treated in our psychiatric hospitals.  This approach often involves costly in-patient <Col N="804" /> care which tends to separate the treatment and management of alcohol related problems from the environment in which they occur.</P>
    <P>However, the report of a study group on the development of the psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future</i> published in 1984 recommended that the emphasis in management of alcohol related problems should be on community based intervention rather than on specialist in-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>Detoxification facilities for persons who have consumed excessive amounts of alcohol have until recent years been located either in the controlled environment of psychiatric hospitals or in general hospitals.  Alternative detoxification centres are currently being developed for use by persons who, following medical assessment, are deemed suitable for detoxification in a community setting such as a day hospital.  There would, however, continue to be a need for detoxification facilities in hospitals and a small number of residential places for people who, for social reasons, cannot benefit from day programmes.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of <i>Planning for the Future</i> on alcohol related problems were endorsed in the Green Paper on Mental Health published by my Department in 1992.  With the shift in emphasis towards out-patient treatment and counselling, it proposed that consultant psychiatrists would spend more time in training other members of the inter-disciplinary teams and in counselling and advising members of the primary care services.  It noted that the role of the specialist service should be to support the general practitioner in resolving alcoholrelated problems in the context of the health of the individual and family as a whole.  It also envisaged an important role for nurses and social workers.</P>
    <P>In line with this approach, comprehensive community-based alcohol treatment programmes are being promoted. Health boards which have not already developed local alcohol treatment services are being encouraged to do so and to consider ways in which services provided by voluntary and private organisations <Col N="805" /> can be integrated with health board services.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the emphasis in regard to alcohol related problems should be on their prevention.  This is a key element in the formulation of a national alcohol policy being developed by my Department's health promotion unit wherein the broader economic, social, educational, cultural and health factors which impinge on alcohol use and misuse are addressed. Work on the development of this policy document is at an advanced stage and I expect to have the final draft before me shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 141 to 143, inclusive, and 145 together.</P>
      <P>I have received correspondence from the spinal injuries action association concerning medical cards for persons with spinal injury and requesting that spinal injuries be included as a condition which would qualify under the long term illness scheme.  I will deal first with the question of medical cards.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  Assessment is based on gross income less PRSI deductions.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the chief executive officers have introduced a number of measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment.  Weekly payments made under the FÁS social employment scheme are excluded in assessing income. Persons who held a medical card while <Col N="807" /> on the live register are allowed retain the medical card for a period of two years after taking up employment, if they qualify for family income supplement.  There are also special provisions for people participating in certain other schemes targeted at the long term unemployed, for example, disabled persons participating in the employment support scheme also retain their medical card for two years.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that it is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>The long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of these particular illnesses.  I have no plans to extend the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the extent to which the needs of people with exceptional medical expenses are met by other schemes.</P>
    <P>The long term illness scheme is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions. Any person who does not have a medical card, and who has an ongoing medical condition which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.  Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the Health board.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council published the fourth <Col N="809" /> edition of its <i>Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour and to Fitness to Practice</i> last month.  In so doing, the council was exercising its statutory powers to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  The council regards the guide as an aid by which individual members of the profession may judge particular situations.  The guide does not, therefore, have the force of a decision of the council.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the section of the council's guide to which the Deputy refers does not make specific reference to HIV infection.  It deals with the risks that may attach to treating cases of communicable diseases generally.  The relevant section also advises that the patient must be referred to an appropriate colleague if a doctor does not wish to participate in the patient's management due to the risk factor.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere, the guide advises that where doctors wish to withdraw their services, they must inform the patient and allow sufficient time for alternative medical care to be sought, during which time clinical continuity must be maintained.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 32, 75 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the Eastern Health Board is the only health board which is providing a structured methadone maintenance programme. This programme was introduced <Col N="810" /> in accordance with the Government's strategies on HIV-AIDs and drugs.  It is designed to treat drug users in a controlled environmental, for heroin-abuse.  The service filled a need in the Eastern Health Board area because of the need to cater for the intravenous drug using population in its area.  The Eastern Health Board also run an extensive needle exchange programme which has been successful in changing needle-sharing habits among drug abusers, thereby reducing the risk of spreading HIV.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the methadone maintenance programme is a vital part of the HIV-AIDS strategy because it seeks to control the behaviour of the chaotic drug abuser and thereby restrict the spread of the HIV virus.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the review of child care and family support services prepared by the Mid-Western Health Board under section 8 of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The report actually indicates that there was a ten-fold increase in the number of confirmed cases of child abuse in North Tipperary and East Limerick during the period in question, up from 14 in 1989 to 150 in 1992.  There was a threefold increase in the number of reported cases during the same period, from 58 to 181.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be noted that the most significant increase in both cases reported and cases confirmed were in the categories of physical abuse and neglect. These forms of abuse accounted for more than half the increase in the total number <Col N="811" /> of confirmed cases between 1991 and 1992.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that among the factors which have contributed to these increases are: the increased public awareness in recent years of the problem of child abuse and the heightening of the vigilance of health care professionals, the appointment in 1992 of two community based child care workers in Limerick city and North Tipperary has resulted in a significant increase in the reporting of cases, the establishment in 1992 of a locally-based child abuse assessment service in the area has also contributed significantly to the number of cases confirmed and a series of training workshops for community care nursing and social work staff early in 1992 has led to improved liaison between the two disciplines and a subsequent increase in reported and referred cases of abuse.</P>
    <P>The report makes a number of recommendations for improving the health board's child protection services.  These recommendations are being pursued by the board in the context of its overall programme for developing child care and family support services in accordance with the requirements of the Child Care Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 38, 46, 55, 83, 91, 96 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>As set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Waiting List Initiative, which I launched in May of last year, was targeted specifically at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times were causing the greatest hardships.  These included:&mdash; Orthopaedics (hip replacement and other); Ophthalmology (cataracts and others); Ear, Nose and Throat; Cardiac Surgery (by-pass operation); Vascular Surgery (varicose veins) and Plastic Surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> At the time, I also voiced my concern about lengthening waiting times in:&mdash; General Surgery (including gynaecology and urology).</P>
    <P>The overall aim was to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months for adults in these particular specialities and to set a maximum period of 6 months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  Under the Initiative, my Department entered into agreements with health boards and voluntary hospitals throughout the country for additional 17,254 procedures to be completed by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>Two agencies were unable to meet their agreed targets and their allocations under the Waiting List Initiative 1993 were adjusted accordingly.  The Midland Health Board's allocation was reduced by £50,000 and the allocation to Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin was reduced by £78,000.</P>
    <P>In framing the original allocation of Waiting List Funds for the Eastern Health Board, a provision of £500,000 was included in anticipation of a seasonal requirement to transfer long stay patients occupying acute beds to more appropriate accommodation.  In the event, approximately £250,000 of this provision was required in 1993.  The remaining £250,000 became available for re-allocation to other agencies to enable additional waiting list procedures to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital in Cork planned some capital works associated with the Waiting List Initiative but subsequently did not proceed with this work and £120,000 of its allocation was re-directed.</P>
    <P>Under the Initiative, the Western Health Board was allocated a sum of £2,242,600 to perform an additional 1,884 procedures.  Of the 1,884 procedures contracted for, 600 were to be carried out in plastic surgery.</P>
    <P>Due to difficulties in recruiting staff for plastic surgery, the Board advised my Department it would not be able to meet its target of 600 procedures.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the Board would increase its activity in other areas where capacity allowed and, therefore, the <Col N="814" /> question of withdrawal of funds did not arise.  I am glad to report that the Western Health Board surpassed its overall target of 1,884 procedures and performed a total of 2,111 additional procedures under the Initiative.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with various agencies throughout the country which were in a position to carry out further additional procedures, the following agencies had their original allocations increased: the Mid-Western Health Board; the North-Western Health Board; the South-Eastern Health Board; the Western Health Board; Beaumont Hospital; the Coombe Hospital; the Mater Hospital; the Meath Hospital; the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; the Rotunda Hospital; the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital; St. James's Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital.</P>
    <P>As a result of the extra agreements entered into, my Department revised upwards the number of additional procedures contracted for under the Initiative from 17,254 to 18,293.  I am pleased to report to the House that the revised target was exceeded.  The overall number of additional procedures performed in 1993 was 18,768.</P>
    <P>Under the Initiative, the North-Eastern Health Board was allocated a sum of £671,750 to perform an additional 237 orthopaedic procedures, including 82 hip replacement operations.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated in my reply on 16 December, 1993 (P.Q. No. 14, Ref. Vol. 437 No. 4), my Department does not collect information on the average cost of specific operations on a routine basis.</P>
    <P>Negotiations with the North-Eastern Health Board and each agency involved in the Initiative, took into account various factors such as staffing, accommodation, equipment and other infrastructure requirements.  The Deputy will appreciate that the marginal cost of an additional procedure is influenced by these factors and, as such will vary from one agency to another.</P>
    <P>The information requested regarding <Col N="815" /> the number of medical personnel taken on by health boards and voluntary hospitals under the Initiative and the numbers of such staff since let go is not available within my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in order to achieve the increased level of activity under the Initiative, agencies were allowed flexibility to employ additional temporary staff as required for the purposes of the Initiative.  The level of personnel employed in this way varied from agency to agency and within agencies themselves depending on the arrangements necessary to achieve additional procedures and the availability of other infrastructural resources.</P>
    <P>Information regarding overtime payments made to medical personnel under the Initiative is not available within my Department.</P>
    <P>In June 1993, there was 40,130 people awaiting admission to acute hospitals nationally.  At the end of December 1993, this figure had been reduced by 14,757 to 25,373, a reduction of 37 per cent.</P>
    <P>The large reduction in numbers waiting has been brought about following the success of the Government's Initiative during the latter half of 1993.</P>
    <P>At the launch of the Initiative 14,624 adults and children had been waiting for periods in excess of 12 months for adults and 6 months for children in the problem specialties.  This figure has been reduced by 8,384 to 6,240, a reduction of 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to build on the success of the 1993 Initiative.  The continuation of the Initiative in 1994 with the special allocation of £10 million announced in the budget will enable further inroads to be made in problem areas.</P>
    <P>The principal objective will continue to be the elimination of waiting times in excess of 12 months for adults in the problem specialties and 6 months for children in ENT and Ophthalmology.</P>
    <P>A detailed review is underway on the experience gained during 1993 and the Department will be discussing with the health agencies in the coming weeks the <Col N="816" /> arrangements to be put in place during 1994 to further reduce waiting times.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102, 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>This drug has been available in Ireland since 1979.  It is a prescription-only medicine and its use is therefore subject to medical supervision.  It is recommended for short term use only.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed in the past regarding halcion.  Following the publicity in 1991 regarding this drug the National Drugs Advisory Board carried out a special review of the situation but it did not conclude that the product should be withdrawn.  The board continues to maintain ongoing monitoring of this drug and, indeed, of all benzodiazepine drugs of this class on the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European Communities, which includes representatives from the National Drugs Advisory Board, also examined the position in 1991.  The report of that examination did not indicate that the drug should be withdrawn, but stressed the appropriate safeguard measures including the setting of maximum dosage levels, precise indications <Col N="817" /> for prescribing and the importance of short term usage.</P>
    <P>In the light of the opinions of both the National Drugs Advisory Board, and the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, I do not propose to take any action modifying the current authorisation for this product.</P>
    <P>However, I would stress that this drug is intended for short term use only.  In accordance with the advice of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, it should not be used for more than ten days and treatment thereafter requires a complete re-evaluation of therapy. Patients in any doubt should consult with their medical practitioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict what the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments will be at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of a more appropriate bed.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to the accident and emergency departments is exacerbated at times through, for instance, major accidents or epidemics such as influenza.  Some of these departments, particularly in Dublin, have experienced difficulties from time to time because of the number of elderly people requiring attention.  The difficulty here has not primarily been the provision of acute hospital beds but of insufficient step-down <Col N="819" /> facilities for patients in need of a lower level of care.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem of this type.  In December 1993, following further discussions, I allocated an additional £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the accident and emergency hospitals to be eased.  This was achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six major A &amp; E hospitals in Dublin, who were no longer in need of acute hospital care, in step-down accommodation more appropriate to their condition. This action helped significantly to relieve the seasonal pressures on the hospitals.  This improvement is estimated to cost an additional £800,000 during 1994.</P>
    <P>The change which I have recently announced in relation to the charge for attendance at Accident and Emergency Departments is intended to create an incentive for patients to attend their General Practitioner in the first instance, in cases where their condition would be most appropriately treated at this level. I am hopeful that this change will help to ease the pressure on hospital Accident and Emergency Departments.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputies of my continuing concern that the Accident and Emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital was opened in November 1987 as a 600 bed hospital. This has increased to 615 at present.  The approved number of beds in Beaumont Hospital has not been reduced to allow nursing or other personnel to be accommodated and the hospital's full approved complement of 615 beds is in use for patient care.  There has been no reduction in the availability of beds for Accident and Emergency admissions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> A revised system of bed allocation has recently been introduced at Beaumont Hospital, in order to improve efficiency and to keep any delay to a minimum. I understand that this has considerably reduced the time for which patients from the Accident and Emergency Department must wait before obtaining beds.</P>

      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to the health boards on investment by general practitioners of savings achieved under the Drug Target Scheme.  The guidelines include three essential requirements which must be met in order to allow investments to be made:</P>
      <P>&mdash;savings are for investment in general practice developments;</P>
      <P>&mdash;developments, in order to qualify for investments under the scheme, require the approval of the local health board; and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Practice developments which may be supported under the scheme include investment in information technology, practice premises, clinical equipment, recruitment of primary care expertise on fixed term contracts, research, education and training.  Under the guidelines priority will be given to investing in improving organisational arrangements in general practice particularly where a number of general practitioners achieve savings in the same geographic area.  This will facilitate the development of amalgamations, groups and co-operative type arrangements between general practitioners so <Col N="821" /> that patients have easier access to a wider range of general practitioner services.</P>

      <P>I have been concerned for some time at the escalating cost of providing medical indemnity.  It was the main reason for the establishment of the Interdepartmental Working Group which is examining the whole area of medical indemnity.  The group has completed the first phase of its remit and has submitted its interim report to me.</P>
      <P>A revised medical indemnity scheme has been introduced for non-consultant hospital doctors, dentists and community doctors as a consequence of the first phase of the group's work.</P>
      <P>The group is now proceeding with the second phase of its remit which will include an examination of possible long term alternative systems of providing indemnity and of compensating patients who are victims of medical accidents.  I intend to await the outcome of the group's final report before deciding on any particular course of action.</P>

      <P>I wrote to the Deputy on 8 February last, indicating that this patient was on the out-patient orthopaedic waiting list for Merlin Park Regional Hospital and that the Western Health Board had indicated that it would be approximately 12 months before she would be called for assessment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of appointments for assessment at out-patient clinics is a matter for the consultant concerned, and urgent cases are always accorded priority. Should this patient be concerned about her condition, she should return to her general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>Last year I was pleased to have been in a position to allocate funds under the waiting list initiative for the equipping and commissioning of the two new clean-air theatres at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  In addition, while provision was made for the carrying out of an additional 160 orthopaedic procedures at the hospital, this target was exceeded and a total of 200 additional procedures were performed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that an additional sum of £400,000 has been included in the Western Health Board's 1994 revenue allocation for the further expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Hospital.  These developments should help to reduce the average waiting time for orthopaedic patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 67, 76 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for a number of income support schemes for disabled people which are administered by the health boards.  These are as follows: Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance; Disabled Person's Rehabilitation Allowance; Domiciliary Care Allowance; Mobility Allowance; Motorised Transport Grant and Blind Welfare Allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves.  The rate of disabled person's maintenance allowance at <Col N="826" /> £59.20 is equal to long term unemployment benefit and is in fact in excess of disability benefit.  In addition, recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance may also be entitled to other secondary benefits such as a medical card, free travel, free electricity allowance, free television allowance, telephone rental allowance, free fuel and butter vouchers.  A total of 28,759 people were in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance in 1992 and the 1994 cost of this scheme is estimated at £88.266 million.</P>
    <P>The extra costs associated with disability are met in a variety of ways, that is mobility allowance, long term illness scheme, drugs subsidy and refund schemes, provision of technical aids and appliances, tax reliefs and housing grants.  In addition, people with disabilities may avail of other support services such as home helps, day and respite care and vocational training services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 90 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> The term &ldquo;time out&rdquo; describes a practice of leaving persons on their own in a separate room.  The purpose of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; is to remove an individual from a situation in which they might injure either themselves or others and to allow them to regain their composure.  It is usually prescribed for brief periods only and the person involved is under supervision at all times, e.g. by video or through visual and/or oral communication.</P>
    <P>The practice is usually only used when other methods of intervention have failed; for example the offer of food or a drink, supervised activity elsewhere such as going for a walk, etc.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Time out&rdquo; should be employed only when acceptable guidelines are in place and should be part of a structured and professionally supervised programme of care.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons with a mental illness such guidelines are laid down in regulations under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  There are no general guidelines concerning the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; in the mental handicap services.  However, the evidence available suggests that &ldquo;time out&rdquo; is only rarely used in these services.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each health board to decide on the provision of home help. A person, whose elderly relative needs home help, should contact his or her local health board to discuss the services the board can provide to support the dependent person at home.</P>

      <P>The appointment of childcare or special needs assistants to schools is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and there is no specific provision in the Child Care Act for health Boards to make such appointments.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the Special Education Review Committee recommended that additional special needs assistant posts funded by the Department of Education should be created in both special and ordinary schools.  Specific appointment ratios for special needs assistants were recommended in the report for 12 categories of children with special needs. I am pleased to say that an additional 50 childcare assistants posts have recently been sanctioned by the Minister for Education. I understand that these posts will be allocated to selected schools from September 1994.</P>

      <P>Specialist investigation and treatment services for persons who have been sexually assaulted or raped &mdash; both male and female &mdash; are available at the Sexual Assault Treatment Unit, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin.  The unit provides facilities for the effective collection and processing of forensic evidence and a structured environment for the examination and treatment of victims of sexual assault and rape.  This service is designed primarily to meet the needs of the population within the functional area of the Eastern Health Board but is also available to persons resident in other health board areas.  Victims of sexual assault and rape outside the Eastern Health Board would also have access to local general practitioner-general hospital services for medical examination and treatment.</P>
      <P>Following medical assessment and treatment in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault and rape, victims are referred to support services, both statutory and voluntary, for on-going counselling and support to deal with the trauma of the assault.  Multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals in each health board area provide psychological support services for victims.</P>
      <P>The Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country provide valuable support and counselling to victims of rape and sexual abuse, both male and female.  Rape crisis centres are currently located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Waterford, Galway and Tralee and new centres are planned in Castlebar and Wexford in 1994.  All these centres receive or will receive funding from the health services Vote.  Services provided by each centre focus predominantly on counselling, both by telephone and on a face-to-face basis, to victims of recent and past rape attacks and to victims of child sex abuse, both male and female.</P>

The report is at present being considered by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  Pending such consideration by the board and subject to any advice which it may issue in the light thereof, I do not propose to take any action at this time on the matter.</P>
      <P>I would, however, stress that this drug is subject to prescription control and is only used under the guidance of a medical practitioner.  The particular complications which are reported to have arisen and which are the subject of the report in the <i>Lancet,</i> have occurred only in cases of overdoses of the drug and not where normal usage took place. Obviously, whilst wishing to minimise the possible effects of any overdose of medicines, I would stress that all medicines should only be used as prescribed by one's medical practitioner.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in November last, I launched the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service and announced a major programme to develop the country's ambulance service. The review group produced a very comprehensive list of recommendations covering all aspects of the service, including pre-hospital cardiac care.  These recommendations provide the basis of Government policy for the development of the ambulance service.</P>

    <P>At the launching of the report I stated that I intended to provide funds for the implementation of the recommendations of the report over the next five years.  As the first step, £500,000 was immediately made available to health boards for the development of ambulance services and was targeted at improving ambulance infrastructure.  As part of this process, £75,000 was made available to the Southern Health Board for improvements to equipment, communications and staff facilities.  The Deputy will be interested to learn that the Southern Health Board has had in place a programme for the development of its cardiac ambulance service since November 1992.  To date the board has equipped 18 of its emergency <Col N="837" /> ambulances with defibrillators and it is planned to equip the remaining seven ambulances in March 1994.

      <P>The job-sharing scheme for the health service was introduced in 1985.  The terms of the scheme provide that the operation and maintenance of job-sharing arrangements are a matter for the management of each agency and must necessarily depend on the demands of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent annual Health Services Personnel Census carried out by my Department shows that there were 2,526 nurses employed throughout the health service in a job-sharing capacity at 31 December 1992.  This represents nearly 9 per cent of the total nurses employed. The position in the voluntary hospital sector reflects the overall position for the <Col N="840" /> health service with 678 or 8.5 per cent of nurses in that sector employed in a job-sharing capacity.  The increasing success of the scheme in providing both an attractive alternative to full-time working arrangements and greater employment opportunities for nurses can be gauged from the following figures which show the annual increase in the total number of nurses availing of the scheme for the period December 1989 to December 1992.</P>

    <P>I am committed to encourage health agencies to allow the scheme to be used to the fullest extent possible.  I recently wrote to the chief executive officers of the health boards exhorting them to adopt as flexible an approach as possible in relation to accommodating staff wishing to avail of the scheme.  Within the context of overall personnel policy for the health services for 1994, details of which will be circulated to health agencies soon, it is my intention to emphasise the positive aspects of the job-sharing scheme and to ask each health agency to make every effort to ensure that the opportunities for greater participation in the scheme that exist are fully exploited.</P>

      <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his-her spouse.</P>
      <P>I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  Some of these are more favourable to disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of disabled people living at home with their parents where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  In contrast, the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I am, however, concerned that assessment of spouse's earnings is less favourable under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.  My Department is examining the cost implications of bringing the method of assessing spouse's earnings under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme into line with arrangements that apply to social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

    <P>(P) Provisional and likely to be revised.</P>
    <P>(¹) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are to some extent estimated.  The figures shown in the table are the tax paid by full-time farmers together with estimated tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>(²) The yield in 1991 from farmers was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992. Ordinarily these balances would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the current year basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990. The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>(³) Budget estimate.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the table do not include the PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1990-91, the latest available, indicates that some £33 million <Col N="843" /> in tax was paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
    <P>In common with all self-employed taxpayers, the income base on which farmers' income tax liability is reckoned is the gross income from all sources before adjustments are made in respect of capital allowances, qualifying deductible expenditure and personal allowances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>The latest year for which income distribution information on farmers is available is the income tax year 1990-91.  The gross income of full-time farmers who were assessed to tax for 1990-91 was £564 million.</P>
    <P>The corresponding income of trader-farmers who were assessed to tax for the same year was £219 million.  This amount includes income from trades and professions other than farming and is not distinguished in the total.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.  The report of the advisory group on prison deaths was published in August 1991.  The recommendations of the group form the basis of a prevention strategy in the prisons. So far some 50 of the 57 recommendations have been implemented or are in the course of being implemented including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;24 hour a day medical orderly cover in the closed institutions (at a cost of £500,000);</P>
      <P>&mdash;an increase in the number of clinical psychologists &mdash; from three to six initially &mdash; including a female psychologist to cover the women's prison;</P>
      <P>&mdash;installation of cell call systems with which distressed prisoners may summon help;</P>
      <P>&mdash;introduction of a service by the Samaritans in all institutions and availability of cordless telephones to enable prisoners to contact the Samaritans on dedicated telephone lines;</P>
      <P>&mdash;special training courses for prison staff;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the establishment of a suicide prevention group in each institution to review suicide attempts, and ensure appropriate action is taken, at local level;</P>
      <P>&mdash;training with resuscitation equipment;</P>
      <P>&mdash;employment of a pharmacist;</P>
      <P>&mdash;revision of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947;</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvements in GP services;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" />&mdash;provision of in-cell sanitation (a seven-year programme).</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations are more long term in nature, a fact which was acknowledged by the advisory group. They include the provision of a committal assessment centre and a new female prison.  These recommendations will be implemented in the context of the overall development of the prison system.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in implementing the report and that all reasonable steps are being taken to prevent suicides in the prisons.  As you will appreciate, however, given the complexity of the phenomenon, there is no guarantee that all suicides can be prevented.  The group itself acknowledged as much when it said &ldquo;if a person is sufficiently determined to commit suicide it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent him doing so&rdquo;.  The group made the further point that &ldquo;whereas many people who commit suicide in prison are or have been regarded as at risk, suicides occur among inmates in respect of whom there is no indication whatsover that they are at risk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There were two deaths in custody in Irish prisons and places of detention in 1993.  The comparative figures for deaths in custody for the previous five years are as follows:</P>

    <P>Not all these deaths were suicides &mdash; a proportion were drug overdoses which may well have been accidental and one death &mdash; in 1992 &mdash; was attributed to natural causes.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained in the prison system on suicide attempts.  This is because many instances of self injury by prisoners occur which are difficult to distinguish from deliberate serious suicide attempts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> There is anecdotal evidence to show that there has been a decline in the number of serious suicide attempts by prisoners since the inception of the suicide prevention programme in 1991.  To put the death in custody figures in context it should be noted that more than 6,000 prisoners go through the prison system every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of in-cell sanitation facilities throughout Mountjoy prison would be undertaken as part of a comprehensive refurbishment programme, involving extensive internal reconstruction and major upgrading of services, safety and security features.  The work would be tailored to meet the particular needs in individual sectors of the prison with the objective of providing vastly improved physical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, the element of cost specifically associated with the provision of in-cell sanitation facilities cannot readily be isolated and quantified. In addition, the number of cell spaces available following the refurbishment work would depend on how exactly the sanitation facilities will be provided in each wing of the prison.  I should add that while the refurbishment of an area of one wing to accommodate newly committed prisoners has commenced, it could not be taken as a basis for estimating the <Col N="848" /> position in relation to costs and cell spaces for the overall prison.  I expect to be in a position to give the Deputy the information he requires &mdash; or at least some very good estimates &mdash; when the work is more advanced.  A very rough estimate of the cost of the in-cell sanitation element &mdash; and I stress that is no more than a rough estimate at this stage &mdash; is £3.5 million.</P>

      <P>The PESCA programme is a Community funding initiative aimed specifically at the fisheries sector.  The programme was launched last week as part of the Community's response to the structural changes in the fishing industry brought about as a consequence of a number of factors, including global fleet reductions, the ongoing instability on the markets and the possible enlargement of the union.  These factors have serious implicatons for regions which are predominantly or entirely dependent on fisheries to support their local economy.</P>
      <P>The aims of PESCA are to help the fishing industry overcome these difficulties and so to contribute to the socioeconomic survival of regions dependent on fisheries through the development of job-creating measures.  Some ECU 250 million has been set aside for PESCA over the period 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific elements of the programme have not yet been ironed out but I understand that aid will be available for, <i>inter alia</i>, diversification into other activities such as tourism and measures <Col N="851" /> which help create or maintain employment in such regions.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the programme will be finalised, after consultation with member states and the European Parliament, sometime in May this year.  Meanwhile the Department is analysing the programme and its implications for the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>The total 1992 expenditure in respect of anti-asthmatic drugs in the General Medical Services Scheme was £10.76 million.  This figure, however, may include expenditure on drugs for persons who do not have asthma but require certain products that are categorised as anti-asthmatic drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit offers on-going financial support to the asthma society for the development of its asthma awareness strategy.  Since it was established in 1988 the unit has funded the printing of Asthma Society titles such as <i>Asthma Information Booklet</i> and <i>Asthma &mdash; Take <Col N="861" /> it in your Stride.</i> A further publication which assists teachers to identify and manage children with asthma entitled <i>Asthma and School &mdash; A Guide for Teachers</i> was developed in 1992 and circulated to all schools.  Knowing what may trigger off asthma should help teachers and parents to be more vigilant and help them detect an asthmatic child at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The most recent addition to the asthma society's titles <i>Asthma and Pregnancy</i> will be printed with funding from my Department's health promotion unit.  This will be circulated to ante-natal clinics, informing women of the facts and helping to allay any fears which they might have about their own health or that of the baby.</P>
    <P>One of the major risk factors for people with asthma is exposure to tobacco smoke.  You will be aware that my Department has a very comprehensive anti-tobacco strategy embracing legislative, educational and fiscal measures which are all geared at reducing both the prevalence of smoking and the impact of passive smoking.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system. Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help (or the spouse of a part-time home help) is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The issue of payment for part-time home helps has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  It was in response to previous questions in this House that I undertook to raise the concerns regarding pay and other matters with the Chief Executive Officers of the Health Boards.  I have contacted the boards requesting that, as a group, the Chief Executive Officers consider the issue of differences in the rates of pay to home helps between Boards and the diversity of arrangements for providing the service.</P>
    <P>I understand that this group have already begun to work on appraising these issues which I would hope will help to identify and evaluate the concerns regarding the remuneration of home helps in the context of maintaining a valuable and effective Home Help service.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a recent press report which questioned the <Col N="865" /> continuing legal prohibition on cannabis and other drugs and suggested that it was now time to consider their legalisation.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex issue but I can assure the Deputy that the trend internationally is to continue to control such drugs.  I recently attended a meeting of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe which endorsed the view that deregulation was not the preferred approach.  The move by the Dutch authorities is very much an experiment and cannot be taken in isolation from that country's liberal approach to the control of other drugs.</P>
      <P>However, in recognition of the fact that not every person is prepared or able to withdraw totally from the use of drugs, the Eastern Health Board is providing a comprehensive methadone maintenance programme to assist abusers to lead as far as is possible, normal lives and to regularise their behaviour.  Methadone is a heroin substitute and I would point out that this strategy is in line with the recommendations of the Government's HIV-AIDS and drug abuse prevention strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 165 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the <Col N="866" /> opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provided general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parent's means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>The Health Research Board is the main mechanism through which State funding is channelled to medical and related research.  The board has funded considerable research into birth defects, especially neural tube defects: some of this research is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Information on birth defects is available from a number of sources; registers operate in the Eastern Health Board area and in Galway; the birth notification scheme collects information on birth defects which are apparent before a new born baby is discharged from hospital and information would also be available from the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme in respect of babies with birth defects who were subsequently treated in an acute hospital.  I consider that it would be more appropriate to consider how existing sources of information on birth defects can be developed rather than developing a separate register.</P>

      <P>Attendance at conferences or seminars on relevant policy topics is intrinsic to the role of senior officers involved in policy making in a rapidly evolving area such as the health services.  Attendance at such conferences represents a cost-effective way of keeping abreast of new developments and ensuring the dissemination of <Col N="868" /> best practice in the provision and management of services.  Decisions on attendance at particular conferences are made using criteria such as relevance of topic, availability of a suitable officer to attend, cost to the Department etc.  It has not been necessary to develop any more formal guidelines to date and, as can be seen from the attached data on conference and seminar attendances in the years in question, attendance at the invitation of drug companies has not arisen.</P>
      <P>The attached tabular statement details the conferences and seminars attended by officials of my Department in the years in question and the organisations who organised the events.  It is not normal practice to give names of officials in reply to parliamentary questions.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health provides capital grants for the implementation of modern information technology systems in the health services (including hospitals, health boards and other health agencies). The level of provision this year is £6 million.  Under health service IT policy, individual agencies are actively involved in prioritising their IT requirements and in the selection of appropriate solutions. This policy framework has resulted in a very notable increase in the application of IT throughout the whole health service over recent years.  Major IT initiatives <Col N="872" /> have been supported in a number of agencies including, Beaumont Hospital, St. James's Hospital, the mater Miseracordiae Hospital and the North-Western Health Board.  In addition, support has been given to practically all major health agencies to assist them in pursuing their IT related initiatives.  It is intended, within the resources available, to continue the programme in order to ensure that health agencies can avail of the full range of benefits offered by developments in information technology.</P>

      <P>My Department has been involved in discussions with the post-primary school managerial associations in relation to the application of fair and objective selection criteria for entry to second level schools.  An agreed memorandum of understanding was drawn up and a copy issued to each post-primary school. While school enrolment policy is a matter for the authorities of each individual school, my Department and the national representatives of school managerial associations agreed that selection on the basis of academic ability must be discontinued. It was also agreed that it is important that each school should disclose its enrolment policy and the criteria used in selecting pupils for enrolment. Parents will thus be fully informed on the selection procedures and this will help to allay fears of discrimination against their children.  The agreed memorandum also provided that, where difficulties arise in the enrolment of a pupil or pupils in any particular type of post-primary school, the Department and the appropriate managerial body will, through the mechanism <Col N="874" /> of a monitoring committee for each particular sector, consider each case with a view to resolving the difficulty following consultation, where necessary, with the school authorities and the appropriate trustees.</P>

      <P>Aid from the European Social Fund is not transmitted directly by my Department to institutions in the education sector.  Exchequer funded institutions receive global budgets in respect of a range of activities covering both mainstream and ESF aided programmes. Aid from the European Social Fund is an integral part of the global budgets and receipts in respect of approved programmes are lodged as an Appropriation-in-Aid to the relevant Vote of my Department.</P>
      <P>It would take an inordinate amount of time to carry out an analysis of the proportion of ESF receipts attributable to the budgets of individual institutions. The overall amount of ESF aid generated by programmes funded by my Department since 1985 is as follows:</P>
