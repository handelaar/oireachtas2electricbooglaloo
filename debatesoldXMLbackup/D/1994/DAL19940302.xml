      <P>I request the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate a motion requiring the Government to lay before the Dáil for debate, in advance of finalisation, any proposals it may have to revise the timing, the priority or the nature of <Col N="1198" /> investments to be made under the National Development Plan arising from the Government's failure to obtain the annualised flow of funds it assumed it would get when it originally submitted the plan to the Dáil for approval.  Any changes the Government is presenting to unelected &mdash; to use its own words &mdash; officials in Brussels should first be presented to the elected Members of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the record will show that during the debate <Col N="1203" /> on the taxation of unemployment benefits when the question of equality payments for women was raised, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Fitzgerald, promised legislation on that matter.  She promised legislation on freedom of information.</P>

      <P>No one has contributed greater to perpetrating a fraud on the electorate than Deputy De Rossa and his party.  Since the report of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 substantial improvements have been made in the rates of social welfare and many other improvements have been introduced to make the system more user friendly.  This year the Minister has made further improvements to the system.  The general increases are at the rate of 3 per cent, which is above the rate of inflation. Special increases have been introduced in order to increase the lower benefit rates to a more acceptable level.  There has been a 6 per cent increase in the personal rate of short term payments. <Col N="1206" /> There has been a flat rate increase of £2.10 in the weekly rate of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and injury benefit.  There has been an increase of £8.50 in the personal rate of invalidity pension for those over 66 years of age to raise their benefits to a level equal to that of the old age contributory pension. Those increases show that the Government is intent on bringing benefits up to a level sufficient to help those in receipt of various forms of assistance.</P>
      <P>Over the years I met many widowers who had to depend on unemployment assistance to raise their children.  I welcome the introduction of a survivor's pension which will entitle widowers with the necessary contributions to a contributory pension.  This is a most welcome family-orientated amendment.  I also welcome the decision to increase the disregard limit in respect of lone parents from £6 to £30.  This measure will be psychologically and financially beneficial to those in that position.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance introduced a number of years ago by the Minister, Deputy Woods, was very beneficial to thousands of people who, up to then, had received no benefit or assistance from the State.  The Minister has taken this measure a step further by allowing up to £100 to be disregarded for means assessment of applicants for the allowance.  As a result many more thousands of people will qualify for assistance.  Despite misleading statements over the years by members of the Opposition, the scheme has proved to be an outstanding success and will be more successful as a result of the aforementioned change.</P>
      <P>The Bill is jobs-orientated through the provisions aimed at protecting jobs in the labour-intensive sector.  Such provisions include a reduction in PRSI payable by employers in respect of employees with weekly earnings of up to £173, the introduction of the new PRSI exemption scheme for employers who take on unemployed people and the increase of £10 in the income limits for eligibility under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other provisions I specifically welcome are those that recognise the importance <Col N="1207" /> of the family, for example, the increase from £5 to £10 in the minimum rate of unemployment assistance for young people living at home, the extension of the definition of child dependant in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to enable increases to be paid in respect of children over 18 years who are attending study courses and the decision to allow participants in special schemes to hold onto their entitlements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is a great improvement on the present system.</P>
    <P>Under the free travel scheme a husband or wife of a person with a free travel pass is entitled to a companion pass. However, if the holder of the free travel pass is in hospital the other spouse may have to travel long distances to the hospital but is not entitled to free travel. This can be a very expensive, traumatic time for many people and I would ask the Minister to consider introducing a scheme to alleviate the hardship caused.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the contributory old age pension as it applies to the self-employed sector. There is a provision whereby contributions must be made for ten years before a person qualifies for the pension. In many cases people who reach the age of 66 have only seven or eight years contributions and do not qualify for the pension. In the past a study was undertaken into the possibility of allowing such people to make voluntary contributions. I would like to know whether that study has been concluded and whether there are plans to bring forward a voluntary contribution system, particularly as there are only 4,000 to 5,000 people involved.</P>
    <P>This Bill continues in the Fianna Fáil tradition of ensuring that those dependent on the social welfare system are treated with respect and dignity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

He has introduced many sensible amendments to the system and the Bill deserves the full support of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that the Minister administers one of the biggest budgets and holds a very responsible Ministry.  I would like him to clarify the position of the facilitators who were recently appointed to the social welfare office and also the placement officers currently employed by FÁS.  A one-stop-shop concept has been developed in this area and in many cases placement officers and facilitators work within the one building.  Is there a separate function for each post or is there an overlap in their work?</P>
      <P>Many of the long term unemployed have lost their self-esteem by virtue of being unemployed for many years.  The training courses and social employment schemes set up in recent times for these people are a temporary palliative to counteract unemployment.  Many people are referred to organisations or to personnel in the social welfare area for consideration for courses and quite often unsatisfactory criteria are used in the selection process &mdash; for example, if they do not participate in such a course they are likely to have unemployment assistance withdrawn.  Perhaps it would be better if the 120,000 long term unemployed were properly interviewed to find out their interests and desires and see whether the marketplace can cater for their needs.  Even though the Minister is improving the social welfare system, the poverty trap still exists.  There is no incentive to work for people earning £10,000 to £15,000 who have children; I accept that only 5,000 to 6,000 people come into that category.  With average earnings at £8,000 to £10,000 per year there is no incentive for a married man with children to work in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement was introduced to reduce the differential between low earnings and social welfare, <Col N="1209" /> but statistics show that many people who qualify for the supplement do not claim it.  Surely it must be possible, as I suggested previously, to circulate in employers' pay packets a leaflet informing them of the family income supplement. As a public representative, I have been surprised to have to advise employees on occasion of the existence of the family income supplement as a mechanism to provide extra financial support, an inducement to remain in work.</P>
    <P>We should do everything possible to encourage the unemployed to get back to work.  In the last few years people have been forced into unemployment: a classic example are local authority employees.  In all provincial papers the big issue for weeks on end is the condition of public roads.  In the past ten years when redundancy packages were announced by successive Governments &mdash; I blame all Governments for this &mdash; they were usually availed of by outdoor workers.  On top of that there was a natural reduction in the workforce, leading to a depleted local authority workforce. While the social employment schemes are very positive from the point of view of local authorities, the work carried out under them is concentrated exclusively in urban areas &mdash; for example, the restoration of footpaths, planting trees, etc. This is meaningful work, but at the end of the year when the work is finished there is no incentive for the participants to seek further employment and statistics prove that most participants revert back into the social welfare system.  If we are serious about the creation of jobs and giving something back to local authorities, the participants in these schemes must be given full time jobs.  A new social employment scheme could act as a type of apprenticeship for these people and would not be a significant burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Our priorities are totally misplaced. This can be seen from the National Development Plan in which major emphasis is placed in training courses. While this is desirable, over the past few years too much emphasis has been placed <Col N="1210" /> on training courses, community enterprise development programmes, social employment schemes etc. instead of on sustainable long term jobs.  There would be no significant difference between the amount paid to a person on a social employment scheme and the amount he would be paid in a fulltime job.  This would send out positive vibes to local authorities and lead to the creation of significant jobs.  Years ago people had a sense of pride in their work but that sense of pride no longer exists.  Consideration needs to be given to this issue.</P>
    <P>FÁS has been in existence in one form or another for approximately 30 years.  A quality assessment of the training courses offered by this organisation should be carried out.  Very often an applicant is debarred from a job not because of his characteristics but because the course he has pursued has not advanced sufficiently from a technological point of view to meet the advances in the marketplace. This gap needs to be examined.  A proper quality assessment should be carried out of all courses to ensure that the participants are able to obtain sustainable jobs.  Approximately 28 per cent of the special skills training programmes offered by FÁS have less than a 50 per cent success rate in terms of jobs placement. People who have gone through the education system and spent approximately 18 weeks on a training course find it frustrating when they cannot find a sustainable job in the area they want.</P>
    <P>People who are employed often knock the unemployed by saying they do not want to work, that they are happy to draw unemployment benefit.  I know many adults and young people on unemployment benefit who have lost their self-esteem and get no kick from receiving benefits from the State.  Unemployment is soul destroying for these people.  If we try to solve the cancer of unemployment in our society through temporary training courses, without giving serious consideration to the job training aspect, it will simply lead to more frustration, particularly among younger people, who as a result of technological advancements are very intelligent and know what is <Col N="1211" /> happening.  We need to tackle this issue in a serious way.  Instead of talking about an expanded social welfare bill each year we should be looking at ways of reducing this bill and creating employment.  I do not think enough has been done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is going to Brussels today in an effort to maintain our budget for training. While this is desirable, more consideration needs to be given to the concept of training courses.  We are inclined to regard training courses as a quick fix for the problems which exist in our society instead of regarding them as a temporary solution.</P>
    <P>Much reference is made to the creation of enterprises and assistance for budding entrepreneurs.  Is the Minister aware that during the past week instructions were issued to FÁS that the enterprise allowance scheme as we know it is being suspended? This scheme was a positive inducement to a person on social welfare to create a viable business.  The amount of money involved was not significant &mdash; it amounted to approximately £3,000 per annum &mdash; but it gave younger people and budding entrepreneurs the incentive to set up businesses; it gave them some support during the vital first year.  The suspension of this scheme is sending out the wrong signals to these people.</P>
    <P>We still do not have a proper climate for the creation of jobs.  The UK Minister for the Environment has instructed all British local authorities to ensure that people who want to set up a business in a garage or room in their house, not causing any problems for neighbours, should not have to apply for planning permission.  The opposite is the case in Ireland.  For example, last week I heard of a young person who set up a panel-beating business in a garage which is 20 years old and who, in order to benefit for the enterprise allowance scheme, had to prove that he did not require planning permission for the garage.  However, he has now been told that he requires planning permission even though the garage <Col N="1212" /> is 20 years old and is not near any residential property.  Very often, the system here acts as a disincentive to the creation of jobs.  We have to give serious consideration to the removal of those barriers. We have to be innovative in our thinking if we want to help people and give them the incentive to create jobs.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue which I think the Minister has addressed in the Bill, the position of casual workers.  I have raised on the Adjournment here the position of a meat company in Rathkeale, where the employees are almost on continuous short-time, working one day per week and drawing social welfare for the other days.  These employees are caught in a no man's land.  They are regarded as fulltime workers and cannot avail of a medical card or any of the other benefits. The serious anomalies which have emerged are a source of frustration for these people and are acting as a disincentive to their remaining in the work environment. Reference has been made in the past to the position of dockers, who do not earn much money during the year.  I think the Minister has dealt with the position of these workers in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is good at PR.  He reacted very quickly to the decision to tax widow's contributory pensions.  I want to thank my colleague, Deputy Allen, and the Fine Gael Party for highlighting this issue so effectively.  These smaller aspects of a budget are often forgotten and, as I said, the Minister reacted swiftly.  For a Minister who likes to enjoy good public relations, the reaction he got from the public was not positive.  The Minister also met the various widows associations and discussed this issue with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Deputy Ahern referred to the fact that when the self-employed pension scheme was introduced in 1988 it was regarded as a laudable measure.  However, the sting in the tail was that a person had to have ten years' contributions to qualify for the scheme.  Many people who were participating in that scheme were caught in a limbo because of the ten year stipulation and it was not possible for them to get a full or part payment of their contributory pensions.  If a person has six years' contributions it should be possible for the person to receive three-fifths of a pension; if a person has two years' contributions he or she should receive one-fifth of a pension and if a person has eight years' contributions he or she should receive four-fifths.  It was promised at the time that the difficulty of those who found themselves in that limbo would be considered, but to date that problem has not been addressed.  I would like to hear the Minister's views in this regard.</P>
    <P>The sting in the tail of the budget and of this Social Welfare Bill will not be felt for some time.  Other difficult areas include the taxation of unemployment benefit, but an additional problem will be the loss of pay-related benefit of £16.80 per week.  Many people will be shocked when they become aware of this. One of my constituents spoke to me in this regard last Monday.  He was receiving unemployment benefit and was also looking for a job.  I told him that his situation would worsen in the future because not only will his unemployment benefit be taxed but he will also lose his pay-related benefit concession.  My understanding is that people drawing unemployment benefit &mdash; I believe the number is approximately 70,000, I may be incorrect in that figure but it represents a significant proportion of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission made other recommendations which have not been introduced.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on a problem that has been highlighted, which involves old people who should be entitled to a free telephone or free electricity allowance.  In many cases there is a telephone extension connected to another member of the family.  If the telephone is in the elderly person's house with an extension in the home of another member of the family, that elderly person does not qualify for a free telephone allowance.</P>
      <P>The same often applies in the case of the free electricity allowance.  An elderly person may live alone beside a farm house in which other members of the family are living.  The electricity bills are sent to the member of the family who is working or farming, as the case may be. Even though the elderly person's lifeline is the telephone or the electricity, that person is not entitled to any of those concessions.  I know a woman of 78 years of age who is very concerned about this matter.  Extending such entitlement to those people would not require huge resources.  Many of them live in their own homes; they do not require to be cared for in nursing homes or other institutions. They are being allowed to live in society near their families.  I would ask the Minister to give consideration to this important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that in recent times new Government offices have opened incorporating large social <Col N="1215" /> welfare departments.  They are lavish offices with large areas at the front which were originally designed to accommodate people queuing for their social welfare payments.  These people are now required to go for these payments to post offices, which are often much smaller premises.  We now have nice buildings to accommodate the officials, but the ordinary punter wishing to avail of the services is diverted to another location. What is the Minister going to do about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some points regarding the problems confronting any Minister for Social Welfare when drafting annual budgetary proposals. It is vital that the acute needs of those in receipt of social welfare support are fully acknowledged and it is taken for granted that the resources made available to the weaker sectors of our society are at least sufficient to compensate for any increase in inflation.  The extra financial resources required to cover these minimal requirements can often be quite substantial. A variety of social trends can add to the difficulty of at least maintaining the value of social welfare payments, including an increase in the size of the available <Col N="1216" /> labour force, additional numbers of retired people and overall population growth.  Consequently, the extent of resources available to the Minister to allow for the enhancement of existing schemes and the introduction of innovation programmes is quite limited.</P>
      <P>Despite these realities the proposals of the Minister and his team are welcome on two fronts.  First, they allow for an improvement in real terms in a number of important schemes.  I shall consider some of the more significant examples of such improvements in a moment.</P>
      <P>I should have said that I wish to share my time with Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív with the agreement of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, the current budgetary proposals, compared with budgets over recent years, show an increasing level of integrated planning by the Minister which is vital if we are to achieve the goal of decreasing dependency on the social welfare system in the longer term.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach might be summarised as a combination of four main points: first, giving priority to those with the greatest level of need; second, progressively changing the socio-economic climate to maximise job opportunities for the unemployed while facilitating potential employers in the area of job creation; third, encouraging a much greater degree of personal enterprise and fourth, reducing the scope for abuse within the social welfare system.  A number of elements in the Minister's proposed measures are consistent with those goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will focus on the various changes designed to increase the level of job creation.  While the Bill contains a number of such elements, I should like to mention first the new PRSI exemption proposal allowing employers full exemption from PRSI contributions for a period of up to two years for all extra jobs created in the State in the ensuing fiscal year.  The Minister estimated there would be an annual saving of £1,268 in respect <Col N="1217" /> of an employee earning £200 per week. In addition to providing a tremendous incentive to employers with the potential to add new employees to their payrolls the measure also has the advantage that the financial benefit to an employer is immediate, involving the minimum of red tape.  The proposal to reduce employers' share of PRSI contributions from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent in respect of employees earning £173 or less per week is equally likely to stimulate employment creation since its net effect is expected to involve a transfer of £46 million per annum to the job creation sector.</P>
    <P>A number of changes in regard to the health contribution and employment and training levies are in line with the policy of PRSI reform.  For example, employers of medical card holders can benefit to the extent of 2.25 per cent.  Similarly, low paid employees without medical card status will benefit directly from these changes.  While the Minister increased the ceiling for PRSI contributions that is perhaps a small concession within the overall context of the proposals before us.  I fully support his identification of the PRSI system as one capable of being reformed to the direct and immediate benefit of employer and employee.  I have no doubt that this Bill will result in a number of extra jobs coming on-stream over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition, a wide range of improved and new social welfare payments are proposed. I particularly welcome two payments, namely, those proposed to be made to widowers and elderly invalids. The so-called survivor's pension is very welcome since it acknowledges for the first time that the loss of a spouse can be as devastating for a man as for a woman. While the cost of this extension is estimated at £27 million in a full year it will provide much needed support for the many men and women who must learn to cope with the greatly changed domestic environment on the loss of their spouse.</P>
    <P>The manner in which a society treats its elderly is an excellent indicator of its level of humanity and compassion, the needs of the sick or infirm among the elderly being particularly important. <Col N="1218" /> Therefore, I am pleased that the pensions of invalids aged 66 years or over are being increased to the level of the contributory old age pension.  The 10 per cent increase in social welfare payments for those in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit is a complementary measure which is to be greatly welcomed and should result in a real improvement in the standard of living of families or individuals in receipt of such payments.</P>
    <P>The increase of 6 per cent for those in receipt of short term payments, such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance is also needed.  It must not be overlooked that a 3 per cent minimum increase has been provided for the vast majority of social welfare recipients and that the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy benefits all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>However, a number of other increases will certainly provide welcome supplementary income to a number of family units.  I shall mention some of them briefly.  First, the proposed increases in child benefit payments will be of particular value to large families.  For example, a family with six children will benefit to the extent of £11 per month. The additional payment of £6 per week to almost 10,000 families resulting from improvements in the family income supplement is equally welcome.  Following the recent introduction of legislation necessary for the establishment of a register of stillbirths it is appropriate that maternity benefits should be extended to mothers of stillborn infants where the duration of the pregnancy was 24 weeks or more.  This is a particularly positive measure, which I warmly welcome.</P>
    <P>People involved in casual work are vulnerable in a number of ways.  First, their work is often uncertain and, as a result, does not provide a sufficient level of security.  Second, such an employee may have little or no control over terms and-or conditions of employment.  Indeed, in certain instances, they may be open to a degree of exploitation.  The proposals in section 19 of this Bill &mdash; which allow casual workers easier access to unemployment benefit &mdash; demonstrate a welcome <Col N="1219" /> sensitivity to a very deserving sector of our workforce.  In a modern, rapidly changing society it is vital that our numerous laws and financial provisions demonstrate an openness to acceptance of change.  For example, sections 24, 25 and 31 of this Bill provide excellent examples of the Legislature reacting to the changed needs of our citizens.  Sections 24 and 25, for example, allow for the retention of secondary social welfare benefits for unemployed people participating in various approved community and education schemes.  As companies attempt to retain their profitability in an increasingly competitive workplace a trend has developed of subcontracting work to former employees.  A lorry driver with a large company might be encouraged to lease or purchase his vehicle and accept a contract in place of permanent employment. In such instances an employee may feel that he has little option but to agree to the proposed new arrangements.  In addition, the new work status of such an employee can result in the loss of occupational injury benefits.  The provisions of section 31 of the Bill are designed as a response to such developments within the modern industrial sector.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 form a necessary part of continuous efforts to eliminate abuses of the social welfare system in that, where necessary, they allow access by social welfare inspectors to employment records held by contractors and subcontractors.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude my comments on specific provisions of the Bill by referring to some of the improvements <i>vis-á-vis</i> means-testing.  While means tests are necessary for the proper implementation of social welfare systems they have often proved to be a source of extreme annoyance, their specific terms excessive and unnecessary.  Sections 15 and 16 of this Bill relax means test regulations in two particularly sensitive areas.  First, the changes result in substantial improvements for people benefiting from the lone parent's allowance.  The Minister gave an example of a lone parent earning £80 per week who will benefit to the extent of <Col N="1220" /> £18.90.  The increased relief for those in receipt of the carer's allowance is equally welcome since very often such people are the unsung heroes within our community.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to support the various provisions of this Bill since their overall direction is toward a more streamlined set of measures drafted with particular attention paid to the needs of those suffering particular disadvantage.  I congratulate the Minister and his staff on their well balanced, sensitive policies.</P>
    <P>A certain degree of complexity cannot be avoided in drafting social welfare provisions because of the range and diversity of support structures vital to the well-being of all citizens.  Unfortunately, sometimes those most in need of the benefits to be derived from such provisions may not be fully conversant with their specific entitlements.  I strongly urge that every effort be made to ensure that all citizens are made fully aware of their social welfare rights.  While the Minister and his staff have published a wide range of excellent brochures of assistance in this respect, our formal educational system must play an increasing role in fully informing citizens of both their rights and responsibilities.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm labhairt ar an mBille seo.  Ní don chéad uair atá an tAire tar éis athruithe suntasacha a thabhairt isteach chun feabhais a chur ar an gcóras leasa shóisialaigh. Tá cúpla bliain anois ó thug sé isteach rialacha agus socruithe maidir le hoibrithe páirt-aimsearacha, céim mhór nár tugadh dóthain aitheantais dó ag an am ach gur mhór an tairbhe í do na daoine sin nach raibh aon chearta acu faoin gcóras.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mbliana is é cás na mbaintreach atá á phlé ag an Aire agus déanaim comhgháirdeas leis as scéim speisialta a thabhairt isteach faoin a bhfhaighidh baintreach fir na cearta céanna agus a bhí á bhfáil ag baintreacha go dtí seo.  Is áthas liom freisin gur éirigh leis é sin a dhéanamh gan aon teora ioncaim a chur leis.  Is mór an dul chun cinn é seo mar sa lá atá inniú ann is é an brú céanna atá ar <Col N="1221" /> fhir agus mhná má fhágtar in a mbain-treacha iad.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for further improving the social welfare system and the delivery of the service to the customer.  It is hard to imagine that a few years ago it was a terrible ordeal for people and it was considered that information about entitlements and so on was privileged.  That has all changed.  A person now has a right to information and technological advances, etc. have made for a fair and customer friendly delivery of the service.  It would not matter how good the service was if it were not delivered in an efficient, friendly and open manner.  It is an example to other Departments of how a complex and complicated system can be delivered to the public in an efficient manner.  There is the odd hiccup, but when one considers that everyone in the State is involved with the social welfare system, either making payments or benefiting from it, this is not surprising.</P>
    <P>The thorny issue of means testing has been tackled.  When I was elected to the Seanad for the first time, the biggest issue was testing small farmers, fishermen and mná tí.  The rules which applied to means testing were severe and acted as a disincentive to people taking up any form of employment.  As resources permitted, the Minister tackled this problem.  I welcome the changes he made.</P>
    <P>An chéad bhliain go raibh mise i mo Sheanadóir d'athaíodh na rialacha a bhai-neann le mná tí a choinníonn scoláirí Gaeilge faoi scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge.  Baineadh amach as an gcóras leasa shóisialaigh ar fad an maoin a shaothraíonn siad as an ngníomhaíocht sin.  Ba mhór an spreagadh é sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tá sé le sonrú i mbliana go bhfuil go leor mná tí breise ag coinneáil Gaelgeoirí i ngeall ar na hathruithe sin.</P>
    <P>Ag an am sin freisin bhaintí airgead leasa shóisialaigh ó dhaoine i ngeall ar fataí agus glasraí a fhás agus ar mhóin a bhaint.  Arís d'athruigh an tAire é seo agus dúirt nach gcuirfí in áireamh é nuair a bheadh scrúdú maoine a chur i bhfeidhm.  Fáiltím go mór roimh na <Col N="1222" /> cumhachtaí sa Bhille gníomhaíochtaí traidisiúnta ar chósta an iarthair mar bailiú feamainne agus mar sin de a fhágáil saor ón scrúdú maoine as seo amach. Tréaslaím leis an Aire i leith an dul chun cinn seo a thabharfaidh spreagadh do dhaoine cur ar a son féin, agus tá buí-ochas mhuintir an iarthair tuillte aige. Fáiltím freisin faoi na hathruithe ar scrúdú maoine ar dhreamanna atá ag dhéanamh cúraim ar dhaoine eile.</P>
    <P>The carers allowance scheme has often been derided because of the obvious restrictions which had to be placed on the scheme on its inception.  I welcome the change in the system of means testing for this allowance.  The scheme has been extended to a greater number of people. When first introduced it mainly benefited those who had a dependent spouse.  With the dramatic change which has been made, those on low incomes whose spouses are full time carers will be able to benefit from the scheme.  We all look forward to the day when resources permit the scheme to be extended still further.</P>
    <P>The changes in means testing of the lone parent's allowance is significant.  A system should be devised whereby the rent allowance could be taken into account and gradually decreased.  At present the Department is willing to reduce the lone parent's allowance on a phased basis, but there is no similar system in relation to rented accommodation. A large number of lone parents live in such accommodation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the changes made to the RSI scheme.  Many people did not know that if they possessed a medical card they were exempt from paying the levies.  As a result they have paid more RSI than was necessary. The fact that there is a minimum of £173 per week and that employers are exempt from paying the levies is a great step forward.  I would hope that in the future these benefits would relate more to income than to medical cards, because relating them to medical cards creates its own problems.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím go mór roimh an mBille.  Tá an oiread ann agus go bhféadfaimis bheith ag caint faoi go deo.  Nuair a bheidh Céim <Col N="1223" /> an Choiste ar siúil creidim go mbeidh go leor rudaí á bplé go mion agus go bhfeicfear go leor tairbhí eile sa reacht-aíocht seo.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to rehash what has been said about the Social Welfare Bill, because Government speakers take a certain line in relation to praising it and Opposition spokespersons take the line of finding fault.  I would rather address myself to problems I see in the general social welfare schemes, which I have often addressed in this House by means of parliamentary questions.  What I am about to say today will be similar to what I said in this House a year ago when speaking on the Social Welfare Bill.  At that time I referred to a number of short-comings and injustices that exist.  I am sorry to say they have not been addressed in this Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív referred to the progressive relaxation of the means test during the past number of years.  I acknowledge the fact that there have been relaxations in the means test, but I would remind both the Deputy and the Minister that the means test, as it operates is still restrictive and frequently is unjust and unfair.  Last year I dealt with the means testing of a small farmer who makes application for a non-contributory <Col N="1224" /> benefit, such as unemployment assistance &mdash; some people call it the small farmer's dole &mdash; or the old age pension.  This assessment is done on the basis of expenses and gross income to the farm.</P>
    <P>In 1986 means testing was changed from the notional system &mdash; until then it was based on poor law evaluation of land &mdash; to the factual or the actual system, a change I welcome.  A former Minister for Social Welfare, Mrs. Hussey, clearly pointed out when responding to much criticism of the means testing system at that time, that it would be factual and that the idea of notionality would be gone from the system.  Alas, that has not happened.</P>
    <P>I have here an IN. 93 form which is used by social welfare officers when making such assessments.  A question on the form asks the applicant for the value of his sales or the value of his produce, which he declares.  The social welfare officer, under regulations laid down by the Minister for Social Welfare operates a system whereby the total sum of the value of sales of livestock or whatever is made up; and if it is too close for comfort to the value of expenses, then the social welfare officer introduces an element of notionality.  This is adverse to the interests of the applicant, because you then have what are called &ldquo;average annual sales&rdquo;.  In 100 per cent of cases the effect is to increase the value of sales from the farm.  The basis for this is not explained.  As I said in this House a year ago, and in the meantime by way of parliamentary question, it brings back something which was supposed to be abolished in the Social Welfare Bill of 1985 or 1986. I suggest to the Minister that that system is unfair and unjust and I am convinced it is in breach of the Social Welfare Act, which was supposed to get rid of it seven or eight years ago.  I ask the Minister to examine that aspect and see it for what it is, an injustice.</P>
    <P>I should also like to speak on a topic to which I referred last year, disregards of income.  I welcome the fact that the disregard of income for the carers allowance has been increased from £6 per week to £106 per week for a principal earner. <Col N="1225" /> Disregards, which were introduced as far back as 1973, operate for old age pensioners and for non-contributory widows pensions at £6 or £7 per week.  About two years ago I elicited from the Minister or his predecessor that if you took 1973, or whatever year disregards were introduced, as a base year at £6 per week and took into account all the cost of living increases and rate of inflation indices in the meantime, it would be worth £30 per week today.  I ask the Minister to examine that aspect of means testing.  Why do we not keep it close to its real value as it was when introduced in the early seventies? Surely ordinary justice demands that that be done.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of introducing disregards for applicants for unemployment assistance. That is one of the social welfare benefits that do not enjoy the benefit of disregard.</P>
    <P>Widows who qualify for a widow's non-contributory pension get a bad deal from the Department.  They do not receive any fringe benefits and do not qualify for free fuel allowance, free travel or free telephone allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They qualify for the free fuel unless they have other income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>If their income exceeds their pension by £5 per week they are disqualified from free fuel allowance. Surely that is not something the Minister should defend in this House; rather it is something we ought to be ashamed of.  I ask the Minister that when widows reach 60 years of age the fringe benefits applicable to old age pensioners on non-contributory payments be extended to them. Often widows who live alone and in rural areas cannot afford a telephone or to adequately heat their homes.  The free electricity allowance would make an enormous difference to them.  When the Minister has finished his consultation perhaps he would take that point on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that many widows between the ages of 60 and 66 enjoy the benefits their husbands had.  That is a big step ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1226" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big step ahead, but the Minister should extend, as I request, all these benefits to widows who reach 60 years of age.  The Minister would certainly be remembered for his enlightenment if he were to accede to that request.  An interesting case on equality payments has been raised by a number of women in my constituency.  Thirty women in the Castlerea area are aggrieved by the equality settlement as they were recipients of social welfare, as adult dependants on their husbands, during the time covered by the court decision.  These women have made a case to the Department but have not got a positive response, although it was also raised by way of parliamentary question. Will the Minister seriously consider the point made by these ladies?  It might have large financial implications but they have made a very good case in ordinary justice. The basis of their case is as good as the basis on which the case was successfully won in the European Court by women who directly received a lower rate of unemployment assistance because they happened to be women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connor for allowing me some time.  I recall the speech I made at this time last year and note that a number of the anomalies raised then are still there.  I concede that this Bill has brought about certain administrative and financial improvements but difficulties still remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate for social welfare is steadily approaching a £4 billion account. That is something the Minister and the Department can be proud of but on the other hand it shows the huge social problems and that unemployment is out of hand.  We are attempting to have a debate about Structural Funds and whether the sum will be £6 billion, £7 billion, £8 billion or whatever the Minister for Finance will think up.  The social welfare bill for 1994 at approximately £3.8 billion could use up the vast majority of that Euro sum.  That shows the dependency culture we have created over the years.  Many social welfare payments are necessary and money poured into old age pensions <Col N="1227" /> is inadequate for the needs, but in certain ways the payments we are making are creating a poverty trap from which people cannot escape.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that more progress has not been made by the junior Minister, Deputy Burton, in putting together policies to integrate the tax and social welfare systems.  The present system has made it impossible for employers to create jobs and for employees to take up jobs on offer.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains some improvements but many difficulties need to be addressed. For almost a decade Cork County Council has been pleading on an annual basis for some of the money spent on social welfare payments to be transferred directly to the Department of the Environment to put people back to work. Rural roads were never in such a state of disrepair and every local authority is crying out for money to buy materials and to employ more people.  We could use social welfare money in a better fashion by diverting it to this area.  It is tragic that money, which by adding another 10 per cent could be used to employ people, is being spent to keep people on the dole.  This is warped social policy and it contributes to a breakdown in society.  The Minister should set up some sort of task force or commission with the Minister for the Environment to consider transferring funds, even on a pilot basis, to put people back to work. Surely a Minister with a budget of £3.8 billion should use some of it to create employment.</P>
    <P>There have been improvements in the means testing system, but the assessment of meagre savings is blatantly unfair.  I refer to people applying for unemployment assistance or for old age non-contributory pension.  If having worked all his life a person returns from abroad with £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 in the bank the savings are assessed at 10 per cent and that person is assessed as having an investment income of £500 per annum or almost £10 per week.  A bank, building society, post office savings account or even a Swiss bank will not give anybody <Col N="1228" /> a return of 10 per cent.  When DIRT is taken into account and every other deduction is made, the old age pensioner will have a return of perhaps 4 per cent and will lose £10 a week from his entitlements whereas the loss should be only £3 or £4 a week.  A sum of £5 or £6 a week might not seem much to Dáil Deputies but it is quite a sum for an old age pensioner, the price of a bag of coal, the difference between being warm or cold over the weekend.  Will the Minister look at that 10 per cent assessment which is totally out of touch with reality?</P>
    <P>I concur with what Deputy Connor said about ongoing difficulties with equality payments.  There is major concern throughout Cork city and county about equality payments.  A huge public meeting took place recently on the matter and another is due to take place along with a march to Dáil Éireann on Tuesday or Wednesday next.  I hope the Minister can allay the fears of people about money due to them.  There have been frequent clashes between the Minister and Deputy Allen on this issue at Question Time.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the improvements made to the carer's allowance while acknowledging that further improvements must be made.  The Department is being generous in allowing extra people to benefit but we should note that if there was a further relaxation of that scheme many of the people confined to nursing homes because their sons and daughters are financially unable to look after them would be able to remain in their, homes.  From a social and economic point of view that would make common sense.  Health board subsidies are helping people to stay in nursing homes but I would much prefer if the Department of Social Welfare through a further relaxation of the rules on the carer's allowance enabled people to return home from nursing homes and district hospitals to their families.</P>
    <P>That would be preferable and makes economic and social sense.  I hope the Minister will make further progress on the carer's allowance scheme in 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this excellent Social Welfare Bill.  The Bill gives legal effect to the increase in payments announced in the recent budget and provides for other improvements to strengthen the social welfare code for families, workers, carers, lone parents and others who rely on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bradford referred to the anomalies in the social welfare code, but I will draw attention to the many improvements that have been and will be made by this caring Minister.  An additional £157 million has been provided to improve the incomes of those who depend on social welfare, to support families, to strengthen voluntary and community services and to expand social insurance cover.</P>
      <P>The proposed widower's pension is a major breakthrough in pension provisions and puts Ireland foremost among our European Union neighbours in providing equal treatment for men and women on the death of their spouse.  I understand that over 9,000 widowed men and their families will benefit for the first time under the proposed survivor's pension. The scheme will be introduced in October and men and women will be able to qualify for a contributory survivor's pension on the same basis, that is, on either their own or their late spouse's PRSI record, subject to the same contribution conditions.  Public representatives have been calling for the provision of survivor's pension for men and women on an equal basis.  According to the National Pensions Board, ten countries in the OECD provide for payment of pensions to both widows and widowers, but generally speaking more stringent conditions for qualification apply to men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Woods, on this progressive initiative, <Col N="1230" /> which is a recognition of our family structure. Now that both spouses are participating in the workforce, the surviving spouse, whether a woman or a man, with a young family to rear is likely to need income support.  In excess of 85,500 widows receive pensions under the widow's contributory pension scheme at an annual cost of £282 million, but their situation will not be changed in any way by the introduction of this equal treatment measure.  Some 1,100 invalidity pensioners who have attained 66 years are to have their weekly pension boosted to the level of the contributory pension. This increase will mean an extra £10.20 per week from July for a single person, bringing his or her new weekly payment to £71.  A married couple, who currently receive £100.90, will receive £112.30 from July, an extra £11.40.  This is a significant improvement for older invalidity pensioners, who are among the most vulnerable in our society.  This is in line with the recommendation of the National Pensions Baord.  A couple under the age of 66 will receive the new weekly rate of £103.90, an increase of £3.</P>

      <P>The child dependant increase for larger families on invalidity pension has been substantially improved. The rate goes from £14.90 to £15.20 for each of the first two children and from £12.80 to £15.20 for the third and subsequent children.  There are approximately 39,000 people under the age of 66 years in receipt of invalidity pension and they are also eligible for extra benefits such as fuel, electricity and telephone allowances as well as free travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently confirmed that <Col N="1231" /> no earnings limit will apply to the survivor's pension.  The position of all working widows with families is to be protected in the new survivor's pension scheme to be introduced in October.  This scheme, announced in the budget, will for the first time provide a contributory pension for widowers, a move which will benefit 4,500 widowed men from October. A sum of £60 million has been provided so that the survivor's pension will be paid automatically to all qualified widows and widowers for the first year of bereavement and thereafter an earnings requirement in line with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board was proposed.  Fewer than 300 widows would have earnings in excess of £16,000 per annum, the figure proposed in the budget for qualification.  The Minister, however, expressed his concern to ensure that the position of widows with young families be safeguarded.  Under the proposed arrangement no earnings requirements will apply and all widows and widowers will receive the pension.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is providing much needed support to low paid workers trying to bring up families.  The take up rate has increased on last year and some 96,000 families are getting family income supplement.  In excess of 30,000 children benefit from this payment. The very substantial improvements last year are beginning to have an impact on the rate of take up.  Building on last year's improvements, the weekly income thresholds are again being adjusted to take account of the tax measures announced in the budget.  The thresholds are being increased by £10 and families will get an increase of £6 per week.  In order to improve the position of young mothers who wish to take up work, the means test for the lone parent's allowance is being eased.  The current earnings disregard of £6 for each child is being replaced by a flat rate disregard of £30, with a 15 per cent taper where earnings are over £30 per week.  Where earnings exceed the new rate of disregard, the lone parent's allowance payable will be reduced by £1 for each £2 <Col N="1232" /> earned instead of the £1 for £1 rate currently applying.  I believe that a lone parent with one child who is in receipt of this allowance and is earning £80 per week will be better off by £18.90 per week.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is being increased by 3 per cent and, in addition, there will be an earnings disregard of £100 in the means test.  Most criticism of the carer's allowance has focused on the means test, in particular where the spouse of the carer is working.  I am pleased that the Minister has eased the means test in this situation.  From the figures available I understand that a further 500 carers will now qualify for the allowance and a further 350 existing carers will get an increased allowance.  I welcome also the allocation of £500,000 to the respite care fund this year as this enables very valuable work to be done.</P>
    <P>A number of changes has been announced in the free schemes and this will benefit the weaker sections of our community.  A pensioner being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance will in future retain the free telephone rental allowance.  This was previously discontinued, because the living alone condition ceased to be satisfied.  A pensioner aged 75 years or over who no longer lives alone will retain entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance.  The age requirement of 80 years which applies to the retention of the free electricity allowance will be reduced to 75 years. Widows between the age of 60 and 65, whose late husbands had entitlements to the free schemes, will retain their entitlements notwithstanding their age.</P>
    <P>The free electricity allowance scheme is being extended to include night storage electricity.  This will allow unused day-time units to be offset against the cost of night units and will enable pensioners with night storage heating to maximise their units.</P>
    <P>The free travel companion pass is being extended to all wheelchair users currently entitled to avail of free travel.  The payment of dependant allowance is being continued for six weeks after the death of an adult dependant.  In the case of a <Col N="1233" /> retirement pension, old age contributory and old age non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement allowance and invalidity pension, social welfare payments will be provided for six weeks after death.</P>
    <P>Moneylending is a major problem, especially at Christmas and other holiday periods.  An additional £250,000 is being provided to combat the problem of illegal moneylending, bringing the total allocation to £750,000.  This is most welcome. Such a scheme was introduced in Tralee and it certainly helped to break the back of illegal moneylending and that applies in many areas.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill also includes a new provision whereby the income unemployed people get from traditional activities, such as seaweed collection along the western seaboard, will be exempted from the means test.  Gathering seaweed has been part and parcel of life for generations along the sea coast. This new provision means that unemployed people can help to maintain an age old tradition in many communities and still keep their weekly payments.  I welcome also the new PRSI package which is aimed at generating new jobs and helping labour intensive industries to compete and boost take home pay for low paid workers.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Woods, who has shown that he is a caring Minister and has a special interest in the weaker sections of the community.  I appeal to him to continue in this vein as they need all the assistance they can get. Many of them are finding it had to make ends meet.</P>

      <P>He is a most effective administrator.  This Bill is not an exception in terms of the new measures introduced in a number of areas.  In recent years extraordinary sums of money have been spent on social welfare.  The figure amounts to approximately £3.8 billion or £3.9 billion.  There is a need for greater integration between the Departments of Social Welfare, Enterprise and Employment and Education.  This has been happening to some extent and there is now greater flexibility, particularly in the Department of Social Welfare, in relation to those who wish to pursue third level educational opportunities or the VTOS.  In addition, those who take part in the social employment or community employment schemes are allowed to retain secondary benefits.  This is welcome.</P>
      <P>The first experience of any young school leaver should not be the dole. It must be very demoralising for them having spent many years in school to have to sign on at the labour exchange.  The system should intervene to prevent this happening as it may have detrimental consequences.  Ideally, young people who cannot find sustainable employment immediately or who do not intend to pursue third level options should be facilitated either on a community employment scheme, an educational course or a training scheme.</P>
      <P>These schemes have been condemned recently but those who condemn them fail to take into account the positive psychological impact they can have on many young people.  The Department of Social Welfare is playing its role by allowing those who take part in these schemes to retain their secondary benefits such as a medical card.  I was delighted yesterday when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment announced at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs the commencement of the youth start programme, which is linked to the Department of Social Welfare, to provide meaningful opportunities for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of education many innovative measures have been introduced in <Col N="1235" /> recent years.  I pay tribute to the Minister for responding to Deputies who pointed out that people of all ages wanted to pursue second chance education. Because they were on social welfare their prospects of participating were hindered. The VTOS, for example, has been an extraordinary success with up to 3,000 people participating.  In Cork city hundreds of students at schools such as Scoil Stiofan Naofa, Scoil Eoin Naofa and the College of Commerce are participating in VTOS courses enabling them to reach their full potential, to do the leaving certificate or other specific courses under vocational programmes.</P>
    <P>There is room for further improvement. I know of a case where a young person who, when they found themselves unemployed, took part in a specific course under the VTOS and then pursued a further course at a third level institution but because they had received ESF funding several years ago they could not receive any further funding in respect of the third level course.  There is a need for greater integration, given that some of those who will take part in the VTOS will go on to pursue other courses at third level to obtain a diploma or degree. There is little point in whetting appetites if we do not, in consultation with the Department of Education, enable people to progress through the system to obtain a degree and provide them with the income support they require.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill and unemployment are linked.  The reduction in employer's PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent where an employee earns per week £173 or less represents the most significant breakthrough in a long time. I hope this will lead not alone to the preservation of existing jobs but also to job creation in labour intensive industries. For many years employer organisations have been arguing that the high rate of employer's PRSI is a major obstacle to employment creation.  We hope to see the benefits accruing from this reduction in employer's PRSI.</P>
    <P>A new two year employer's PRSI exemption scheme has been launched. <Col N="1236" /> The original scheme was not as successful as we had hoped.  This new scheme should be pursued vigorously by employers who should give it a chance.  In theory, it should prove to be a significant incentive particularly for small businesses to recruit more people on to the payroll.</P>
    <P>The increases in lone parent allowances are significant.  We commend the Minister who, despite the difficult economic conditions, has still managed to make improvements in many schemes. The survivor's pension, which is aimed at widowers and is an innovative measure, and the increases in invalidity pension, which now stands at the same rate as old age contributory pension, and child benefit are evidence of the Minister's commitment to increase household income for families on social welfare.</P>
    <P>This Bill is pro-family.  The Minister has always adopted a caring and compassionate philosophy towards large families in particular.  On the question of equality treatment, there has been much talk about the payment of arrears.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods has been Minister for Social Welfare for some time and is better versed than most in the intricacies of social welfare legislation and schemes.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system is a complex web of information about aspects of social welfare legislation and social welfare schemes, and is very confusing. The Minister made genuine attempts to inform the public by producing clear leaflets on many of the schemes, which is helpful.  However, it is regrettable that there is such a range of social welfare schemes.  The Minister referred to a new survivor's pension, even the terms are confusing.</P>
      <P>I want to mention a number of anomalies I often come up against.  A line of an old song ran: &ldquo;Maids when you're young never wed an old man&rdquo;.  The implications of the free telephone rental scheme are that one should marry only people within a certain age limit.  Unless a person is incapacitated, he cannot avail of the free telephone rental scheme if his spouse is not eligible for an old age pension.  People resort to going to a medical doctor for certification that they are incapacitated when they are not.  If a couple have lived together for years, and one has reached pension age and the other has not, and it is obvious that the marriage will continue, they should be entitled to avail of the free telephone rental scheme.  The scheme is beneficial because the telephone is a means of contact with others.  People appreciate their telephone rental being paid by the State. However, some are ruled out on the grounds of age of a spouse.  The Minister should look at this question and consider making the age of the spouse irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of young people applying for unemployment assistance, board and lodgings are assessed against them and they are told that if they move out of <Col N="1238" /> their parents' house and into a two-bit flat or a kitchenette they will get their social welfare benefits and rent allowance. This means that family units are being dissipated.  Of course there is a value in living in one's parents' house, but it is not really a monetary value; it is a family value, a sign of solidarity, a social value, an Irish value.  Young people should not be forced to break up families and move into a flat which may be damp and lead to all sorts of other consequences. This assessment against board and lodgings is wrong.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance scheme has great potential.  It is called a carer's allowance because the allowance is paid to the person who cares for somebody in need of care and attention.  Changes in this have benefited people but I know of one case that was turned down on the basis of the husband's income.  The wife is caring on a full-time basis for an elderly lady who is doubly incontinent and confined to a wheelchair.  The wife cares for this elderly patient on a 24-hour basis with no assistance but, because her husband is a PAYE worker earning over the limit, no allowance can be paid to her.  If it was not for the love these people have for that elderly person, she would be shoved into an institution.  There might be a subvention paid under the new regulations but the natural bond of caring for our elderly folk would then be broken.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance scheme does not recognise the value of the love of one's kith and kin.  Why should an elderly person not be looked after in the home of a son or daughter and given the care that can be supplied there?  Surely the person who does the caring deserves an allowance irrespective of what the husband earns?  Such care is provided not just on a one-hourly basis or two or three times a day, it is a 24-hour service.  The pain one sees in such an elderly person's eyes is caused in part by the fact that the State does not give an allowance to the son or daughter doing the caring. Obviously, the carer's allowance is a cost on the State but one cannot put a cost on human care and concern for kith and kin.  Several thousands such families may <Col N="1239" /> watch this on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and agree I am making a valid point.  If the carer's allowance was intended for people looking after patients in a caring capacity those people should be given an appropriate allowance, some recognition of the love, care, effort and toil they expend.  I know of instances where people have to buy incontinence pads, bandages, etc., because they have been taken off the health board roll.</P>
    <P>The health boards do the best they can by providing home helps who call in for an hour or two but the point is that the people doing the caring do not get recognition for the genuine efforts they make to provide love, comfort, care and consolation for the elderly in the last years of their lives when they most need it.</P>
    <P>While nursing homes and long stay institutions provide good care the sad faces of elderly people tell the real story. Most of them are removed from their homes because they do not have anyone to care for them.  If the carer's allowance scheme was implemented to its full potential most of those people could be taken care of in their homes and as a result would be happier.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we discussed the robberies that were taking place on a big scale in rural Ireland.  Recently a constituent of mine sought my advice on his application for an old age pension.  In the course of our discussion I asked him if he had any money in the bank because he would be asked a similar question when being assessed for his pension.  He produced an old style sugar bag containing £9,000 which he kept in his house.  He wanted to know if he would qualify for an old age pension with that amount of money &ldquo;under his oxter&rdquo;, as they say in the country.  I will not tell the Minister the result of his application but I want to make the point that a great deal of cash is still kept in jugs, dressers and boxes in houses around the country.  People need to be frequently reminded of how much money they can have in the bank or post office without their old age pension being reduced.  The limit is approximately £6,000 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> As thousands of people still keep large amounts of money in their houses there is a possibility of a recurrence of the type of robberies to which I referred.  In many cases elderly people were beaten up during those robberies and others were inveigled into giving money to bogus charities, salespersons and so on.  People should be informed of the 10 per cent incentive proposal in the budget.  It means a great deal to people to have a nest egg on deposit in a financial institution for a rainy day or to cover the cost of burial and they need the comfort of the Minister's authorisation to allay their fears.</P>
    <P>Recently an undertaker produced £900 in cash to me and said it was given to him by a person to cover the cost of a funeral. The cash was made up of the old £10 and £20 notes which were dated between the years 1950 and 1954.  That undertaker told me that in his locality a large number of elderly people keep that type of what is called dry cash in boxes in their houses. The Bishop's Crusade for Survival identified that up to £30 million was kept on deposit or in &ldquo;dry cash&rdquo; by the residents of a small town in the north-west region. That is a colossal amount of money in an area deemed to be impoverished and disadvantaged.  With our increasing elderly population people's savings and their money generally should be safeguarded and the elderly should not be fearful that if they place it on deposit in a post office, bank or other financial institution their old age pension will be reduced by, say, £10 or £15 per week because their means has increased.  Our elderly people should be encouraged in that regard.  Will the Minister indicate why the level was set at 10 per cent?</P>
    <P>The proposal to means test widow's contributory pensions would have had serious consequences.  I do not know which element of the Government proposed that measure.  I am glad to say that following pressure from the Fine Gael Party and other organisations the proposal was withdrawn, but when such an issue is voiced once, particularly in Government circles, there is a tendency to introduce it at some future date.  Many <Col N="1241" /> women will be widowed and if introduced such means testing would have had serious consequences for hundreds of thousands of people in the future and would probably have been the thin end of the wedge in respect of taxing and means testing other benefits.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government recognised the folly of what it was trying to do because the savings which would have accrued from it would not have been worth the distress, pressure and deep sense of outrage people would have felt in regard to it.  It is outrageous to think that people might pay into a contributory pension scheme during their working years and at the stroke of a pen or as a result of a Government decision would be means tested on that pension.  Such people would see that as a real injustice inflicted on them by the State and in this case by a Government with the largest majority in the history of the State.  I would describe it as a vampire tax, driving a stake through the heart of people's right to save money for later years.  That measure would have been a grave injustice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State described those benefits as perks, but she can answer for herself.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Woods, will tell us that the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; have been finally interred or cremated. Reference was made to the dirty dozen and the nasty nine and I am sure some people are at a loss to know what they are.  The Minister should settle the issue once and for all and categorically state that the dirty dozen have been abolished, and, unlike Lazarus, will never rise again.</P>
    <P>Many of the social welfare schemes are beneficial, but it is regrettable that they had to be introduced in the first place.  It is sad that the number out of work is heading for 400,000 and that we have such high social welfare expenditure.  If our economic situation improved to the extent that jobs were being created and the tax position was such that employers found it easy to recruit people, there would be an inflow of immigrants from the United States and England who would keep the level of unemployment in the range of the present level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> I hope the Minister will address the points I raised on some aspects of social welfare schemes which grate on people's minds and prove a hindrance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Kenny, referred to the dirty dozen social welfare cuts.  The package of 34 measures contained in the Bill outlined by the Minister in his speech last night not only buries the dirty dozen but restores the <i>status quo</i> that prevailed before those cuts or in many cases improves the position.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to discuss this on Committee Stage which will be dealt with by the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  There will be time to examine the various proposals in detail.</P>
      <P>The package of social welfare proposals contained in the Bill is the best I have seen during my 12 years in the House.  They probably represent the greatest move forward in social welfare legislation since the time my former colleague and Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Cluskey, was Minister for Social Welfare.  I am pleased those measures have been brought forward at a time when my party is a partner in Government. Those measures reflect the influence of my party and are ones for which we argued in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when I had the privilege of being Opposition spokesperson on social welfare for approximately seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we were concerned about the introduction of the 1 per cent levy.  My party leader, Deputy Spring, indicated that the Labour Party viewed it as a temporary measure and that it should be a once off proposition.  I welcome the decision of the Government and the Minister to remove the levy.  The Bill proposes not only removing that levy but removing the training and health levies for lower paid workers and that is a bonus.  Levies tend to be introduced on <Col N="1243" /> a so-called temporary basis, but they become permanent fixtures and become part of the overall tax take, of which the PAYE sector pay the bulk.  If such levies are introduced in the future for a specific purpose they should be removed when they have completed their function.  The proposals in the Bill are a serious attempt to deal with levies in such a manner.</P>
    <P>The main problem in respect of certain categories of social welfare recipients has yet to be tackled.  It can be dealt with under regulations.  I appeal to the Minister to address the problems faced by various workers, such as casual, short-time and part-time workers.  There is much confusion regarding the social welfare code.  It has become complicated and very few Members, not to mention the public, understand the system.  Many times when I spoke as Opposition spokesperson on social welfare very few, if any, members of the media understood the system.  The most complicated section of the social welfare system relates to the categories of casual, short-time and part-time workers.  The Minister will deal with this matter by the introduction of regulations. He might indicate on Committee Stage how he will tackle some of the problems facing those workers.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks 20 young workers in a large store in my town were working two hours a day.  Their employer told them there was no point in taking them off short-time working because they would not qualify for social welfare benefit. I began work in the footwear industry and at the time the industry was subject to seasonal influences and a shortage of work between seasons.  It was generally accepted by the unions and the employers that the system would be arranged so that some workers would work three days and sign on for social welfare benefits for the other days.  That work sharing measure in regard to which the Department of Social Welfare contributed ensured that people were not taken out of work on a permanent basis which would have reduced the labour force or contributed to the creation of casual and temporary workers.  It was <Col N="1244" /> better for people to work three days and sign on for social welfare benefits rather than be taken out of work and lose their social welfare benefits.  Those employees continued to pay their social welfare contribution.  If their earnings were higher than their tax free allowances they paid a small amount of tax.  There was a balance within the system.</P>
    <P>A group of dockers in my constituency who were casual workers were involved in a High Court case.  The High Court ruled in favour of the dockers and the Department had to pay a substantial amount of money in arrears of payment which had accrued over four and a half years.  Panic measures were taken and a set of regulations was introduced which was so confusing that the officials in the local and regional employment exchanges did not understand them.  A special section had to be set up in the Department to explain to the officials how to operate the new system.  A second set of regulations was introduced which was more confusing than the first.  Those regulations have been in place since that time.  The previous year's earnings of casual and short-time workers are taken into account in means testing.  Officials of the Department may say to such workers that they earned £5,000 to £10,000 last year and that they should have enough money to provide for themselves during periods of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that a worker who has done well in his job, earning a couple of hundred pounds a week, and who is let go, whether due to weather or conditions in the plant, is means tested on the basis of his previous year's earnings. There is no logic in that.  The whole question of means testing people on casual or part-time work should be considered because of great hardship is caused to these people.  The social welfare officers at local level are like FBI agents checking up on what people are doing.  This is clogging up the system and creating major problems.</P>
    <P>When people look for assistance from community welfare officers they too must carry out similar investigations before making payment.  There is much to-ing <Col N="1245" /> and fro-ing between the social welfare office and the community welfare office and neither office knows what the other is doing.  The Department cannot pay arrears due until it receives a report from the community welfare officer.  I cannot understand why temporary payments made by community welfare officers are made through the Department of Health rather than the Department of Social Welfare.  This does not make sense.  It is a cumbersome system and is very expensive to administer.  This whole area needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to means testing as it relates to young people who are being forced out of their homes.  The Minister said previously he was having this matter investigated.  At present houses in urban areas are occupied by young people who would not be entitled to social welfare payment if they stayed at home.  Some of these people are renting houses and not living in them.  The system is forcing them to become dishonest, leading to all sorts of social problems.  The social welfare officer must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the young person is living at the address specified.  Not alone are parents investigated, but if the young person goes to live with an uncle, aunt or grandparent, that person has to present information as to their means, whether it be a P60 or P45 form, pension returns or mortgage receipts.  This system needs to be improved.  The regulations applied by the Department of Social Welfare encourage young people to mix with bad company and to become involved in drugs as it takes them away from parental control in the family home.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of the provisions in the Bill such as the introduction of an additional £10 for single people on unemployment assistance.  This measure is long overdue.  Single people pay similar overhead costs in running a home as do two people living together.  In many cases these people are living on the bread line and find it very difficult to exist.  I welcome the provision which brings into line invalidity and old age pension.  The increase of £10.20 is very generous and is well above inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I also welcome the reduction in PRSI payments in labour intensive industries. Many industries such as the clothing, footwear and textile industries have suffered substantial job losses.  In my town seven clothing and footwear factories and two textile factories closed down and nothing was done to assist them.  This is the first positive move to assist these industries and I hope that trend will continue. These indigenous industries employ many young people, male and female, and have made a tremendous contribution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the lower paid in terms of health contributions and training levies.  I hope in future budgets that policy will be continued and that payment of these levies will be eliminated altogether.  It is unacceptable that training levies must be paid when we are getting a substantial amount of European funds for this purpose.  The European Union has stated that we are spending too much money on training, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The increase of £6 in the family income supplement is welcome.  I am always amazed at the number of people who are not aware of this scheme.  I suggested previously that the application for family income supplement should be included in the tax return application.  Many people on low pay with families are not aware that they qualify for substantial payments from this scheme.  Some method should be devised to inform them of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>The measure which provides for equal treatment of widows and widowers is a major step forward and is long overdue. I particularly welcome the 10 per cent increase in unemployment benefit and disability benefit which is well ahead of inflation and exceeds many of the increases under the new national agreement. This is the first clear indication that we are serious about improving the lot of the lower paid and disadvantaged.  I am pleased the Labour Party in Government has played a part in these improvements.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and Minister of State on bringing forward the best package of social welfare proposals that <Col N="1247" /> has come before this House since the late Frank Cluskey was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Social Welfare Bill is a major item in the annual calendar of the Dáil.  The huge budget for social welfare is an indication of the times in which we live, rising unemployment and an older population.  For every ten people working and contributing to the Exchequer 23 people are dependent on social welfare.  It can be seen, therefore, that social welfare is of vital importance to almost every family. In view of the size of the budget which the Minister has to administer every year, it is critically important that social welfare benefits are streamlined and tailored to meet the requirements of those in greatest need.  A social welfare system will do nothing for society if it does not alleviate poverty in the areas where it is most harrowing.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for seven years but until now it has never been within my brief to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  There have been vast improvements in the delivery and administration of the service since the Minister, Deputy Woods, took over responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare.  I know this from dealings with my constituents in my clinics week after week. Credit must be given to the Minister for the hard work he has put into making the system more streamlined, accessible and transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of everybody and the large budget for social welfare, there is still hard and grinding poverty in our society.  This has been caused in the main by long term unemployment which has settled over this country like a dark cloud and is refusing to go away.  There is a huge level of poverty in many families, particularly in families with a large number of children.  I want to refer to the harrowing level of poverty among children and the distress and difficulties this creates for their parents, particularly for women, the managers of budgets and <Col N="1248" /> referees between the conflicting demands of the various members of their families. There is enormous poverty in families where the income is too low to meet even the most basic outgoings.  I will come back to this point later.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an issue which was raised yesterday and on a number of previous occasions and raised by me by way of a Private Notice Question to the Minister on 18 February 1993, that is, the equality payments due to women.  This is one of the most contentious and controversial social welfare issues.  Women know from their experience that their entitlements in law are being withheld from them month after month and, at this stage, year after year.  I am talking about equality payments, particularly the alleviation payments which remain to be dealt with and disposed of.  It is appalling that women are being forced to take expensive legal action and employ solicitors to advance rights and entitlements which they should automatically receive from Government sources.  My colleague, Deputy Allen, who has been working on this issue for a long time, knows exactly about what I am speaking. This is a huge issue in Cork city, which I represent, where women are being forced to hire solicitors to establish their entitlements and make a case which will eventually force the Department to make the payments.  It is totally unacceptable that women should have to go to this expense to obtain basic information which should automatically be given to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by sheltering behind the fact that this matter is in the courts, is only prolonging the uncertainty and the day when this matter will have to be confronted.  This is generating much mistrust among women.  They need this money now.  If they were farmers or vintners and were represented by a powerful trade union or pressure group with strong and articulate spokespersons or were part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or some other agreement, their needs and demands would have been met by now.  Because they do not have this kind of support or the strength which comes from being organised, their <Col N="1249" /> claims are being put on the long finger and ignored, thus prolonging their grievance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should confront this problem.  I am asking him to do two things in this regard.  First, he should inform women as to the exact amounts due and, second, set out a schedule of payments.  If women were told they would be paid within six, 12 or even 18 months I think they would settle for that. The Minister should tell those thousands of women whose claims are still outstanding that he acknowledges the legitimacy of their claims, that X amount of money is due and he will meet the demands for that money within a specified period.  That is the kind of basic information to which these women are entitled.  I appeal to the Minister to respond to this request.</P>
    <P>Approximately 500 women in Cork city are awaiting payments of this money. If they were farmers, vintners or trade unionists they would not be required to wait this long for payment.  Their legitimate claims would have been acknowledged, they would have been informed of the amounts due and told when the payments would be made.</P>

      <P>His Department ought to know the number of such women.  Even if his Department does not know the number, a number of solicitors know it and are making money out of it.  Many women who are awaiting payment know it.  This is a very important issue which will simply not go away.  Talking around the problem will not solve it.  The matter must be addressed; women must be informed of their entitlements and the timeframe for the payments will have to be set out clearly.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister in relation to this contentious issue.  Women are now more aware of their rights in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> I have already referred to poverty affecting families, particularly those with young children.  The Minister announced an increase of £5 for the third and £2 for each subsequent child.  That is little more than a gesture as 60 per cent of all children living in poverty are in families with three children or more.  This is where the real pockets of poverty exist; families with three, four or five children on low incomes which it is not possible to stretch to cover the outgoings in any given week. Young people come home every day from school requesting money for books, shoes, games and other extras.  The obligation is usually on the mother to meet the cost of food, heating and clothing, the basic necessities, and she must balance the family budget.  There is harrowing poverty among large families with resultant pressures on parents, particularly mothers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address this issue, particularly in subsequent budgets, because this is where real poverty exists and where the future of young people is determined.  Young people living in homes with this degree of poverty seldom rise above it and are getting a poor start in life.  Child benefit should be paid in a graded way because, as young people become adolescents, the cost of caring for them increases.  It does not make economic sense to give the same rate of child benefit to an infant and an 11, 12 or 13 year old.  There should be a scale where the amount of benefit increases as the child gets older.  When young people reach the age of 9, 10 and 11, a time of maximum expense, the amount of child benefit would increase in accordance with the age of the child.  The Minister should address himself to this area.</P>
    <P>Women with children in that age group are invariably driven to borrowing money for one reason or another.  Even the best managers, who balance their budgets in a manner that no Minister could, find it difficult when an illness arises or when there is a First Holy Communion, a Confirmation, a birthday or any other occasion that puts an additional expense on the weekly budget.  Such occurrences <Col N="1252" /> put the whole budget out of kilter and that is when people are driven to moneylenders. If we are serious about keeping women out of their clutches we must direct more child benefit to poorer homes.  It is counter-productive to give money to people at a later stage to help them pay their debts and prevention is the key.  We should allocate sufficient money by way of child benefit to these families to enable them to live within their budgets and not drive them into the hands of moneylenders.  That is the type of strategy that necessitated the Minister allocating more than £100 million from the social welfare budget this year to health boards because they have not been in a position to balance their budgets for years.  That money should have been given to poor families with large numbers of children.  I acknowledge that the Minister had little option in this regard but the situation should not have been allowed to develop to that extent.  The money should have been spent on trying to eliminate poverty among children but it was used to bail out the health boards and to cover bad management, bad practice and bad accountancy over the years.  I resent that and I hope it will not happen again.</P>
    <P>No country would allow a large percentage of its children to live in such extreme poverty and give so many of them such a poor start in life.  This should not happen; we pay high taxes and our social welfare budget is sufficiently high. I appeal to the Minister to further streamline the system and to provide better benefits for large families.  We should aim at least to give all our children a reasonable and fair start in life.  We should be more conscious of and sensitive to the anguish of young mothers trying to cope with the demands of raising young children on low incomes.  Many of them run up large health bills.  It would make good political, economic and social sense to direct more moneys to these families.</P>
    <P>In regard to women who are having difficulty obtaining places on the new community employment schemes, what steps will the Minister take to increase access for women to those schemes?  In many cases they are not signing on for <Col N="1253" /> historical reasons and under the present criteria they appear not to be eligible to participate in community employment schemes.  In the recent budget 1,000 places on those schemes were announced.  The Minister should examine this issue and see what changes can be made in social welfare terms to enable women to avail of their rightful share of places on those schemes.  The kind of exclusion from that and other schemes is a key cause of the build-up of poverty among women and keeping them in continuous poverty.  There are now a number of very good self-help groups in every constituency nationwide &mdash; especially in my constituency in Cork city.  A number of extremely well motivated family support groups and centres have one aim only, to help women to lift themselves out of poverty traps.  This would entail very little assistance from the Government, but a change is necessary in the social welfare requirements.  Access to such schemes is one way &mdash; although there are a number of others &mdash; in which women can be aided in helping themselves which is all they seek.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Moffatt and Leonard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate.  I congratulate the Minister on his continued innovative approach to the administration of our social services.  The main provisions of this Bill, namely, the increase in the weekly rates of payment applicable to different schemes, the extension of such schemes and, in particular, the introduction of the new survivor's pension, plus a substantial improvement in the carer's allowance, represent very welcome developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of people in receipt of benefit or payment from the Department of Social Welfare, 822,000, and their 627,000 dependants, indicate in no uncertain terms the wide-ranging nature of the operations of the Department and the amount of families and homes dependent on the administration of the social welfare services in an orderly and customer-friendly manner.  Over the years the <Col N="1254" /> Minister has striven constantly to streamline the workings of his Department, resulting in substantial improvements in recent years.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill demonstrate the Government's commitment to the maintenance and safeguarding of the position of those dependent on social welfare.  I welcome a number of initiatives in the Bill that deal with issues constantly brought to our attention by constituents, especially the proposed improvement in the carer's allowance, the reduction in employers' PRSI contributions and the continuation of certain secondary social welfare benefits to people wishing to participate in community employment or educational schemes.  In addition, the introduction of the new survivor's contributory pension for widowers represents a major leap in terms of social insurance cover and places Ireland in the forefront of our European Union partners in providing equal treatment for men and women who lose their spouses.  The value of this new measure for over 9,000 widowers and their families can be guaged from the fact that it will represent an overall payment of £27.5 million to them and their families at a time of great grief.  I am delighted that Fianna Fáil in Government have introduced this vital new scheme, representing a major step towards greater financial security for families where the wife dies.  For the first time widowers will be enabled to claim a contributory pension on the same basis as their widow counterparts.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is important that the entitlements of the 85,000 widows in receipt of contributory widow's pension are not affected by the introduction of this new survivor's pension.  My understanding is that, from October next, all new widows and widowers will qualify for eligibility based either on their own or their late spouse's PRSI record.  The automatic payment of a pension to everybody who qualifies will be of enormous benefit to widowers who previously received no financial support on the death of their spouse.  I hope the Minister and his Departmental staff will provide <Col N="1255" /> the relevant explanatory leaflets and application forms in respect of this important new scheme without delay. The predicament in which a widower and his young family can find themselves was forcefully brought home to me over the weekend when I was approached by a widower whose wife had been tragically killed in a car accident, leaving three school-going children.  The man's small farmers' unemployment assistance claim had been approved, awarding him an extremely small payment.  Following such heartbreak it should be patently obvious to social welfare officers that a survivor in these circumstances would not be able to derive maximum benefit from such a small holding or farm of poor quality, while caring for his children.  I hope that the payment of the survivor's pension will directly address the needs of people experiencing such hardship.</P>
    <P>All Members will be aware of the enormous benefits individuals and communities derived from the various social employment schemes.  Thankfully, the Government decided to expand their range considerably, combining those and other schemes with the new community employment programme.  One of the major drawbacks to the proper development of such social employment schemes in some areas was the feared potential loss of secondary social welfare benefits in the case of people who wished to participate in them.  For example, the potential loss of a medical card seemed to be one of the most serious reservations of people who wished to participate in such schemes.  The continuation of secondary benefits for people who move from social welfare benefits to participation in a community employment programme is essential and will represent a valued improvement in the administration of FAS schemes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 3 per cent increase in the carer's allowance.  The Minister has effected a welcome improvement by means of disregarding earnings of £100 in respect of working spouses.  I know that the Minister will continue to work on improving that very valuable allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffat</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for having shared his time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this Bill giving legal effect to increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget.  The Bill breaks new ground in many ways in social welfare thinking and dovetails with the Government's objectives of giving greater incentives to people to return to work in addition to the creation of jobs.  At the same time it represents a caring attitude to society, especially to those less well off, who may be suffering from illnesses, post-accident symptoms or those generally unable to work.</P>
      <P>Section 16 is applicable to the carer's allowance in respect of which the disregarding of the first £100 of earnings by a spouse is greatly welcomed.  It constitutes a step in the right direction and will help many families nationwide, affording them the possibility of caring for their elderly relatives at home.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this overall area at a future date and consider disregarding all income when deciding eligibility for the allowance.  In this respect he may have to consult his colleague, the Minister for Health.  I have no doubt that the right place in which the elderly should be cared for is at home with their own people.  The provisions of section 18 stipulate a number of improvements in the means test for the purpose of eligibility under social welfare schemes.  I especially welcome the exemption of activities such as the collection of seaweed along our western coast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided to proceed with the initiative of public service management that I announced on Tuesday last on the basis that we need change in the public service so that we can respond to the economic and social challenges we are facing.  Our partnership Government provides the stability that gives us an opportunity to make worthwhile change.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that each Secretary and Head of Office will put in place a process of strategic management, within the framework of the Programme for a Partnership Government, the National Development Plan and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>Each will produce, as a first step, an action oriented statement of strategy. These statements will outline where Departments should be strategically to meet the objectives of the Programme for Partnership Government, the National Development Programme and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, as opposed to where they currently are and how they will achieve the change required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided, also, that a new co-ordinating group of secretaries will recommend management changes, including legislation, if such is needed.  These changes will be designed to enable individual secretaries to manage more efficiently and effectively <Col N="1259" /> given the conflicting needs of overall control and line responsibility.  In this regard, the proposals in the draft public service pay agreement in regard to restructuring will provide an opportunity within the necessary financial parameters for public service management and public service unions to work together to agree change in structure and work practices for the mutual benefit of both parties.</P>
    <P>The group will also recommend the ways in which interacting departmental strategies should be co-ordinated to achieve the benefits of an overall view.</P>
    <P>The statements of strategy and the positions produced by the co-ordinating group of secretaries will, of course, be for ministerial and Government decision in every case.  Work on the new initiative will build on but probably must go well beyond action already underway.  This action includes changes in the structures of Government Departments and agencies; the new system of programme managers; work by Departments, principally the Departments of Social Welfare and Health and the Revenue Commissioners, on customer service; networks at assistant secretary and principal levels and the administrative budget system.  The new service-wide initiative will add momentum to these actions.</P>
    <P>The three key areas to be addressed in the new strategy process are the contribution public bodies can make to national development; providing an excellent service to the public and making efficient and effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>I see strategies being developed for all public bodies, be they Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  I see the important first steps being in place in six months.  The entire process must be based on two key principles.  Management must know what needs to be changed and the change must come from within.</P>
    <P>The issue of joint ventures between the public and private sectors and the public sector taking a commercial approach are important options in the process of public bodies making a substantial contribution <Col N="1260" /> to national development.  Worthwhile opportunities can be identified for such joint ventures or commercial approaches and I believe these can happen in a variety of ways with varying levels of formality. For example, a joint working party representative of the Department of Finance and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will shortly bring forward proposals to update Government financial procedures, including greater flexibility for quasi-commercial operations within Departments. There will be action which is fully consistent with the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government that the main strategic utilities and enterprises remain in the ownership of the Irish people while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private and co-operative sectors.  My objective is to ensure the opportunities which exist are seriously considered by public bodies as options when they come to assess how they can strengthen significantly their contribution to national development.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he envisages in this package of public service reform a change in the traditional role of Ministers and their accountability to the House and if so, would it require legislation?  Will the additional autonomy given to secretaries of Departments recently, in terms of administrative budgets, be extended?  Does he envisage, as part of this reform, that the pay restraints on chief executives of State companies and other bodies within the remit of Gleeson &mdash; the last person in charge of higher remuneration in the public service review body &mdash; will be altered, removed or discounted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one sentence to each of the supplementaries I wish to put.  Will the Taoiseach reply to the question of pay restraint in the public sector for chief executives?  In the specific area mentioned in the Programme for Government can we expect the emergence of a third banking force in the Irish economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a third banking force is being worked on by the Minister for Finance and no doubt he will bring forward his proposals in due course.  In regard to reform, the Deputy has missed the point in what I have been trying to say today.  We have asked the head of every Government Department to come up with a strategic plan, within six months, for his own area of responsibility. As Deputy Rabbitte is aware, the question of pay is dealt with through existing structures.  We await proposals from various Departments to improve <Col N="1267" /> the system.  As of now there is no change in the pay structures for public servants.</P>

The Declaration sets out a framework of principles and realities within which the two Governments believe that a lasting political solution of the Northern Ireland problem can be found.  It has achieved very widespread support, including across both communities in Northern Ireland and in both islands.  I would like to see talks building on that solid and valuable foundation.  I believe they should focus clearly on the need for a deep and comprehensive settlement which would give practical and institutional expression to the principles articulated in the Declaration and produce new and satisfactory arrangements across all three strands.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on the timing and conditions for talks is clear and consistent: We are ready to enter talks as soon as a basis for them has been agreed among the participants.  For our part we are anxious to do so as soon as possible and without preconditions of any description.</P>
    <P>Public opinion on this island, North and South, has signalled in the most unmistakable terms, its support for the resumption of dialogue between the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties.  The majority of people of both traditions want to see their elected representatives sit down around the negotiating table and hammer out an agreement.</P>
    <P>We have made clear at all times that we regard the peace process and the talks process as complementary.  It is of course obvious that the prospects for negotiating a just and lasting settlement would be greatly enhanced in a climate free of violence or the threat of violence.</P>
    <P>We hope that the republican movement will pay heed to the clear message coming to them from the Irish people of all traditions and open a way for comprehensive negotiations in an atmosphere of peace.  At the same time, we have made it abundantly clear that no group will be allowed to exercise a veto on political progress.</P>
    <P>There are recent indications that the <Col N="1272" /> Unionist parties are retreating more and more from the position they agreed in the March 26 statement, and reverting to the pursuit of an internal settlement.</P>
    <P>The position of all other parties in the talks process, and indeed the experience of Northern Ireland itself, suggests that such an internal strategy is unlikely to command much interest or support in any other quarter.  Its most likely result will be to marginalise the role and influence of the leaders of the unionist community, at a time which could be of considerable importance for the future of this island.</P>
    <P>I think that is regrettable and I hope that the leaders of the unionist tradition will reflect very carefully on their position. Their rightful place is at the negotiating table.  Recent opinion polls suggest that that is where their own electorate, as well as the two Governments, wish to see them.  I will continue to pursue the goal of constructive political dialogue with leaders of the Unionist community in every way open to me.  It is of course ultimately the responsibility of the two Governments to achieve the kind of political progress which will bring lasting peace and stability.</P>
    <P>We are in regular contact with the British Government on the prospects for a resumption of political talks.  Preparatory work on this issue is proceeding at official level.  I had detailed discussions with Sir Patrick Mayhew on how best to advance the process, and I shall be continuing this work at an informal meeting to be held shortly, and at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    <P>The best chance of securing a successful outcome to talks lies, in our judgment, in preserving the confidentiality of our exchanges.  I do not believe it would be helpful, accordingly, if I were to make public the details of proposals which we may put forward or may receive.  The Government of course remain fully committed to Article 4 (c), as we do to all other provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>There was and is no question of a suspension of the Anglo-Irish Conference to accommodate talks.  The question of whether the Government might again be <Col N="1273" /> willing to adjust the schedule of Conference meetings in this context is a matter for discussion between the two Governments if and when a basis for new talks is agreed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of new talks, as the Taoiseach made clear in his address to the Irish Association on 10 January, is to achieve agreement among the people of Ireland.  We wish to see renewed dialogue, starting from the Joint Declaration and leading, in the words of the Declaration, to &ldquo;a new political framework founded on consent and encompassing arrangements within Northern Ireland for the whole island and between these islands&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree it is regrettable that there has been a political vacuum in Northern Ireland for the last 15 months in that there has been no forum or mechanism whereby constitutional parties who do not and have never used violence can talk to one another about their common future? What did the Tánaiste mean when he said that the Irish Government was ready to enter into talks as soon as a basis for them is agreed between the participants? Does that mean that one or more of the participants by withholding agreement can veto the commencement of the talks?</P>

      <P>It is in everybody's interest that there should be a political initiative on Northern Ireland available at all times.  Nobody wants to see the constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland not being in a position to contribute to political life in Northern Ireland.  As I made clear in my reply and in many public statements since assuming office, the Irish Government is anxious to resume dialogue on Northern Ireland, to seek talks resuming and to see the constitutional process engaged in.  It is regrettable that that has not proved possible in the course of the last 12 months. We will continue with our efforts.  We are ready, willing and available and it is in everybody's interest that the more people we can bring to those talks the better.  The wider the consensus one can establish on <Col N="1274" /> the need for talks and on the outcome of the talks the better are the prospects of having a successful outcome.  At the same time, no individual or party has a veto on the resumption of talks.  Both Governments are working towards a framework to set out a prospect for talks.</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that it is desirable that talks should be started before the European election campaign gets into high gear so that parties in Northern Ireland do not say things in the course of campaigning which will make the resumption of talks after the election more difficult, that it is desirable that we have at least some point of contact established between them even if relatively little progress can be made before the election, so as to moderate the potentially divisive language that may be used in the campaign in the absence of such a point of contact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in agreeing with that suggestion.  It is extremely important that the prospects for talks should be developed and that both Governments would find themselves in a position to outline the ingredients necessary for talks to resume.  The Government has welcomed the generally careful and constructive line taken by the Official Unionists in relation to the Declaration.  I sincerely hope that electoral considerations will not promote any modification of that line.  The prize of peace which the declaration holds out is far too important to be exploited for party political manoeuvring in the context of European elections.</P>

      <P>Does he agree that the document published by the Official Unionist Party does not of itself reject the three-strand talks, but that it was rejected in an off the cuff reply to a question at a press conference? Does he further agree that it would be very foolish of the Official Unionist Party, from the point of view of their own constituents and everybody on the island, to reject the three-strand approach because <Col N="1275" /> it is the only one that accurately reflects all the dimensions to the problem?  It is very important that the Government uses every contact to dissuade the Official Unionist Party from going down a political <i>cul-de-sac,</i> to use the apt words of the Taoiseach if it is unwilling to accept Strands II and III.  Will he agree it would be useful to table proposals on Strands II and III because there is a feeling in Northern Ireland &mdash; I know this from talks I had with politicians there &mdash; that the Irish Government is not really serious about Strands II and III because it has not tabled proposals on them?  If the Government did so, it would indicate a measure of seriousness that some suspect &mdash; although I believe they are inaccurate &mdash; is absent.</P>

      <P>The remarks by Mr. Molyneaux on the publication of the document on Monday last were regrettable and very disappointing.  Over the past 12 months we have tried to build up a working relationship with the Unionist parties because of the important role which they will have in the future of this island.  I do not believe, and Deputy Bruton agrees, that a strictly internal narrow solution would or can work.  We have tried to make that very clear and to establish the Government's serious concern about a solution in Northern Ireland.  I believe the people of Northern Ireland want a solution to the conflict and the Irish Government will do everything possible, including handing over papers on our ideas on solutions to the problem, to make sure that the doubters among the Unionist community will have their doubts resolved.  Time and time again, I have said that the Unionist community has nothing to fear from working with the Dublin Government and I hope we can convince them of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 17, 28, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>A significant portion of my address to the General Assembly at its 48th session last autumn was devoted to the question of reform of the United Nations.  In my statement, I underlined the importance for the organisation of being able to meet the new challenges and demands that confront it, and pointed out that at no time in its history had the need to re-examine and strengthen the UN system been greater or more widely felt.  In reply to parliamentary questions on 7 October, I set out in some detail Ireland's objectives in the area of UN reform, in particular as it concerns the composition of the Security Council, the General Assembly, UN peacekeeping, human rights and UN financing.  Ireland was fully engaged in the consideration of these issues throughout the session and the delegation actively pursued the objectives outlined in my statement to the Assembly.</P>
      <P>Given their importance to the entire international community, and the requirement that any proposals for reform must be able to command widespread support in an organisation that comprises 185 sovereign states, it is inevitable that the process of agreed change on these questions will take time. I remain confident, however, that sufficient progress will be made during next year to enable important decisions affecting the future role of the UN to be taken in 1995, which marks the 50th anniversay of the UN.</P>
      <P>The area covered by UN reform is extensive and I will deal with the most important issues here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> In regard to the Security Council, Ireland supports an increase in its membership to enhance the Council's political authority and its capacity to act decisively and with confidence.  In view of the changes in international life since the Charter was drafted there is a good case for an increase in the permanent membership of the Council and I am considering whether this would best be met by extending the current form of permanent membership or by the establishment of a category of semi-permanent members.</P>
    <P>Ireland accepts that the veto accorded to each of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council is intrinsic to the system of international organisation established when the charter was drawn up in 1945.  The relevant provisions cannot be changed without the support of two-thirds of the members of the UN, including all the existing permanent members.  I am not convinced, however, that it would be desirable to extend the right to veto to other members as part of the current reform process.</P>
    <P>These are among the issues that will be taken up by a new open-ended working group which has been established by the General Assembly to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the Security Council's membership.  Ireland is a member of the working group and our Permanent Representative to the UN is actively taking part in its work.  I am fully aware of the degree of interest in the House on this important question and I intend to keep the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs informed of developments in the discussions in New York.</P>
    <P>Of course, the question of reform goes beyond the issue of the Security Council. The General Assembly too is engaged in a process of reform and revitalisation. Progress has been made in the rationalisation of agendas and in the restructuring of certain main committees of the Assembly.  In addition, the Assembly has asked the Secretary-General to implement specific measures for revitalising the role of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields starting in 1994.  Ireland supports this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> On the question of peace enforcement and peacekeeping, I consider that Chapters VI and VII of the UN Charter provide an adequate framework for UN operations and I do not feel that Charter amendment in these areas is an urgent necessity.  However, significant improvements can and should be made in the application of these provisions by the Security Council.  In particular Ireland is emphasising the need to maintain peace enforcement and peace-keeping operations within an overall political framework; the need for the Security Council to pay particular attention to issues of command and control; the need to improve military planning at UN Headquarters and the need to improve co-ordination with humanitarian and civilian aspects of peacekeeping operations both at UN headquarters and in the field.  In a Resolution co-sponsored by Ireland, the General Assembly has asked the Secretary-General to thoroughly review these areas and to take urgent steps to strengthen present arrangements.</P>
    <P>The safety and security of UN peace-keepers is a matter of particular concern. At the last session, we supported proposals to promote an international convention which would declare attacks on peacekeepers to be a criminal offence. An <i>ad hoc</i> committee has now been established to widen an international convention dealing with the safety and security of UN and associated personnel. Our delegation will be playing an active role in this committee, whose work is due to begin on 28 March.</P>
    <P>In the area of human rights, a major priority for Ireland was to have a post of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights established.  We were closely involved in all stages of the negotiations which were difficult at times.  In the end the proposal secured unanimous support and the Secretary-General's nominee as first UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was recently approved by the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The financial situation of the UN remains critical and I have continued to argue the need for all member states to <Col N="1280" /> pay their assessed contributions in full and on time.  Unless that obligation is complied with by the membership as a whole, the organisation will continue to experience severe difficulties in carrying out the many tasks assigned to it, some of which, particularly in the peace-keeping area, are extremely costly.  I will also continue to press for recovery of the arrears owing to Ireland by way of reimbursement for our participation in the UN operations in Lebanon and Cyprus, in respect of which we are currently owed around £11 million.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, 1995 marks the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the UN.  A number of countries, including Ireland, have announced their intention to establish national committees to prepare a suitable programme of activities to mark the anniversary, which also marks the 40th anniversary of Ireland's membership of the UN.  I propose to invite Members of the Oireachtas to participate in the Irish national committee, which will comprise representatives drawn from a variety of backgrounds.  I intend to make a further announcement about this question shortly.  While the committee will not have specific functions in the area of policy, proposals and ideas for reform which result from its work will, of course, receive careful consideration.</P>
    <P>In relation to advisory bodies that may from time to time be established abroad to address issues in the area of UN reform, I believe that suitably qualified Irish people can play a useful role if invited to participate in the work of such bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of policy matters from the Security Council, the General Assembly, peacekeeping, human rights to financing will have to be addressed and will keep many of the committees busy for a long time.  It can be difficult in a constituent body consisting of 185 sovereign governments to achieve consensus or an efficient working arrangement.  It can be a complex matter.  The Government will participate in the process leading up to the 50th anniversary celebrations.  Suggestions have been put forward about the Security Council and the General Assembly which are concerned to ensure that it will have a role in policy formulation.  The meetings of the General Assembly are addressed by each country and continue for a number of weeks.  This is a cumbersome process. Both the General Assembly and the membership of the Security Council are in need of review.  I hope the membership of the national committee will be representative and that it will consist of Members of the Oireachtas and others who are involved with the United Nations.  It is important that Ireland celebrates its membership of the United Nations and its 50th anniversary in a <Col N="1282" /> manner which reflects the service we have given to the United Nations and the important role it plays in pursuing a wide range of objectives.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that in the course of a long reply he did not, apart from saying that the permanent membership of the Security Council could be expanded, state a single concrete proposal for the reform of the United Nations?  Does he further agree that he has conceded the permanent membership is not the subject of any proposal from Ireland, in terms of changing its identity?  The post-colonial powers at the end of 1945 individually have a veto over Security Council resolutions. Has the Minister considered the possibility of reforming the Charter of the United Nations to provide that only two permanent members of the Security Council will have a veto?  Does he agree, given the emergence of the European Union onto the international playing field, that a different approach to permanent membership of the Security Council is required and it is no longer satisfactory that the United Kingdom and France are both permanent members?</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the veto.  During the years this has been a necessary instrument in relation to the United Nations Charter. Should it be abolished, for example?  This may not be a practical option in present circumstances.  The more general question of voting rights at the Security Council has to be considered in the context of procedural reform.  Although the veto has been abused in the past there is a positive aspect in that a resolution adopted by the Security Council will have the approval, if not the acquiescence, of all five permanent members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 23, 31, 42, 50 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland remains very concerned at reports of continuing human rights abuses in East Timor.  We condemn all such abuses and our concerns on this matter have been, and will continue to be, conveyed to the Indonesian Government at every appropriate opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was the case in 1992 and 1993, the <Col N="1285" /> question of human rights in East Timor is being debated at this year's session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which is currently meeting in Geneva.  This year, as in previous years, Ireland and our European Union partners are playing an active and leading role at the session in highlighting concerns about human rights abuses in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Relations between the European Union and Indonesia take place within the framework of the Union's relations with the ASEAN countries.  Human rights and development co-operation are central elements of this relationship and these questions are regularly addressed in the wide range of contacts between the Union and ASEAN.  In these discussions Ireland emphasises the importance of the strict observance of human rights in the context of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>We believe that the ongoing dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary General is the best way to resolve the question of the status of East Timor.  We have fully supported and will continue to support the Secretary General's efforts in this regard which we hope will lead to a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the country which supplies the greatest number of arms to Indonesia is the United Kingdom?  Have we protested to our nearest neighbour about its arms trade with Indonesia, given that these arms, including Hawk bombers, are used to oppress the people of East Timor?  Is the Minister aware that the Timor Gap, the narrow body of water between Indonesia and East Timor, has been exploited for its oil and other resources by Australia and Indonesia jointly?  International law as enunciated by the United Nations sets down that this body of water forms part of the territorial waters of East Timor.  Have we protested to Australia specifically and Indonesia about the exploitation of these resources which, if considered in the context of international <Col N="1286" /> law as enunciated by the United Nations, is illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of arms sales by the United Kingdom and other countries to Indonesia, it is a matter for the United Nations Security Council to decide whether there should be an international arms embargo.  Ireland will continue to advocate restraint in the interests of international peace and security and will do everything possible in that respect.  I am not aware if any protest has been made to Australia about these matters.  I have contacted the Indonesian foreign minister about human rights issues and have had a number of discussions with my Portuguese counterpart about the efforts he is making through the United Nations.  The best way to bring this difficult matter in East Timor to an end is through the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations with Indonesia and Portugal.  With our partners in the European Union we will do everything possible in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically asked the Minister if he was aware of the recent disclosure that after the Dili Cemetery massacre Indonesian soldiers killed some of the wounded people in their hospital beds.  If not, will he make himself aware of it and raise it with the Indonesian Government?  Will the Minister take more interest in this subject and lead the campaign in Europe to highlight the injustices and lack of human rights in East Timor and, if necessary, demand sanctions against Indonesia if they continue to massacre and mistreat the people of East Timor?  There is no point in continuing to do business with them when they get away with these abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the brutal savagery which was reported to us from East Timor and the Government condemns it.  The question of sanctions would have to be considered within the European Union, and it is my intention to make sure that it is.  The abuses of human rights in East Timor are unacceptable and we will do everything possible <Col N="1287" /> to ensure that this matter is high on the agenda because of the incidents the Deputy has mentioned.  The Government is deeply concerned at the situation in East Timor.  This has been brought to the attention of the Indonesian Government through diplomatic channels and I have written to the Indonesian foreign minister expressing my concern.  That will be repeated and we will condemn the out-rages in the most direct way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what prejudice, if any, the Indonesian Government has thus far suffered in its dealings with the European Union as a result of its annexation of East Timor?  What practical steps have there been to demonstrate the European Union's displeasure at the annexation of East Timor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot cite any incidence of prejudice against the Indonesian Government on the part of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My Portuguese colleague has raised the matter on many occasions and has received our unequivocal support. The matter has been raised at the United Nations.  The best prospect of bringing about a resolution is in the context of the discussions taking place in mediation by the Secretary General of the United Nations.  We should be giving every support to the Secretary General of the UN to ensure that a resolution can be found to this conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that he has not made any representations to the Australian Government?  Will he undertake to do so regarding their role in the continued oppression of the people of East Timor? In addition, has he raised within the <Col N="1288" /> CFSP of the European Union the matter of East Timor and, specifically, the sale of arms by members of the European Union to Indonesia which are being used for the slaughter that is taking place there?  Is the Minister aware that on an earlier occasion, about 18 months ago, the European Union threatened to take action against Indonesia but has not done so?  Will he raise that matter within the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly take action on the latter matter mentioned by the Deputy.  I will also arrange to have discussions with the Australian Government about East Timor.  On the question of human rights abuses, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is the appropriate forum for consideration of such questions.  In relation to arms sales, our policy has always been to do everything possible to reduce the sale of armaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recall that when the Prime Minister of Australia was here recently there were pickets outside almost every function he attended to remind him, if he needed reminding, of the role Australia might play in getting through to the Indonesian Government?  I and my party leader submitted a letter to Mr. Keating outlining our outrage at Indonesian attacks in East Timor.  Has there been any discussion about the inconsistency between the way the world very quickly put sanctions on countries like Libya and Iraq and the way it is treating Indonesia in the context of East Timor?  The case of Indonesia and East Timor is no different from the case of Iraq when it took over Kuwait, except that it is on a smaller scale and the East Timorese have no oil or other product that we want and Indonesia has.  Will the Minister take up with his European Union partners the possibility of the European Union not giving favourable treatment to Indonesia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any discussions along the lines suggested by the Deputy, but the point is well made.  I <Col N="1289" /> will arrange for discussions to take place with the Australian Government about this matter to see if assistance is forthcoming and I will give it the priority which this House is demanding and which is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>How do we conduct our diplomatic relations with Indonesia?  I take it we have a diplomatic conduit of some kind with that country.  What has been done in recent years through that diplomatic conduit to protest to Indonesia about its invasion and occupation of East Timor?  I do not know if the Minister has seen a recent television programme by the eminent journalist, Mr. John Pilger.  It contains a particularly offensive scene which shows the Australian foreign minister and the Indonesian foreign minister in an aircraft flying over East Timor and toasting with champagne the handiwork that had gone on down below.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister will be taking up the issue with Australia because we have a direct diplomatic conduit with them.  Will the Minister question this particularly offensive scene in this film?  What was the foreign minister of Australia doing toasting the activities in East Timor with champagne?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>When I would have the time to watch it is another matter.  We have raised our concerns with the Indonesian Government.  I will have discussions with the Australian Government and I will have no difficulty in conveying the strong views of this House about the appalling situation that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Government has raised the matter with Indonesia and the undertaking the Minister has now given to raise it with the Australian Government.  It is equally important that he raise the matter within the European Union under the heading of common foreign policy and that we make it clear that we are unhappy that partners of ours in the European Union are supplying arms to the Indonesian Government.  Will the Minister also note that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs passed a motion urging a settlement of the conflict in East Timor based on the self determination of the people there and that it is not simply a question of the abuse of the bodily integrity of the people of East Timor but also an abuse of their political rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I did not refer to all aspects does not mean that we are not interested in the whole question of self determination of the people of East Timor.  The matter is placed on the European Union agenda regularly and I support the efforts made by my Portuguese colleague at UN level in that regard.  As suggested by the Deputy, I will raise at the UN the fact that we take offence at the supply of arms to that country by our European Union partners because, ultimately, that will not solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 18, 47 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The widespread presence of land mines throughout the countryside in Angola, <Col N="1292" /> Cambodia and Mozambique, to name but a few of the countries where land mines are maiming the civilian population, is an issue of grave concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the number of land mines planted during conflicts in countries around the world range up to 100 million, and their toll on civilians is intolerable: it is estimated that up to 150 people are killed or maimed every week by these devices.  Land mines, especially unmarked and undetectable ones, also pose considerable problems for peacekeeping forces.  Ireland is an original signatory of the Inhumane Weapons Convention, which was opened for signature in 1981, and the Government strongly supports its provisions.  The convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines, in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians.  Ireland has never manufactured or traded in any weapons which would be covered by the convention, and there is no intention to involve ourselves in such manufacture or trade.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on the question of land mines was made clear in the UN General Assembly in 1993, where we co-sponsored all three resolutions on the issues.  General Assembly Resolution 48/7, an initiative of the European Union, adopted unanimously by the Plenary of the General Assembly on 19 October 1993, highlighted the importance of UN co-ordination of activities related to mine clearing, and called on the Secretary General to submit a comprehensive report on the problems caused by mines and other unexploded devices.  Resolution 48/75K called on all states to introduce a moratorium on the export of land mines and Resolution 48/79 supported the convening of a review conference to strengthen the Inhumane Weapons Convention.</P>
    <P>The problem of countering the proliferation of land mines must also be viewed in the context of the wider question of restraint in the manufacture, possession, transfer and sale of all conventional weapons.  Ireland has been active in this area at the United Nations, <Col N="1293" /> notably through our support for the introduction of a United Nations Register of Armaments to include information on international transfers of certain categories of conventional weapons, and also in our promotion of a code of conduct for restraint in transfers of conventional weapons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply in so far as it goes.  Is he aware that the biggest manufacturer and exporter of such land mines, particularly the almost undetectable plastic types, is our EU partner, Italy?  What steps, if any, has the Minister taken to protest to the Italian Government about that despicable trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken an initiative in relation to co-sponsoring a motion at the United Nations General Assembly. We have also advocated the holding of a review conference and discussions in the framework of the common foreign and security policy.  The European Union supports the holding of a review conference on the implementation of the convention and we have added our signature to that of the signatory States who requested the convening of such a conference which is likely to take place in 1995.  We, as partners in the European Union, are participating in the expert working group and will continue to do so.  In regard to trade in such mines, we will have discussions with the Italian Government on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the number of land mines planted during conflicts around the world is estimated at approximately 100 million and that such land mines are widespread in countries such as Angolia, Cambodia and Mozambique, countries striving for democracy with no hope of overcoming the damage being done by such land mines unless they are removed?  Will the Minister take up with his EU partners and at UN level the possibility of enforcing the suppliers of such mines to be responsible for their removal and destruction?  Countries such as Italy, the United Kingdom <Col N="1294" /> and the United States, which have supplied such mines in the past, should be responsible for removing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that approximately 100 million land mines were planted during years of conflict in countries throughout the world and even that figure is a guess.  I mentioned Angola, Cambodia and Mozambique in particular. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, visited Cambodia and had discussions on that subject.  We are considering how we can make an appropriate contribution to mine clearance operations in Cambodia and the other countries to which I referred.  Obviously, it would be desirable if those countries which either exported or planted the land mines in the first place and who know where the mines played a role in ridding the world of such mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be made do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like those land mines removed so that we will not have to witness again the horror of the past number of months of people being maimed on a daily basis by such mines. Everything possible should be done in the international community in that regard and we will play our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the planting of land mines, I am sure the Minister is aware that the majority of them, particularly the small plastic ones, are dropped from the air.  Unlike in World War II films, soldiers no longer dig holes and place them in the ground.  Rather they are scattered by the thousands from the air and used primarily as anti-personnel mines, aimed specifically to kill and dismember the population in the area in which they are distributed.  They are also used as a means of neutralising land for growing crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister agree that we might assist by examining ways in which research could be carried out to detect the mines?  The main problem arises in detecting the location of the mines and it <Col N="1295" /> would be benefical if local people could detect mines in their area.  Perhaps we should place more emphasis on research on the detection of land mines.  As we do not have huge resources to disburse in that regard, we could assist by carrying out such research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reasons for using the mines.  They are certainly anti-personnel and used to cause the greatest possible amount of human destruction during an undefined period. They are also used to ensure that land cannot be recultivated.  The Deputy's suggestion is reasonable and if we can assist, financially or otherwise, in carrying out research in order to detect land mines and prevent further maiming or loss of life, we will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the Tánaiste's reply related to control in the manufacture and dissemination of mines.  An international effort is needed to clear the world of mines.  After the last war a great international effort was made to minesweep the seas because of the danger mines posed to shipping and so on.  What practical steps are being taken at EU and United Nations levels to minesweep &mdash; a term more appropriate to the sea than the land &mdash; stricken countries, such as Cambodia, Angola and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A co-ordinated mine clearance programme is inherent in the United Nations resolution.  We agree co-ordination is important if such a programme is to be carried out on an international scale.  The ultimate objective would be to have a mine clearing programme which would have to be financed, sponsored and regulated by the United Nations.  The Secretary General of the UN has been requested to make a comprehensive report to the General Assembly before its 49th session in relation to all aspects of the problem we are discussing, namely, the increasing presence of mine and other unexploded devices resulting from armed conflicts and on the manner in which the UN <Col N="1296" /> contribution to the solution of problems relating to mine clearance could be strengthened.  He has been requested to include in his report consideration of the financial aspects of mine clearance and of the advisability of establishing a voluntary trust fund to finance, in particular, information and training programmes relating to mine clearance and to facilitiate the launching of mine clearance operations.  He has also been requested to urge all member states to extend full assistance and co-operation to the Secretary General in this respect and provide him with any information which could be useful in drawing up the above-mentioned report.  The provisional agenda for the 49th session will include the item of assistance in mine clearance.  We will probably be better informed about this matter following the United Nations General Assembly in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 68 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of diplomatic relations with South Africa last October <Col N="1297" /> and the opening of an embassy in Pretoria began a new era in Irish-South African relations.</P>
    <P>I paid an official visit to South Africa from 8 to 11 January.  This visit gave me an opportunity to mark these new developments.  It also enabled me to hear at first-hand a broad range of views on the political and economic situation in South Africa in the run-up to the first non-racial elections which are to be held in April next.</P>
    <P>During my visit I had useful and informative meetings with State President Mr. F.W. de Klerk, Foreign Minister Mr. R.F. Botha, and with Mr. D.L Keys, Minister of Finance, of Trade and Industry as well as with a number of other Ministers.</P>
    <P>I also had very good discussions with Mr. Nelson Mandela, President of the African National Congress and with senior members of the ANC including Mr. Thabo Mbeki, the newly elected national chairman.  Mr. Mandela expressed his deep appreciation for Ireland's firm anti-apartheid stand over the years.  I was privileged to be the guest of honour at the celebrations in Soweto on 8 January marking the 82nd anniversary of the founding of the ANC.</P>
    <P>I also had useful discussions on political developments with representatives from other political parties including the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and the Afrikaner Volksfront.</P>
    <P>In addition, I received valuable briefings from the Chairman of the National Peace Secretariat and from the Director of Lawyers for Human Rights on the important human rights work being carried out by these two organisations.</P>
    <P>My visit also gave me an opportunity to meet members of the Irish community in Johannesburg and to pay tribute to the great work over many years of Mr. Paddy Ryan, our honorary consul.  In Soweto, I saw the important educational work being carried out by the Irish Sisters of Mercy amongst the black community.</P>
    <P>I believe there are good prospects for an increase in trade and commercial contacts <Col N="1298" /> between Ireland and South Africa. While in Johannesburg, I was pleased to launch the South Africa-Ireland Trade Association which has been established by a number of prominent Irish business people there with a view to encouraging trade between our two countries.  I also had discussions on economic and trade matters with the chief executive and senior members of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry and I had a valuable meeting with the managing director and senior managers of De Beers industrial diamond division.</P>
    <P>The April elections will mark a watershed in the history of South Africa.  A number of constitutional problems remain to be resolved between the Government, the ANC and the parties comprising the Freedom Alliance.  These problems are being urgently addressed and I welcome the recent four point offer on the constitution made by Mr. Mandela. I hope that a solution can be found to enable all groups to participate in the elections and I believe there is still time to resolve difficulties if all parties bring a constructive approach to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The serious problem of violence in the townships is a matter of the deepest concern. From my meetings and talks with people across the political spectrum I am however hopeful that notwithstanding present difficulties, a successful translation to a non-racial democratic South Africa will take place in April.</P>
    <P>On my visit I found great appreciation of the European Union's joint action to monitor the April elections.  Ireland has two officers serving in the EU's election unit whom I met and we will contribute 24 observers to the EU's observer mission. We will also be providing £20,000 for voter education programmes.</P>
    <P>In contacts during his visit to Ireland, and more recently through an envoy, Nelson Mandela has requested support for his party's efforts to reach as many as possible of the electorate to explain voting procedures to them and to ensure a large turnout.  In response he has been assured of our strong support for the electoral process and of our willingness <Col N="1299" /> to help, through additional funding, to make it as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed Irish Ambassador to South Africa is not yet accredited to other countries in the region on a nonresident basis.  Such accreditations would be a matter for discussion and agreement with the Government of the countries concerned and it would be inappropriate at this stage to speculate on any such possible developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 13 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's Strategy Plan for Irish Aid, which the Tánaiste and I launched in July 1993, devotes particular attention to the needs of Mozambique. It recognises that the years of civil war have left the country devastated in terms of physical and human capacity.  Over the coming period, the focus of the international aid effort in Mozambique will be on an intensive rehabilitation programme, especially in the infrastructure sector.  As the strategy plan makes clear, <Col N="1300" /> Ireland hopes to play its part in that process.</P>
    <P>In doing so, we are working closely with the Mozambican Government and in late January I met with the Mozambican Minister for Development, Mr. Jacinto Velose, to review progress to date.  An exploratory mission visited Mozambique last year to assess how best Irish aid might assist.  As a result, a budget of approximately £600,000 has been allocated for rehabilitation work in 1994.  Later this month, an official of my Department is travelling to Mozambique to identify specific projects for support this year.  In addition, funding will be provided to support election-related activities.  For example, Irish aid has agreed in principle to provide funding of £30,000 to AWEPA in this regard and a formal proposal is awaited from them. Moreover, it is possible that additional funding will be provided through cofinancing with Irish NGOs.</P>
    <P>Mozambique has been through a horrific period in its history.  We are encouraged however that the peace agreement signed in Rome some 16 months ago is holding well and we look forward to playing our part in the rebuilding process, both in the specific ways I have just outlined and through other means as are considered appropriate and feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 16 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach indicated to the House on 8 February, the Government viewed the decision to grant a visa to Mr. Adams as strictly a matter for the United States Government.</P>
      <P>This view, consistent with the Government's long standing position on matters of this kind, was conveyed in routine contacts with the US authorities in advance of the decision on 30 January to grant Mr. Adams a temporary visa.  The position which we took was one of neither support for, nor objection to, the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate this is a matter for the United States Government. However, am I to understand no contact was made between the United States and the Irish Government in respect of this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated the question <Col N="1302" /> was strictly a matter between the United States authorities and Mr. Adams.  Contact was made in advance by the consul general in Belfast concerning an interview with Mr. Adams.  The Government was asked if it had any objection to direct contact between Mr. Adams and the US authorities to ascertain whether Mr. Adams satisfied the necessary US legal criteria in respect of a visa waiver and we indicated there was no objection to such a course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's views on the circus that took place as a result of Gerry Adams' visit to the United States?  Does he believe it assisted in getting across to the American people the campaign of violence that is going on in Northern Ireland, supported by Sinn Féin candidates who must sign support for such a campaign when standing for election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the media circus that took place in New York during Mr. Adams' visit, nobody should be surprised by the way the American media hyped the visit.  That is part and parcel of the age of mass communications and media manipulation in the United States.  I would be inclined to take the view that if there is a renunciation of violence, if there is an announcement supporting the declaration of 15 December last, that visit will become a minor part of what has happened in the last number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to share the hope, expressed by President Clinton in his statement of 13 January, that the decision to enable Mr. Adams attend the New York conference would encourage him to bring about peace and bring an end to the tragic cycle of violence that has plagued the people of Northern Ireland for too long.  It is still our hope that that will take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the steady progress he has made in his Department in removing anomalies and streamlining payments and in his approach to alleviating hardship on the long term unemployed.  The employment provisions under the various headings are to be commended.  The Minister has struck a balance and ensured that the system is efficient and updated while at the same time he has dealt effectively with abuses in the system.  The rule of thumb used by most public representatives in assessing Departments is the number of representations they receive regarding qualification for schemes, payment systems and so on. Eight or ten years ago a large proportion of the work of TDs consisted of dealing with requests relating to social welfare and many of the problems were not resolved for some time.  Fewer queries are received and they are dealt with without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill places emphasis on the continuance of secondary social welfare benefits. In preparing the Bill the Minister concentrated on getting people back to work.  The Bill provides incentives for employers in labour intensive industries, such as the footwear and textile industries which encountered serious problems not alone in competing against Third World imports but in terms of VAT and the <Col N="1361" /> British devaluation in 1992-93.  Incentives are also being introduced for service industries which provide much needed jobs.  Any assistance for such industries is welcome.  The textile and footwear industries are major employers who work on tight margins.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in the employer's share of PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent for employees earning up to £173 per week.  The exemption from the health contribution and the employment and training levy for employees and the self-employed on low incomes is welcome, as is the removal of liability from employers of medical card holders to pay levies on behalf of their employees.  That was a bone of contention among employers in recent years.</P>
    <P>The new PRSI exemption scheme will greatly benefit employers in my area. Those who take on additional staff from the live register between 6 April 1994 and 5 April 1996 will not have to pay the employers' share of PRSI in respect of these employees.  This is a welcome improvement.  The last PRSI exemption scheme was very successful, generating 4,250 jobs over a two year period.  The benefit of the exemption to an employer will be considerable, amounting to £1,268 per year in respect of a new employee with earnings of £200 a week.  In addition, employers' PRSI has been reduced from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent in all sectors of employment where the employee earns up to £173 per week.  This measure will be of great assistance to labour intensive industries such as the clothing industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in the means test for the carer's allowance which will be of greater benefit to the hundreds of women in my constituency who provide full-time care and attention for elderly and incapacitated relatives. For the first time the first £100 of their husband's weekly earnings will be disregarded for the purposes of the means test.  The initial means of the carer which is also disregarded is being increased from £2 to £6 per week.  This means that a full time carer whose spouse earns £160 <Col N="1362" /> per week and who would not previously have been entitled to any payment will now receive a carer's allowance of £34 per week.  I hope the Minister will continue to concentrate on this area, the spiralling costs of maintaining elderly people in institutional care and the difficulty in obtaining places for them.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board, I am very aware of the difficultues in this area. A carer's allowance can mean the difference between a person remaining in his environment or being admitted to an institution.  In recent years the emphasis at health board level has been on community care and the development of services such as home help, district nurses and therapists.  The health boards are providing every assistance for the development of these services.  The day centres managed by voluntary staff which have been opened in many counties provide the elderly with meals and minor treatment.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for the funding he has provided in this area in recent years.  I am sure the level of funding allocated to my consituency was the same as that allocated to other constituencies.  While the funding was not very large &mdash; it may only have been £5,000, £10,000 or £15,000, which looks small in 1994 terms &mdash; it was a real bonanza for those people who required additional equipment, needed improvements carried out or required cooking facilities.  The Minister should continue to provide assistance for voluntary organisations and the many women who have more than enough work to do at home but who cook for them.  This service is of great benefit to elderly people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should discuss with the Minister for the Environment the possibility of providing additional funding for the housing and for the elderly scheme. This scheme has enabled many people who lived in houses which did not have a proper water supply, etc.  to remain in their environment.  In addition to the funding given by the Minister an additional allocation in this area would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the budget the <Col N="1363" /> Minister said that widows aged between 60 and 65 years will be eligible for all the free schemes, including the free travel pass, to which their late husbands were entitled.  I welcome this improvement as previously women had to endure large cutbacks in social welfare when their husbands died.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things which has amazed me during my five years in this House is the way which very important legislation often receives little attention outside the House when it is being debated.  I have always been amazed that the two most important Bills passed by this House every year &mdash; the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill &mdash; receive little or no public attention.  The Finance Bill affects every citizen in terms of taxation while the Social Welfare Bill, major legislation, governs how one third of the population of this State will live over the next year in terms of the incomes they will receive.  The incomes of the unemployed, widows, pensioners, orphans, etc. are decided in the Social Welfare Bill.  Yet if people going into or coming out of an employment exchange were asked what is happening in the Dáil today I doubt if many of those from whom one would get a printable reply would know that what is being discussed here today is the amount of money they will get for the next year.</P>
      <P>Why is this the case?  The public is hardly to blame.  How could people know what is being debated in the House today if someone does not tell them?  Perhaps Members of the House are to blame. Perhaps the matters of concern to the poor are not sexy enough to merit the kind of media attention which, for example, the residential property tax this year or the rod licence a few years ago, received.  It is interesting to note that only one of the morning papers, <i>The Irish Times</i>, had coverage of yesterday's debate on this Bill.  The only other coverage of the debate of which I am aware was a piece in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This contrasts starkly with the publicity given to consideration of the incomes of <Col N="1364" /> other sectors of society.  For example, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> a central element of which related to the pay of those in employment, was given a great launch and received a great deal of attention.  Anyone in employment will know what this programme is all about.  When farm prices are being debated in the European Union they receive widespread coverage.  Yet when the miserable subsistence payments given to the poorest people in our society are under consideration unfortunately they do not receive the same kind of attention. This gives rise to problems for those of us who in the course of our daily and weekly work meet people whose payments and incomes are decided in this House &mdash; we repeatedly come across who do not know the basis on which their incomes are decided.</P>
    <P>Next autumn people will draw our attention to some individual problem they have with social welfare such as a recent case reported in the social affairs column of <i>The Irish Times</i> which highlighted the case of a couple.  The woman tried to obtain a part-time job; she thought she could earn up to £45 per week but discovered that the rules had been changed last year and what had been a weekly allowance became a daily allowance.  That resulted in the couple losing £22.50 a week.</P>
    <P>Changes in the law, all of which are the subject of debate in this House, do not come to the attention of that huge segment of the population for whom this legislation is probably the most important this House will pass in the next 12 months.  It simply does not come to their attention until it is too late and they find themselves on the receiving end of these changes.  They go to their employment exchange, they are given information that greatly distresses them and then go to a social services advice centre or perhaps their TD to obtain clarification. Eventually some of them may end up in the appeals system, simply because the ground rules changed and people were not informed.  One of the disturbing features of this Social Welfare Bill is the taxation of unemployment benefit.  This <Col N="1365" /> will not come to the attention of many people until it actually takes place.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the social welfare system that I would like to address.  My colleague, Deputy De Rossa, addressed the essential elements of the Bill.  I strongly support the comments he made, particularly his criticism of the way in which the Government is giving the impression it is making great improvements for people on social welfare while the reality is quite different.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter that has not received much attention, the way in which cohabiting couples are treated differently by the social welfare and taxation systems.  People in cohabiting relationships are suffering serious discrimination because the social welfare system treats them as a married couple while the taxation system regards them as single people.  The time has come to eliminate that discrimination.</P>
    <P>I recently became aware of a case of a man who has been separated from his wife for many years.  He is in a low paid job in the public service and he pays maintenance for a child from his marriage. He established a stable relationship with another woman and they have one child and are expecting another. They purchased a house under the shared ownership scheme.  They have a stable permanent relationship but up to the time this man began living with his present partner, he benefited from a tax allowance as a single parent.  As soon as he began cohabiting he was no longer entitled to the single parent's tax allowance, the Revenue assessed him as a single person and he received single person's tax allowances.  His partner, however, experienced a somewhat different approach in the social welfare system. She naturally was not entitled to the lone parent's allowance once she began living with her partner.  She applied for unemployment assistance but did not qualify for that either because her means were assessed as her partner's income.  In other words, the social welfare system treats this couple as a married couple but the taxation system only allows them the single person's allowance.  The mortgage <Col N="1366" /> relief they receive for the house is calculated on the basis of a single person.</P>
    <P>This represents a two-handed approach by two arms of the State.  When paying this couple the State assesses them as a married couple, but when it takes money from them in the form of taxation, they are regarded as single people.  This problem will have to be addressed because there are many other such cases. I know of a couple in similar circumstances where the man participated in a FÁS social employment scheme.  This couple were living together and he claimed his partner as a dependent under the social welfare system.  Once he took up the FÁS scheme he discovered that FÁS had its own rules regarding what constituted a married person and he ended up actually losing money.  This problem must be addressed because we cannot continue to have the social welfare and taxation systems treating people in different ways.  The Minister for Social Welfare should in some way co-ordinate with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, either through the mechanism of the Social Welfare Bill or the Finance Bill or both.  Cohabiting couples must be treated the same by both systems.  The State cannot have it both ways; it cannot treat the same people differently for different purpose.  This matter is urgent because many people are now caught in this situation.</P>
    <P>I agree also with some of the comments made earlier by Deputy Bell on the way means are calculated for the purposes of unemployment assistance for people in various forms of casual employment.  I came across a case this week of a person who has been unemployed for three years.  At some stage during 1993 the type of irregular work he was doing was defined by the Department of Social Welfare as constituting self-employment He is now getting a few hours work per week but is losing substantially in his payments from the Department of Social Welfare because of the way in which his means are assessed.</P>
    <P>This area will have to be addressed urgently because the simple way in which employment was defined in the past and <Col N="1367" /> the days of the regular 39 to 40 hour week job no longer exists.  If the Government is serious about encouraging people to take up employment opportunities, we must have a social welfare system which will enable people who obtain one or two days' work on an irregular basis to take up such employment without losing benefits or being designated as self-employed. A third area I want to address, one which probably requires some co-ordinated approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The third issue I want to take up is the construction industry.  This issue requires the attention of the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance and perhaps the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in so far as it relates to employment conditions as there are now circumstances prevailing within the building industry in which people who were formerly employed under the normal P45 basis are rapidly becoming a thing of the past.  Increasingly in the construction industry people who want to work on a building site are being forced to work on what is known as the C45 and lose very substantially on their various social welfare entitlements, security of employment, in relation to pension and sick pay cover; entitlements to holiday <Col N="1368" /> pay and, very often, on the employment conditions normally applicable to a building site.  My understanding is that the C45 system was intended to deal with the problems of the black economy within the construction industry but, unfortunately, what was intended to address abuses within the industry has become a regular feature.  This means that a building worker turning up at a building site looking for a job will be told that the only way he will get one is by being defined in some way as a subcontractor of one kind or another, taking employment under the C45 system.  The people working in the construction industry are becoming more agitated about this problem.  I am aware that the trade unions representing building workers and various committees of building workers are actively seeking changes in this system which is being abused.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk over the years about the treatment of women; we have heard much about the Government being pro-women.  The test of its sincerity is whether it is prepared to pay women money awarded to them under the various equality arrangements within the EC.  It is scandalous that the Government is effectively forcing women individually to go through tortuous and-expensive legal processes to extract payments to which they were entitled in the first place from the Department of Social Welfare.  Before expecting any more women to have to resort to court to establish their entitlements under EC law, the Minister should make an announcement and award those women their due payments. If he does not all the rhetoric emanating from the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> its commitment to women and women's rights will be perceived as nothing more than a sham.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare who, since 1987, during the period when he was in charge of the Social Welfare portfolio &mdash; even when the public finances were extremely tight &mdash; showed his concern and care for the less well off in society. In the case of each budget to which his <Col N="1369" /> Department made an input we could be happy in the knowledge that he listened attentively, discussed problems with the less well off, learned from them, took their advice and implemented increases in each of those budgets, particularly between 1987 and 1989.  He took additional innovative steps last year, one in relation to the family income supplement, resulting in a dramatic 25 per cent take-up of the FIS scheme this year over and above last year.  This means 9,600 families are now in receipt of the family income supplement in addition to 30,000 children benefiting.</P>
      <P>It is clear the Minister realised there was a problem in some areas of employment, that it was possible for someone to be working for less than they would receive on the dole and that improvements were necessary.  This has meant that, again this year, there have been further adjustments in the weekly income thresholds, taking account of the tax measures announced in the budget, giving a £10 increase at each threshold point, resulting in the awarding of an additional £6 per week in weekly payments. That is a most welcome development.</P>
      <P>Another matter on which I should like to compliment the Minister &mdash; one on which I have particularly strong feelings &mdash; is the proposed adjustment in the carer's allowance, particularly bearing in mind that so many people look after elderly relatives in their own homes.  The Minister proposes to disregard earnings of £100 per week, in other words, a person can earn up to £100 per week which will be disregarded as income for means test purposes.  This will mean an additional 500 carers will be catered for under the provisions of this scheme in addition to the 350 already in receipt of this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the practice in which the Minister engages, that of going out among people working in the welfare area, perhaps he will examine the overall position relating to care before next year's budget because many people in nursing homes might not necessarily have to be accommodated there if the carer's <Col N="1370" /> allowance was made available on a better basis.</P>
    <P>People with relatives in nursing homes paid on average between £150 and £170 per week.  The welcome subvention which was made available was taken up by private nursing homes who dramatically raised their charges by between £30 and £50 per week.  I am sure there is a substantial number of people who could be looked after at home.  The elderly would be far happier being lovingly cared for by their families.  I am not saying anything against nursing homes or the level of care they provide but, where the infirmity allows, some people could be cared for at home.</P>
    <P>The return to work scheme is innovative. There may be difficulty regarding the enterprise allowance scheme and the employee incentive scheme which are operated by FÁS.  Eligibility under those schemes is limited to the amount of time spent on the live register.  Both these schemes are under review and for a two-month period the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment will evaluate the effectiveness of the schemes and see if they overlap.  Were the schemes to cease those aged between 18 and 22 years would be in no man's land as far as obtaining allowances or aid to start up in business is concerned.  In order to qualify for the enterprise allowance scheme one must be signing on for 13 weeks.  The allowance payable is £40 for a single person and £65 for a married person.  People with a dependent spouse and children in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit would receive about £120 or £140 per week.  Many of them opted for the enterprise allowance scheme at a rate of £65 a week.  They were willing to take a reduction and put their entrepreneurial skills to work.</P>
    <P>In Cork an average of 25 people per month take up this allowance.  That would realise 300 jobs over a 12-month period, which is not to be scoffed at. If this scheme were suspended it might affect those who were made redundant. Many unemployed people have expertise, experience, skill and knowledge and would be likely to start up their own <Col N="1371" /> business.  Their initiative, drive and energy could be lost if the enterprise allowance scheme is not continued.</P>
    <P>The return to work scheme pertains particularly to those over 25 years of age and unless we rectify the position somebody aged 18 who has a good idea will not receive aid.  I know the Minister will not allow that to happen.  The budget for the enterprise allowance scheme is under £5 million of which less than £1 million has been allocated for the Cork-Kerry region.  Perhaps it would be worth reviewing the anomaly that exists.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his entrepreneurial spirit in dealing with the social welfare portfolio.  No doubt he will listen attentively and learn from people.  He always had the happy knack of finding money where other Departments could not and I would recommend him to continue on that road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some improvements we would like to see made to this Bill.  If we keep on reminding the Minister perhaps we will see a big improvement in the implementation of social welfare regulations.  Applicants for social welfare benefit go through unnecessary harassment when they are being assessed.  I fail to understand why a system cannot be devised where each person would be assessed as to their income and the information held on file. If they applied for other State benefits &mdash; pensions, medical cards, etc. &mdash; the one assessment could suffice.  If a person applies for unemployment benefit they must be assessed by social welfare officers and the same applies if they apply six months later for, say, a medical card or under other schemes.  Frequently this entails a number of visits to the applicant in trying to establish his or her income. This is particularly the case with farmers or people deriving a small income from agriculture or land use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I met somebody who had applied for unemployment assistance, having worked for a number of months, but he did not qualify because of the regulation regarding the number of <Col N="1372" /> stamps required.  This man wants to work and will work at every opportunity.  Even if he goes on unemployment assistance he will take the first job he gets and is constantly seeking work.  When that work does not pay him much more then he would get on unemployment assistance he will take whatever he can find.  Three weeks ago he was laid off from temporary work on the buildings, applied for unemployment assistance and was again assessed. He has 20 ewes and four cows on a small piece of land which he inherited a few years ago.  Following assessment, the social welfare officer arrived at the conclusion that because he has an income of £42.85 from farming and his wife is working part-time he does not qualify for unemployment assistance.  How can a social welfare officer estimate that a farmer or land owner with 20 ewes and four cows has an income of £42.85 per week?  It baffles me.  If that was the income from this type of farming this country would be a great place in which to live.</P>
    <P>When a file has been opened on a person who has been assessed I cannot understand that it does not remain there as the guideline to the person's circumstances. I agree that perhaps every couple of years that information should be updated so that the Department of Social Welfare would be aware of the person's circumstances.  If after six months that man applies to the Western Health Board for a medical card the same assessment process will have to take place regarding his eligibility.  If the assessment is correct in the first instance I cannot understand the reason it is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on aspects of his budget speech and on some of the regulations.  Encouraged by the success of previously bringing those matters to the attention of the Minister I continue to raise the matter of young unemployed people in households.  I have four teenage children.  When a young person in a household applies for unemployment assistance, because of the benefit of living at home, they are refused.  This matter bears repeating because it is very important for the whole structure of the family. <Col N="1373" /> If a person aged 18 to 20 years living at home, one of whose parents is working in a reasonable job, applies for social welfare assistance he or she is refused on the grounds of benefit derived from board and lodging.  If they move out, as happens frequently in Galway city, to a flat or rented acommodation and apply for unemployment assistance they will receive the full rate.  If the following week, they go the health board and say that they are in receipt of unemployment assistance and living in flat costing in the region of £50, £60 or £70 per week they will get a rent subsidy allowance.  What the health boards or the Department of Health spend is apparently no skin off the nose of the Department of Social Welfare.  The attitude of Government Department is that each Department must balance its own budget.</P>
    <P>Young people living at home who were refused unemployment assistance are now costing the State more than if they had got three quarters or half the unemployment assistance rate.  Most of them would be happy with some deduction in the rate of unemployment assistance and to continue living in the family home. Not alone is this counter-productive and costing the State more in the long term, it is also causing the break-up of families. When young people, who want to be independent, cannot obtain unemployment assistance while living at home they will move out of the family home. When they do, particularly in urban areas, they are competing with young married couples who are legitimately seeking rented accommodation, they are driving up the price of rented accommodation and putting more people on the housing waiting list.  This problem will be solved by the Department of the Environment.  As long as the Departments of Health and Social Welfare balance their budgets the Department of the Environment can balance its budget and supply houses or flats to those now being driven on to the housing waiting list due to the demand for private rented accommodation. I do not apologise for raising this matter and bringing it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> If young people live at home they will be helped and encouraged by their parents to seek gainful employment.  As a parent I would certainly help and I am sure other parents would do likewise. The pressure to help would not be so great if those people were not living at home.  We are creating a further breakdown in society in encouraging unstable relationships which is a serious matter.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to treat young people living at home who apply for unemployment assistance or for social welfare as they would if they were living in private rented accommodation. It will benefit everybody in the long run.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has made a breakthrough with regard to qualification for the carer's allowance.  I have raised this with him on every occasion since it was introduced in the budget three or four years ago.  From July the carer's allowance will be over £60. The allowance at last gave recognition to the work of caring for old and infirm people in their homes rather than in institutions. When it was introduced I suggested that it would be wonderful if people could qualify easily but unfortunately out of the estimated 60,000 to 100,000 carers only 5,000 qualified for the allowance.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that some of the anomalies have been addressed in this Bill. The wife of a small farmer who cared for two bedridden old people, one doubly incontinent, was refused the carer's allowance because her husband's income was assessed at over £119 per week which when halved gave her an income of about £59 per week, which put her 9p over the limit.  The Minister rectified this anomaly in the budget; where one spouse is the carer, the first £100 of joint income will be disregarded.  This is significant and something we have been pressing for. The first £100 of that income of £119 will be disregarded, giving a joint income of £19.  Of the wife's income of £9.50, the first £6 will be disregarded from 28 July. That carer will now have an estimated income of £3, which qualifies her for the carer's allowance less £3.</P>
    <P>The case of single carers has not been <Col N="1375" /> catered for and we will highlight it throughout the year.  Many single people have left jobs to care for parents and sometimes they have missed marriage opportunities in order to devote their lives to caring for their parents.  Where there is an income these people have not been catered for which regard to qualifying for the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>If I spent all my time talking about the carer's allowance I would be happy with my contribution to the budget debate and to the debate on this Bill in the knowledge that I am getting somewhere. A campaign has been conducted by carers to highlight their grievances.  One will not see carers protesting outside the gates of Leinster House or at public meetings or at the constituency clinics simply because caring is a full-time job and they devote all their time to the job.  They are dedicated people and I would welcome further concessions by the Minister to bring the other 60,000 or 70,000 carers into eligibility for the allowance.  In some cases carers just want recognition.  It is a psychological blow to a person applying for the carer's allowance to be told that he cannot qualify.  It makes a person feel that his contribution is being totally ignored by the State and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to keep up the good work in easing the qualification requirements for the carer's allowance.  I am sure he will understand if I press him on this issue during the year.  When he takes a positive step to improve the lot of carers I will acknowledge it as I have done today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with the remarks of previous speakers complimenting the Minister on his continued ability to ensure that those who are in need of social welfare payments are continually defended.  Anyone recognising the financial difficulties and the problems with which we have had to grapple can only look back at the tenure of office of Deputy Woods as being one where those in need have always had their rights defended by the Minister.  The Bill continues along that road and it is undoubtedly <Col N="1376" /> one of the reasons the Minister has proved to be the most popular holder of that portfolio in modern times.  He has ensured that social welfare increases have kept pace with or exceeded inflation.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his continued support of voluntary organisations. It is his policy, prior to the preparation of the Estimates, to consult with voluntary organisations to hear their views and to take account of the points made, and then in so far as is possible to incorporate their requirements in the proposals he brings to Cabinet each year. The Minister's approach is highly regarded by voluntary organisations.  The grant available through the Department which the Minister has defended year in and year out and has increased, where possible, has proved to be of tremendous benefit to local voluntary organisations carrying out work in communities where needs are greatest.  I am pleased that this year the Minister has taken account of representations he has received from men's organisations.  The Minister has responded by providing financial assistance for self-development courses for men.  This is welcome and I am sure we will see its benefits in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made provision in the Estimate for a direct contribution to job creation by reducing employers' PRSI contributions from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent for employees earning £173 per week or less.  Employers have called for measures to cut their costs and the Minister has responded.  The cost structure in labour intensive industries has made it difficult for them to compete with Third World imports.  The Government has taken decisions which will greatly reduce the cost of production in those industries.  Employers, workers and trade unions in labour intensive industries have a duty to create additional jobs.  Costs have been cut through the Minister's action and it is now up to industry to keep faith with us by expanding their businesses.  The reduction in costs should be of tremendous benefit and I hope we will see increased employment in this sector.  These industries have <Col N="1377" /> experienced problems with costs and cheap imports.</P>
    <P>The clothing and footwear industries were substantial employers but they have suffered badly as a result of imports.  It should now be possible for these industries to become more competitive and to seek to displace imports as well as developing export markets.  That would make a significant contribution to genuine job creation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the large multiples to buy locally produced goods instead of travelling to far flung fields.  It is not always possible to maintain continuity of supply and quality control when buying in from abroad.  There may be short term gains but it may not be in their long term interests.  It is far better that multiples contribute to the development of indigenous industries by buying home produced products and entering into discussions with producers so that Irish industry can provide what is required. There is room for a partnership between industry and the multiples.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his continued support for the family supplement, which is available to certain categories of workers.  In the past the Minister expressed disappointment that all those entitled to avail of the scheme did not take it up and he arranged for a campaign to bring it to the attention of those who might be entitled to such a supplement.  The figures show that 9,600 families are receiving family income supplement which is benefiting over 30,000 children.  This is a very important supplement and I support the Minister's efforts to ensure that all those who qualify for it are in a position to take it up.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently agreed to meet with the British-Irish parliamentary group, of which I am a member, to discuss various social security matters that affect Irish citizens in the United Kingdom.  I think I speak for everybody on the committee when I express appreciation to the Minister for having taken the trouble to meet with us at short notice and tease out the topics of interest to us. The Minister is concerned about aspects of proposed legislation in the United <Col N="1378" /> Kingdom which might affect Irish citizens who reside in the UK or here.  He has given a commitment to take up with his counterpart in the UK various aspects of the proposed legislation in an effort to ensure that no Irish citizen is unduly affected and the same applies to UK citizens living here.</P>
    <P>I urge him to continue with the programme of modernisation in his Department. The Department has undergone an extraordinary change in terms of computerisation, user friendliness and its ability to respond efficiently to queries raised by individuals.  Everything has changed dramatically in the Department. I hope the Minister will continue to improve the systems to make them more easily understandable to those who need help of one kind or another.  Very often, a person's first contact with the Department of Social Welfare arises in traumatic circumstances, for example, a person may have lost his or her job, have become a widow or a widower or have some disability. It is important that the individual gets a sympathetic hearing.  They need to be assured of receiving accurate information quickly.  For years the Department's capital programme tended to be the Cinderella but the Minister must be complimented on the development of user friendly offices throughout the country. Obviously the capital works cost a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>The offices are to the credit of those who designed them, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Social Welfare.  I compliment the Minister for proceeding with the new social welfare office in Tallaght which is currently under construction.  This is an important development and complements other major projects which have either been completed or are under way in that area. When that office is opened the people of Tallaght will have a facility to be proud of.  It should be able to provide an outstanding service for those who have a reason to deal with the Department.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the role played by community welfare officers in serving the community.  There is a difficulty in terms of what exactly these <Col N="1379" /> officers can do.  We often receive complaints from individuals at our clinics that community welfare officers tend to vary their approach in dealing with applicants for assistance.  The Minister will have to address this matter in consultation with the Department of Health to ensure that an even-handed approach is adopted and people do not have cause for concern.  In addition, there is a need for improved facilities to ensure that people can be assisted quickly.  There are grounds for complaint in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a need for flexibility in the payment of social welfare benefits.  There are cases where a person entitled to a pension for one reason or another did not apply at the appropriate time.  I understand that when this happens the payment is only backdated three months. I ask the Minister to consider taking the right to make a decision in individual cases rather than allowing an officer in his Department to decide that because the application was not made on time the payment can only be backdated three months.  There is a need for flexibility. After all, one may take it when a person reaches retirement age they will act in an honest manner.  They should not be penalised for not making an application on time.</P>
    <P>As someone who has taken a keen interest in the settlement of the travelling community, I ask the Minister to review the requirment that travellers living in the Dublin region sign on in Castle Street.  This matter is a source of concern and it was highlighted by travellers on a television programme last night.  It is not right that travellers should be singled out and told that they have to sign on in a particular centre in Dublin.  Irrespective of whether there are administrative difficulties with identification, travellers should be treated in the same way as every other citizen who has to sign on. The Minister should investigate this matter immediately and ensure that this practice &mdash; which borders on discrimination &mdash; is brought to an end forth-with. If it is convenient for members of the travelling community to sign on in Castle <Col N="1380" /> Street, that is fair enough, but they should be entitled to sign on at any centre.</P>
    <P>In increasing social welfare payments in line with or above the rate of inflation and tackling the problem of moneylending the Minister has made a considerable contribution to the development of a caring Department of Social Welfare.  He began the attack on the problem of illegal moneylending in 1989 and has increased the number of pilot projects each year since then.  I understand that in Cork and other areas this horrific practice is on the decline. This is a tremendous achievement, particularly for those who had to hand over their social welfare books to illegal moneylenders, an ugly practice which is not in accordance with the law.</P>

      <P>People who play sport tend to be magnanimous.  The Minister has impressed many people.  The Department of Social Welfare is now more accessible and user friendly and the Minister is to be complimented on this. However, there are some things about the Department of Social Welfare that I find objectionable, particularly the manner in which some of the officers of <Col N="1381" /> the Department pursue people.  I do not blame the officers themselves; they are being instructed to pursue and harass people in receipt of benefits.  A review of the means of about 3,600 old age pensioners is being carried out in a pilot scheme, beginning with 600 bachelors over 75 years of age on the western seaboard who mostly live in isolated places, who are vulnerable and who are just living out their last days and expect to be left in peace.  If the Minister wants to make savings there are other areas where he could do so rather than targeting this section of the community.  I am disappointed about that.  The methods used are reminiscent of imperial times.  The Minister should do away with this new form of surveillance the officials of his Department are being told to employ.  It is no credit to the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>I would have expected more, in this Year of the Family, than an increase in child benefit from £20 to £25 for the third child and an increase of just £2 for each subsequent child.  The fact that we have the third lowest rate of child benefit in Europe puts this increase into perspective. This will not benefit the large number of families who depend on child benefit, sometimes to put bread on the table.  In many cases child benefit is the housewife's only source of income, particularly if she does not work outside the home.  This increase will just about keep pace with inflation and will not make the lot of Irish families any easier. In the light of the commitment given in the Programme for Government that there would be substantial increases in child benefit, I am disappointed.  Like many other things, this commitment was also forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in PRSI payable by employers in respect of employees earning up to £173 a week is welcome, but it will not have the impact it was designed to have.  I have received correspondence already from one factory in Killarney, Pretty Polly, which is finding it difficult to survive because of the decline in the hosiery trade throughout Europe and the cost factor of employing people in Killarney compared with their plant in England <Col N="1382" /> where the social cost of employing a worker is £20 less.  The exemption in this Bill will not have much impact.  Perhaps the Minister could review it and increase it by at least £200 next year. That may make an impact.  The benefit to the tourism industry will be neutralised by taxation on unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the budget relating to the carer's allowance which will bring an extra 500 people into the scheme and bring the numbers nationwide to about 5,000.  However, only a very small percentage of carers receive a carer's allowance.  I accept that this is an attempt to bring more carers into the system.  Nevertheless many carers are saving the State money by looking after people in their homes and keeping them out of old people's homes and geriatric units in hospitals.  The carer's allowance raised people's hopes when it was first introduced but it has been a major let down because, although people expected to qualify rather easily, that did not happen.</P>
    <P>The home help scheme is an integral part of the community care service.  The money that is paid to these people, who are the unsung heroes of the community, is derisory.  In one health board area it is £1 an hour.  In the Southern Health Board area it is £1.40 an hour, and in the Eastern Health Board area it is about £3 an hour, which is not too bad.  It is an insult to these people to offer them that amount of money.  Often the home help is the only contact old people have with the outside world.  The home help brings their food, their papers and their letters, and it is an insult to them that health boards will only offer them £1.40.  The scheme will collapse if people are not treated properly.  I hear no talk of these people.  In all the national agreements they are ignored as if they did not matter, but they are most important people doing vital work in the community.  They are the backbone of the community health programme and they are being ignored.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for reversing his decision to means test widows' contributory pensions.  It was a wise political move because that proposal incurred the <Col N="1383" /> wrath of many widows.  Nine of the infamous dirty dozen cuts, on which the Labour Party won many seats in the last election are still in place.  Very little progress has been made on reversing the dirty dozen cuts.  The Labour Party is now in power and has fooled the people on that issue as well as on many others. When the dirty dozen cuts were introduced, members of the Labour Party singled out the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevey, for special attention in his constituency but that is all forgotten about.  Deputy Stagg, who instigated the campaign against Deputy McCreevy, is sitting pretty alongside him as a Minister of State and has conveniently forgotten about the dirty dozen.</P>
    <P>The proposed tax on unemployment benefit will be a hot potato and a land mine for this Government when its consequences sink home.  Last Saturday night I met 20 women in Waterville who work part-time in the tourism industry, all of whom will be affected by this provision. They represent thousands of other women througout the country who are working on a seasonal basis in the tourism industry and, in many cases, whose husbands are earning lower incomes.  Their benefits will now be taxed.  This provision will have an adverse effect on up to 75,000 people who will incur an average loss in income of £400 per annum.  The Government estimates that in a full year this measure will yield approximately £30 million.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office show that about 75,000 people were receiving unemployment benefit in 1992 and 1993.  This measure will result in a decrease of approximately £8 per week and will have major implications for those affected.  Those people will not bother to work or will force employers to employ them in the black market.  It will create a major problem for employers who are anxious to keep their affairs above board and for employees who will not be rewarded for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be inundated with representations on this matter, especially from those in the tourism industry.  For <Col N="1384" /> example, Kerry Co-operative let go approximately 350 people from their Listowel factory during the winter and those people will be badly affected by this measure.  It will also dismantle the benefits to PRSI workers, part of the systematic dismantling of our social insurance system.  The taxation of unemployment benefit will cripple those on short-time work, in seasonal work and those working for half a week and receiving unemployment benefit for the remainder of the week.  Employees in a factory in Listowel have been on short-time work for the past year and that factory would be closed if those employees were not able to draw unemployment benefit while out of work.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the provision under which those paying social insurance in the United Kingdom have to make one contribution here on taking up residence to qualify for unemployment benefit?  That is an unfair provision and one to which Deputy Allen referred at length in his contribution.  As members of the European Union we should all operate under the same social framework and this provision should not apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the general good wishes which Members expressed to the Minister.  There has been a change in the attitude of personnel in his Department since he took up office.  Nevertheless, the scrutiny to which people are subject when they apply for social welfare benefits is rather annoying; it is as if they are not trusted.  That attitude should change.  It is not their fault that they are dependent on the social welfare system. <Col N="1385" /> Of the 300,000 unemployed, 90 per cent would prefer to work and if they cannot find work it is not their fault.  The proposed tax on unemployment benefit is outrageous.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has addressed some of the problems, will he ask his officials how they come up with the astronomical incomes for small farmers?  He should give a pilot farm with ten cows and some calves to one of those officials to see how much money he or she will earn in a year.  If he or she receives an income similar to that which they have been coming up with for small farmers I will be the first to applaud them.  Small farmers are on the poverty line and the incomes the officials have come up with are incorrect.  There are many hidden costs in farming and I am sure the Minister knows that those figures are unwarranted. Small farmers are always just £2 or £3 above the income limit for any benefits the Minister introduces.  Will the Minister consider the manner in which those farmers' incomes are assessed?</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is very welcome. Caring is a vocation and means that those involved are on call 24-hours each day. Carers and home helps should be generously compensated for their work.  Many old and infirm people are extremely lonely, their only contact being with the person caring for them or the home help who comes to visit them.  Carers and home helps are saving the State a great deal of money.  If they were not carrying out such work those being cared for would have to be placed in institutions, which provide excellent facilities but are extremely costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of taking care of our itinerants has been bandied about for a long time.  Everybody is concerned but nobody is doing anything.  I am one of the few Deputies who can say that the county council of which I am a member has established a halting site for itinerants in our county town.  That has been a successful development but the site is overcrowded because neighbouring counties have not provided similar facilities. The Minister should insist on each local authority providing a halting site <Col N="1386" /> within its own area so that everybody can take care of their people and not have them making a nuisance of themselves by moving around the country.  Many barricades have been erected to prevent those unfortunate people locating in an area for a short time.  There should be a proper halting site.  I draw those two points to the attention of the Minister and his officials.  If he addresses them I will be the first to congratulate him in 12 months' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Deenihan put untruths on the record and I want to set the record straight.  He said that the Labour Party had forgotten about its commitment to increases in child benefit. If he compares this Social Welfare Bill with that of last year he will see there has been a move towards looking after large families in receipt of low incomes.  The Opposition calls for increased expenditure and then criticises it when it is made.  The Bill addresses people in receipt of low pay, those depending on social welfare benefits, particularly large families, by providing increases in child benefit.  We are proud of our work in this area and <Col N="1387" /> we have an ongoing commitment to cater for low income families by ensuring their income is higher than the cost of living increase they would normally expect to receive.  Under the Bill the number of people who will receive the projected rise in the cost of living will increase by approximately one million people.  That measure extends increased income in the form of family income supplement, increased invalidity pension and so on to many people.</P>
      <P>Many people may not understand the changes in respect of invalidity pension. Under the social welfare code there are different contributions for invalidity and old age pensions.  I know of people who opted to switch from invalidity pension to old age pension but were told they did not have sufficient contributions to qualify.  The Bill proposes that invalidity pensioners who do not have the required maximum contributions automatically get the old age pension at the age of 66.  That type of change is necessary for people who worked as long as possible and had made the relevant contributions but still did not have the maximum to qualify for a contributory old age pension. I am pleased about that measure because I received hundreds of representations in that regard during the years.  The Minister is aware that I criticised him, advised him and worked with him as spokesperson on social welfare for my party.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Boylan.  Unfortunately, there is a perception in rural areas that people with three or four cows and a few sheep should not be entitled to assistance from the State and that they would be happier coping with their small farm.  However, that involves means testing, one of the most odious forms of testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in the Department believe they have an obligation to intensively investigate people who do not have sufficient contributions to qualify for benefit. The greatest number of complaints Deputies receive are about means testing. Recently, I had a complaint from a person who told me he was asked awful questions in front of another person <Col N="1388" /> about when he was last employed, if he had an opportunity to avail of work and other questions.  It is essential when such investigations &mdash; which are separate from means testing which takes place in one's home &mdash; take place in a public area or in an office in which there is a lack of privacy that we should be sensitive about people's feelings.  We should ensure that our officials adopt a user friendly policy on this matter as they act on our behalf.  It is essential that they understand people's sensitivities.  I do not condone people who are not entitled to social welfare benefit drawing it or attempting to draw it, but a balance must be struck.  Many people find it difficult to make ends meet and if they do not receive assistance from the State who else can they turn to except moneylenders and others who make excessive demands on them?  The Bill addresses real areas of need and the Minister and the Government must be complimented on it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the concept of the abolition of pay related benefit.  The abolition of the pay related element of the contribution is compensated by index linking benefit and this will be of benefit in cases where families suffer trauma through illness or loss of employment. The Minister has balanced the decision by increasing the rates to a level higher than the amount of pay related contributions that would be added to the normal social welfare benefits.  There have been criticisms of the decision to tax unemployment benefit on the basis that is a benefit.  All parties and the trade union movement have indicated that income from all sources should be considered for tax purposes, which may appear severe.  I understand income will not be taxed at source.  The facilities within the Department to join the tax and social welfare codes have not yet been perfected.  Benefit will not be taxed at the source of payment.  There will be an opportunity at the end of the year for a working spouse or a working spouse and an unemployed or sick spouse to put their incomes and their allowances together and receive whatever refunds are due.  Social welfare incomes will be <Col N="1389" /> paid on the basis that they are tax free as is the case in regard to the income of a contributory old age or widowed pensioner. All contributory pensioners when finalising their tax affairs at the end of the tax year have an opportunity to disclose to Revenue officials other sources of income.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to treat wid-owers in the same way as widows.  It is welcome that payment will not be subject to a cap of £12,000 or £16,000.  The benefit arises from the concept of contributions and representations have been made in this regard from Government and Opposition parties and people dealing with the underprivileged.  In the past the lone parent's allowance was subject to a cap.  Lone parents are more anxious than most to get back into the workplace and I am glad that their allowance is now subjected to a less stringent means test. At present there is no incentive for lone parents to get back into the workforce but under the Bill the Minister is assisting them and ensuring they get back to work.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that when improvements are made in the social welfare code, within months of an increase being made local authorities claw back the money under the different rent scheme and in some cases people end up worse off.  We should work closely with local authorities to ensure that people who receive increases are not penalised.</P>
    <P>Under the present system when the main breadwinner who was entitled to free electricity, free telephone rental and so on, dies, the spouse automatically loses those benefits if she has not reached the age of 66.  Under the Bill the Minister is extending these benefits to widows who reach the age of 60.  I know of women widowed at Christmas who will be excluded from these benefits because it is stipulated that only people widowed since budget day will benefit from the new measure.  In these circumstances there will be two different categories of widows, some will receive benefits such as free telephone, free fuel, free electricity and so on while others whose husbands died before budget day will be treated differently.  When improvements <Col N="1390" /> are made in schemes there is the possibility that anomalies will be created in other areas.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>On the carer's allowance, I know of people who had been caring for their neighbours but because the person being cared for lost their benefits the carer opted not to care for them.  If a woman's husband went to work for FÁS that woman was no longer eligible for the allowance.  The Minister has addressed some of the anomalies in this area by abolishing means testing for carers whose spouses are working or employed by FÁS.</P>
    <P>There are many good provisions in the Bill, but it is important that the Minister address the anomalies in the social welfare code.  The Labour Party will continue to ensure that these anomalies are ironed out so that we have a user friendly service aimed at those most in need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Woods, on his caring and compassionate attitude to the social welfare service.  He has outstanding knowledge of the social welfare system and he should keep up the good work.</P>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil came to office we have sought to protect and improve the position of those dependent on social welfare.  I compliment the Minister on the progress made despite the financial constraints.  It is estimated that expenditure on social welfare in 1994 will be in excess of £3.8 billion.  This is possible by virtue of good management of our economy and control of our public finances. I wholeheartedly support the Fianna Fáil philosophy that the poor, disadvantaged and old have a special claim on the resources of the community and that they must be protected.  We are committed to social progress, as demonstrated in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill all social welfare payments are being increased by at least 3 per cent.  People on disability and unemployment benefit will receive an increase of 10 per cent while short-time unemployed and supplementary welfare recipients will receive an increase of 6 per cent. <Col N="1391" /> There is an increase of £10.20 per week in the personal rate of invalidity pensioners aged over 66 years.  A sum of £27.5 million is provided for the survivor's pension which will benefit more than 9,000 widowed men and their families, a major improvement in social welfare legislation. The weekly income thresholds for family income supplement are being increased and there are improvements in the lone parent's allowance.  A new earning disregard is being introduced for people in receipt of carer's allowance, home help income is exempted from means tests for certain social welfare recipients and adult dependant allowance is being extended for six months after death.  These are just some of the improvements in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions to support labour intensive industries.  These include a reduction in employers' PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent for employees earning up to £173 per week, the two year exemption scheme, the exemption of health contributions and training levies and the withdrawal of liability on employers of medical card holders to pay levies.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on ensuring a more friendly approach by the staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  The officials with whom I have had contact in the past in my constituency work have been most helpful and friendly and I have received positive reports in this regard from my constituents.  I wish to highlight the benefit of the social welfare leaflets issued by the Department from time to time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address a number of issues, one of which relates to people who made contributions prior to 1954 and who are unable to obtain benefit because those contributions are disregarded. The Minister should address the anomalies in this area.  While I appreciate there is an EU regulation on the one stamp rule, this is an issue on which we should make strong representations to our EU colleagues.  I hope progress will be made in this regard.  Consideration <Col N="1392" /> should also be given to the question of equal treatment payments and arrears of certain payments, a matter which will come before the courts.  I would appreciate the Minister addressing the inequities in this area.</P>
    <P>My views on the carer's allowance are on record.  The Departments of Social Welfare and Health should work together in this area in which there is great potential.</P>
    <P>The social welfare bill of £3.8 billion is a huge burden on the State.  I think all Members would agree that there is a black economy and abuse of the social welfare system.  Special consideration has to be given to these issues.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the one week stamp.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I readily accept that this problem has been caused by an EU regulation, which I regard as very stupid.  I know from his remarks that the Minister has tried to deal with this problem and I would encourage him to continue his efforts in this regard.  It is unfair that a person who has worked and paid stamps in a European country should have to try to get one week's work so as to qualify for benefit.  If he could get a week's work he could probably stay working and would not require unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I refer to the criteria governing eligibilty for unemployment assistance as it relates to people living at home.  It is stupid that people can be told their board and lodgings at home are worth, say, £30 to them, yet they will get a rent allowance and full unemployment assistance if they move out of home and get a flat.  The costings of this system should be worked out by the Department and a figure set for board and lodgings.  I have never understood how board and lodgings can be estimated at £39 in one case and at a different figure in another case.  The Minister should ascertain the number of people living in flats who are receiving full unemployment assistance and a rent allowance.  The State could make enormous savings if these people were allowed to stay at home and and a reasonable amount was deducted for board and lodgings.  I have never understood how this system works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the Department's investigation unit, two aspects of whose work I find strange.  The people working <Col N="1395" /> in this unit examine the books in employment exchanges to see when people signed off.  They then visit the employers and they spend a long time going through their books.  If they find that one day does not correspond in both books the person involved will receive a letter telling him that on an unspecified day between 3 and 20 May he worked and claimed unemployment benefit.  If the investigation unit knows the specific date it should give it. It is not worth this unit's while chasing honest people who go to the bother of signing off on the one or two days a week they are working.  I think the problem arises when the employer enters a wrong date in his books which does not correspond with the date in the employment exchanges books.  Even though the person involved may be very honest he will automatically be accused of working on a day he was signing on.  I have examples of such cases.  The deployment of staff on this work is both indefensible and costly and the staff could be better employed in other work.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position of wives who can earn, I think, £60 per week and who are barely over the limit.  I cannot understand why the hammer should be brought to bear on people who are £2 over the limit and why they should be treated as though they were chancing their arm.  Mercy and judgement should come into play in such cases.  Why would anyone risk losing an allowance of £35 for the sake of £2?  I know a person who has been asked to pay a refund of £7,000 merely because his wife, who works a few hours in a rather difficult job, in her innocence was £2 or £3 over the limit each time?  The system should not be so black and white.  Obviously consideration has to be given to a person's intentions in such cases, but it is indefensible that a person who is £1 over the limit should have to suffer the entire consequences. No one would dream of breaking the rules in order to get an extra £1 or £2 per week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made in regard to old age pensioners living alone, that they will now be allowed to keep certain <Col N="1396" /> allowances such as free telephone rental. This represents a breath of fresh air in the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not understand, however, why the Department give free fuel allowances of only £5 per week to old age pensioners who live alone.  If a pensioner's relative spends a night in his or her home, the free fuel allowance will be taken off them. Houses have been examined by Department officials to see if there were any adjoining doors between apartments where old people live in separate accommodation. In one case, because there was a door between the two sections of the house, the old person was not deemed eligible for the free fuel allowance.  Why is the Department acting in such a mean fashion by requiring old people to live alone in order to qualify for these allowances.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill next year the Minister will say to me that he listened to the points I raised.  He has made some improvements, namely, the free telephone rental, but I hope that a person will not be required to live alone to qualify for the free fuel allowance.  If these people are entitled to a free fuel allowance what difference does it make whether or not they are living alone?  Is it not better that three or four people would get the benefit from this free fuel?</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the allowance made for widows, which shows an element of care.  It would not do for us in Opposition to say that a measure was perfect but it is sad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i>&mdash;&mdash;that a widow who has all the allowances and who may be younger than 60 years of age will be worse off financially when her husband dies.  She will experience all the additional pressures that her husband's death entails but without the benefit of the allowances that she had previously.  I realise there is a cost factor involved in this but whether a widow is 32, 42 or 52 she suffers a great sense <Col N="1397" /> of loss in addition to the difficulties of rearing a family.  I would encourage the Minister to reduce the age limit to below 60 because it affects so many people.  I met a woman last week who told me she felt humiliated that the allowances to which she was entitled when her husband was alive disappeared when he died.  His death was a great loss but she had the additional burden of being treated as a second class citizen on his death.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the free travel scheme.  One of the issues I raised when I first came into this House was free travel for companions of those with a free travel pass.  I raised this matter also with the health board.  There is little point giving a pass to some people if they are unable to avail of it on their own.  I welcome any extension of the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance has been much debated in this House.  I thank the Minister for increasing the qualification allowance by ignoring the first £100.  That will bring more people into the scheme although the figures that have been given appear to indicate that not many people have been brought into the scheme.  This scheme can save costs, particularly in regard to hospital beds and it is unfortunate that more people cannot be brought into the scheme.</P>
      <P>The home help scheme has been referred to by most Members this afternoon. We cannot continue with a scheme that basically involves slave labour. Offering a person £1 or £2 an hour is nothing more than that.  We should seriously consider how we treat these people who do not engage in this work for the money they might earn; they do it because they are kind.  Who would work for £2 an hour if they were seriously trying to make money?  We are cashing in on the generosity and kindness of people who care for the elderly in particular, many of whom would end up in hospital but for the visits of these home helps. Paying such a low salary is difficult to defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy the Minister realises that is fearr rith maith ná droch-sheasamh, a good run is better than a bad stand, <Col N="1398" /> because he retreated quickly in regard to the widows.  He was right to do this because it would have had unfortunate consequences.</P>

For the sake of widows I am glad he took such action because the principle involved has serious consequences for everybody.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to adopt a major stand on behalf of the farming community who at the moment are receiving so much publicity one would imagine they were all millionaires.  I am, however, aware of a case of a farmer with 15 acres whose income was assessed on those acres.  I inquired from the Department of Social Welfare what it thought the bigger farmers were earning.  It can be unrealistic to assess a farmer's means on a per acre basis.  If one were to travel down the country and observe some of the fields that are presently flooded, and if one calculated a theoretical income based on expert opinion from Teagasc, An Foras Talúntais &mdash; and the Minister worked for some of those institutions so he should understand the theory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the good wishes that have been afforded to the Minister and his Minister of State in bringing about considerable changes in this area in such a short period of time. Before the last general election it was well known that the Labour Party was critical of the Department of Social Welfare and the dirty dozen cuts that were implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> I am glad to say that these cuts have been almost entirely abolished through welcome action by the Minister and the Minister of State over the past year. Some of our colleagues on the Opposition benches would like to give the impression that these changes have not been made.  However, they have been effected, thus honouring a commitment in the general election.  I am very glad that such was the response of the Minister and his Department.  Most reasonable, fair-minded people would agree that the Minister went as far as he could to reverse those unfair cuts.</P>
    <P>I am Chairman of the Social Affairs Committee of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary body.  We had a meeting recently of three Members of the British Parliament and five Members of this House with the Minister for Social Welfare. He readily agreed to talk about problems which had arisen <i>vis-à-vis</i> our emigrants living in Britain and those returning here who experienced difficulties in claiming benefits and as a result of fluctuations in our respective currencies.  The financial crisis of the winter of 1992 led to severe cutbacks for people residing here deriving their benefits from the British Department of Health and Social Security.  The Minister enlightened our committee on the steps taken to ensure that such fluctuations would not have a detrimental impact on low incomes, particularly those of pensioners.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the reaction of our British counterparts on that committee to the huge range of benefits provided by our Department of Social Welfare for beneficiaries.  We are inclined to regard legislative moves in Britain as progressive and tend to adopt them in many areas. Many of the British Labour Members of Parliament at that meeting were almost stunned by the amount of material and information the Department of Social Welfare was able to provide, demonstrating the advances we have made over and above their welfare state which has been lauded worldwide.</P>
    <P>The free social welfare schemes operated here are so far ahead of those applicable <Col N="1401" /> in Britain that the latter pale into insignificance.  In Britain the free travel concession is applicable to a very narrow range of areas.  If one lives in London one can avail of London Transport at given times but, if one lives in an area where there is private transport only available, one cannot use it.  Certainly one could not travel free from London to, say, Glasgow to visit a relative or travel on business from one part of Britain to another.  They found our system an interesting concept.  I pointed out that one of the additional benefits of free travel in this country is the promotion of the tourism industry in that people of pensionable age can avail of attractive offers.</P>
    <P>Our living alone allowance attracted very favourable comment by those British Members of Parliament, in addition to our free telephone rental allowance and free fuel allowance which are almost unheard of in Britain, although their citizens do reap some benefits in those areas. This led them to question our capability to afford such allowances.  Nonetheless it demonstrated the social conscience successive Governments have shown regarding older citizens dependent on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very forthcoming with regard to the report we will be bringing before the plenary session of the British-Irish Interparliamentary body at the end of April next.  I hope he will accept an invitation to meet the whole body on that occasion because I can assure him his fame has spread well beyond these shores.</P>
    <P>There are one or two areas in which we can look forward to continued improvements implemented by the Department.  My colleague, Deputy Ferris, mentioned taking the benefits of social welfare into another area, that of the Department of the Environment.  I refer to the operation of the differential rents scheme by local authorities.  I do not know whether things in my county move at a faster pace but differential rents have already been revised by Wicklow County Council, whereas the social welfare benefits will accrue somewhat <Col N="1402" /> later.  I dealt with two cases yesterday, one of single parent, whose differential rent had been increased by £4 per week and another case of an unemployed man, with a wife and five children, whose differential rent had been increased by £9 per week.  It is time the Ministers for Social Welfare and the Environment got together and requested local authorities to demonstrate the types of changes they are effecting and the regulations they operate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the differential rents scheme.  For example, it would be of great benefit if their escalation were confined, say, to something like 10 per cent of the value of the increase in social welfare benefit.  With the enormous pressure for funds at local authority level one has the impression that service charges, commercial and industrial rates and rents from local authority houses are being increased without regard to ability to pay.  Perhaps the Minister could meet his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who I predict would be willing to examine the type of changes taking place at local level.  People receive an increase in social welfare benefit but find it wiped out months before it accrues in their pension books.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that people over 75 years of age and no longer living alone will retain their entitlement to telephone allowance.  While it is not a costly benefit it means so much to people who must depend on relatives living with them on reaching that age.  The taking away of such benefit was an anomaly which is being abolished.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister also on the various grants allocated to various bodies such as the Women's Refuge, the Organisation for Homeless Boys, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the ICTU Centres for the Unemployed. This money is of great benefit to those who give their time to these centres.  Many of them are unemployed. I thank the Minister for meeting with the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and I hope that his meeting with the Minister for the Environment, which I have suggested, will be held as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Kavanagh, I will meet with the Minister for the Environment and pursue the matter. A number of Deputies raised the question of Irish emigrants in the UK in light of the recent statements by the British Secretary of State for Social Security that he proposes to introduce a residence test for people seeking certain social welfare payments.  He proposes to introduce a habitual residence test which will be applied in determining entitlement to income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.  We discussed this earlier in the House and pursued it in the <Col N="1404" /> meantime.  I will travel to the UK tomorrow and have discussions with the British Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Lilley, regarding the proposal.  I am concerned about the effect of such a change on Irish emigrants and on the rights of Irish people living in Britain.</P>
      <P>In the course of the meeting I hope to clarify the proposed measures and their effects on Irish people.  I will raise the compatibility of the proposals with established practice whereby Irish and British people are not treated as foreigners under the respective residence and work arrangements in each country and whether the proposals comply with EU law.  Under the Irish social welfare arrangements, British and Irish citizens have access to social welfare payments on an equal basis.  There were more than 4,000 non-Irish people most of whom are British, drawing unemployment payments at the beginning of this month. In addition 12,500 people in receipt of British pensions who live here also benefit under one or more free schemes such as free travel or telephone rental.  It is important to maintain this good working relationship which is a long established feature of the Irish and British systems and which was referred to in the parliamentary group mentioned by Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of employers having an incentive to create jobs.  We are happy to see the package of £89 million in PRSI measures in the Bill.  Two-thirds of all employers will benefit from this package.  It is up to them to give a return in terms of retaining jobs and creating new ones.  It is an investment by Government on behalf of taxpayers.  If it were matched by one new job in each of the 80,000 companies which will benefit, the effect on the unemployment figures would be dramatic. Deputies welcomed the incentive. We should not underestimate its importance, the size of its impact or what it means as regards the social insurance fund.  It is only because the fund is in such a strong position at present that we were able to do this.  I am glad the Small Firms <Col N="1405" /> Association welcomed this package of measures today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen asked me to make a statement on the equal treatment provisions and to clarify the matter.  A number of Deputies, including Deputies De Rossa, Gilmore, Martin, Bradford and Quill, sought clarification.  As I explained on several occasions, court proceedings were initiated seeking retrospective payments in a number of cases, some going back as far as 1985.  In the absence of implementing measures settlements were made in such cases. Deputies will be aware of the provisions of retrospective legislation which, in general terms, entitled married women to the payments they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented on time.  These provisions addressed the problems arising from the delay in implementing the directive in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner. All the entitlements due under the retrospective legislation have now been paid.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the retrospective legislation legal proceedings have been initiated in 60 cases involving 5,000 plaintiffs.  These proceedings are being defended by my Department and, ultimately, the matter will be determined by the courts.  A number of cases will come for hearing in the High Court in the next few months. My Department will not make settlements in any of these cases.  This means <Col N="1406" /> these proceedings will determine whether women affected by the delay have any legal entitlements over and above those provided for in the retrospective legislation.  If the courts decide no such entitlement exists this will finalise the matter.  If they decide they have an entitlement the necessary payments will be made to all those involved in accordance with the decision of the court.  The court cases are pending and will be defended.  That will settle the matter once and for all.</P>

The legal entitlements are provided for in the retrospective legislation and all payments have been made in full.  The decisions of the European Court do not create any additional entitlements as these decisions were made in advance of implementing measures.  The retrospective legislation brought into force in June 1992 put in place implementing measures which made good the default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill asked me to address the question of transitional payments which were made to cushion families against the loss of increases for dependants suffered by men on the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986.  If these payments had not been made, the weekly income of certain families dependent on social welfare would have been reduced.  Married women did not suffer any loss of payment when equal treatment came into force, the complete opposite was the case.  Married women received a higher personal rate of payment and qualified for increases for dependants.  There is no justification for making transitional payments in these <Col N="1407" /> circumstances.  What Deputy Quill and others are seeking also involves making double payments in certain circumstances. This means paying some couples two personal rates of payment, two adult dependant increases and double increases for children.  As Deputies will be aware, this is a very complex issue.  Many arguments can be made in defence of the claims for payments in addition to those provided for in the retrospective legislation.  The point I want to emphasise here today is that all legal entitlements have been paid.  The claims currently being proceeded with will be determined by the courts and if this gives rise to additional entitlements, all those involved will be paid in accordance with the decision of the court.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to immediately initiate the necessary legal proceedings to prevent commissioning of the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) at Sellafield in view of the fact that the Government has cited at least three EU Directives which the plant will contravene and given that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. has indicated that it will be ready to begin reprocessing at THORP from 7th March, 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent's motion gives us an opportunity to discuss this important matter.  Obviously I will be supporting the Government's amendment. The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria poses the single biggest threat to out national environment and to our people.  The decision of the UK authorities to sanction THORP, which is due to commence operating on 7 March 1994, is extremely regrettable.  I suggest it flies in the face of democracy.  The public has been treated with contempt. Despite a request for a full scale public inquiry by individuals, organisations and institutions, including the Irish Government, which made submissions in January and October 1993, no such inquiry was held.  The UK consultative process was a sham, given that the decision was taken to proceed with the plant without the necessary public inquiry.  The Irish Government's thoroughly researched and well presented case in its two submissions were disregarded completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> There is a history of accidents at nuclear plants, for example, the Chernobyl disaster.  There is also history of accidents in British Nuclear Fuels plants at Sellafield.  A parliamentary question was tabled yesterday to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications but he was unable to give details of the list of accidents at the Sellafield plant.  He stated that the exact location and other specific details of the incidents are supplied by the UK authority on a confidential basis under informal procedures agreed at meetings of the Ireland-UK contact group on nuclear safety.  Consequently he was not at liberty to disclose such specifics.  That is regrettable. I understand that the health and safety executive in the UK published such a list of accidents and it would be helpful to Members if we could have a list of the incidents that have taken place at this plant.  We should have this information.</P>
    <P>The British Radiological Protection Authority has stated that in the UK THORP will increase cancer deaths from radiation by 200 for each year of its operation.  That is a startling statement. The greatest fear is of the unknown.  We do not know the effects of increased emissions and discharges from the extended plant at Sellafield.  Studies by Dr. Patricia Sheehan have shown some medical evidence of clusters of cancers and that the expanded plant will have an effect on the health of people in this country.  The greatest threat, however, is a threat of a nuclear accident. This is a new plant, using new technology and expertise and the chances of an accident are probably greater in these circumstances. There is also a threat arising from the storage and disposal of nuclear waste.  In the past the proposed repository was found to be unsafe and the long term consequences are unknown.  The transportation of uranium and plutonium through the Irish Sea also poses a threat and there is no need to point out that there have been accidents and collisions at sea.  There is therefore, a risk associated with increased exposure to radiation, <Col N="1414" /> to public health and of environmental damage.</P>
    <P>The Government is considering all the options, diplomatic and legal, to bring about the closure of Sellafield and I congratulate the Minister on his efforts to date.  A legal action in Britain or the European Court, under European or international law, must be an option. Before we go down this road we need a strong, sustainable case as failure could make a bad situation worse.  I call on the Minister and the Attorney General to keep this matter under review.</P>
    <P>It makes little sense to proceed with THORP.  Since expansion was first suggested the economic considerations have changed while the strategic and security reasons are no longer as important as they once were for the United Kingdom authorities.  It is regrettable that a quick decision was taken to proceed with the proposed expansion.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is a menace, we must continue our efforts to bring about its closure and oppose the operation of THORP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Haughey and welcome the motion tabled by Deputy Sargent as it reflects the concern expressed about the threat THORP and Sellafield pose to health and the environment.  I congratulate Deputy Sargent on the stand he has taken; he has been steadfastly opposed to Sellafield and THORP.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and the Government are at one on this issue.  I welcome its amendment which categorically states it is Government policy to bring about the closure of Sellafield and THORP.  People are frustrated and impatient because we have been able to achieve little or nothing despite the constant complaints on both medical and environmental grounds. There have been clusters of cases involving leukaemia and other forms of cancer and stillbirths, the finger is being pointed at Sellafield although it would be difficult to take a successful legal case on medical grounds.  There has also been damage to marine life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with two issues Sellafield nuclear power station is now an <Col N="1415" /> old plant.  In the 1960s and 1970s we contemplated the possibility of constructing a similar station at Carnsore, County Wexford, which was the subject of a heated debate.  Hardly a citizen would now be in favour of constructing a nuclear power station on this island. Views and technology change and there is no longer the same emphasis on the use of nuclear power in meeting our energy requirements.</P>
    <P>We must continue to monitor Sellafield and ensure that we gather as much information as possible.  I hope that some day we will be able to bring about its closure. THORP is a horse of a different colour and we need to implement the lessons we learned from Sellafield.  We could question the viability, the value and purpose of THORP, and the Minister was very trenchant in his views last night.</P>
    <P>The costs associated with THORP are enormous.  The figure of £3 billion has been mentioned.  Given that most of this has already been invested it will be extremely difficult to prevent the project from proceeding.</P>
    <P>Questions must be raised about its location.  When British Nuclear Fuels was considering possible locations Sellafield was not considered the most suitable. There are problems with the rock formation surrounding the deep cavern selected.  A site in Scotland would have been far more suitable but, for economic reasons, Sellafield was chosen.</P>
    <P>The purpose of THORP is to produce 50 tonnes of plutonium during the next decade at a time when plutonium is no longer regarded at a useful energy source. It is more likely that THORP will be used as a storage area for unwanted fuel.  I am concerned that this will be stockpiled in an area where leaks were reported during tests.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the arguments succinctly in his submissions in January and October last year.  He suggested that a public inquiry should be held but, regrettably, this was rejected by British Nuclear Fuels and the British Government. The Minister also suggested that an <Col N="1416" /> environmental impact assessment should be carried out but this, too, was rejected.</P>
    <P>I hope we will associate ourselves with the case being taken by Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council who are seeking a judicial review of the legality of the British Government's decision to grant a licence to THORP.  It would have been beneficial if we could have been associated with or even initiated that.  I know the constraints on the Minister, but the question could be opened up if we got a public inquiry based on the case made by Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council.</P>
    <P>The question of whether there is a basis for legal action can be looked at from two angles.  The Minister has already listed three directives that BNFL are in breach of because of the absence of an environmental impact assessment, a balance between the dangers of exposure to radiation and the benefits to society, and lack of freedom of access to information.  On those three grounds alone there is a case to be made.  Whether it would be successful is open to argument.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government should be seen to be doing everything in its power to ensure that all steps are taken to prevent the commissioning of THORP.  Diplomatic measures have been taken, including the exertion of pressure at every level in the European Union, via the Paris and London Dumping Conventions, the International Economic Energy Agency, etc.  Even though there is doubt about the outcome, we must take a chance on there being a successful conclusion to any action we might take in the domestic or international media.  In the light of the number of EC directives that have been ignored in the development of THORP it would be in our interest to take legal action.  Even if it were not successful it would be seen that we take the health of our people and the totality of our environment, both on land and at sea, with the greatest seriousness.  The danger is that once THORP is in operation it will be virtually impossible to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment but we must remember that on this issue time is precious <Col N="1417" /> and if we leave it too late it will not be possible to take action.  It can only be taken before THORP is fully operational.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of speaking to this motion.  The Government is deeply concerned about this and the Minister has done all in his power to deal with it.  I hope the situation can be reviewed with a view to taking legal action on the grounds already submitted to the UK Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Broughan.  I welcome this motion and congratulate Deputy Sargent on putting it down.  The apprehensions of the Irish public about Sellafield are well founded.  People have a deep mistrust of what goes on in Sellafield, what went on in Windscale and now what may happen when THORP gets under way.  Over the years we have heard half-truths and lies from BNFL on matters within the plant in Sellafield.  People should be very concerned and we should constantly remind BNFL, the British Government and the British public of the dangers of nuclear fuels and the record of Sellafield and Windscale.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Greenpeace, who have been very good at briefing politicians on events in Sellafield and have done much work on this issue, as has Lancashire County Council.  They gave Dublin Corporation much help and supplied briefing notes on various issues.  When I was chairman of the planning committee we took the first ever objection from outside Great Britain to the power plant at Hinckley Point.  That was the first time an objection from somebody outside England was accepted as being appropriate. Although we did not get very far with it, we got much help from Greenpeace and others and broke new ground. It is because of that original case taken by Dublin Corporation that BNFL are listening to us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of European Union regulations BNFL had to get an environmental impact study when applying for the licence for THORP.  However, that was not carried out by an independent <Col N="1418" /> body but by themselves.  Nobody should be allowed to carry out an environmental impact study on something they are doing themselves.  One only has to look at the history of BNFL to realise how crazy it was to allow them to carry out such a study.  Their record is poor.  Originally there was Windscale.  Then the name was changed to Sellafield and now there is the THORP plant within the Sellafield complex.</P>
    <P>It has not been definitely proven that Sellafield is the cause of health problems, but there is disturbing evidence and we are reminded of clusters of people on the east coast of Ireland and on the west coast of England and Wales who may have been affected by radiation.  When I visited Sellafield some years ago many people told me of their concerns in regard to the plant.  The visit was an eye opener in the sense that I realised there are plenty of jobs in the area and that many of those working in the plant are unsympathetic to lobbying against Sellafield and THORP.</P>
    <P>This Government's policy is consistent with that of previous Governments in trying to close Sellafield.  There are two legal possibilities.  The first is to take a case to the European Court.  The Minister explained the Government's position in that regard and I believe he is correct.  If we took a case to the European court and lost it we would be in a very weak position in future.  The Minister outlined the arguments for and against taking a case to the European Court and his record proves that he will not shy away from a good fight if he believes he might win.  A second opinion is to take a case against the suppliers of radioactive material to our national courts to ascertain if local requirements are being breached.  The Minister should examine that option because there is major controversy in France about the disposal of nuclear waste.  When THORP is up and running the French may no longer dispose of their nuclear waste, they may dump it in the THORP plant which will get bigger and bigger.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and support the Minister's amendment to the motion as I <Col N="1419" /> fought a case against Sellafield for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my third or fourth time to speak on this matter, I was the first Member to raise the issue in the 27th Dáil.  The Minister is moving towards the view of the majority of this House, namely, that sooner or later we will have to take a definitive legal stand on THORP.  My colleague referred to the implications of losing a case in the European Court, if we lose we face the prospect of years of contamination from krypton 85 gas and iodine and there will still be 200 cases of cancer every year.  I would not mind losing such a case, but I would like to have a go.  The Minister has an outstanding record in his field and has unravelled many problems, I ask him to deal with this one head on.</P>
      <P>I commend my colleague for suggesting we should take legal action against the German and Japanese companies, who send shiploads of nuclear waste up and down our coastline on a regular basis.  That is unacceptable.  Will we have a revamped Irish Navy or British or European Navy policing our coastline in an effort to protect us from contamination in the case of an accident.  As our consultant in Dublin City Council, John H. Large, stated, one cannot insure one's house against a nuclear accident.  I congratulate the Minister on his submissions and for the brave stand he took at the Paris and Oslo Conventions, but I urge him to take a step further.  Under Directive 85/337 a legal case could be taken against Minister Gummer to make him reconsider his position and against the operators of the utilities which will contaminate our seas and air in the years ahead.  I commend the Minister for his approach and urge him to take further action.</P>

      <P>While I fully recognise the difficulties in the way of legal action as set out in the Minister's speech last night, nonetheless the Progressive Democrats will vote in support of this motion as an expression of our deeply felt concern at the imminent commissioning of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield which is due to come into operation within a matter of days.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in THORP at Sellafield is not simply an extension of an existing conventional nuclear reactor producing thermal energy from nuclear fuel.  THORP consists of a reprocessing plant which will gather nuclear waste from many countries, particularly Japan. From this waste, unused uranium is salvaged for reuse, in addition, 7,000 kg of plutonium will be produced annually.  As well as the reprocessed uranium and the plutonium, there will be substantial quantities of residual waste which will, of course, be heavily radioactive and which cannot be disposed of in a safe and permanent way in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>To what use will this plutonium be put? It was envisaged 20 years ago, when the THORP project was planned, that there would be up to 700 fast breeder reactors in the Western World by the year 2000 which would require plutonium as a fuel. In fact the development of nuclear technology has been such that, outside Japan, there are scarcely any fast breeder reactors who would require to buy plutonium from Sellafield.  Uranium has remained surprisingly cheap and it is available in adequate quantities.  It is very unlikely that further fast breeder reactors will be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other use for plutonium is military.  There are a relatively small number of countries with a military nuclear capacity and many of those that have such capacity are decommissioning their weapons.  The Cold War is over and I hope there will not be a requirement for plutonium for military purposes again.  The availability of large quantities of plutonium is simply an encouragement to certain lunatic regimes to develop <Col N="1421" /> nuclear weapons.  It is also an encouragement to terrorists to get their hands on plutonium when the consequences could be catastrophic for millions of people.  Within a few years, the stockpile of plutonium at Sellafield will be by far the largest in the world, it may well become a focal point for terrorists and we have our share of those in this part of the world.</P>
    <P>All the incoming waste, the outgoing plutonium and enriched uranium will have to travel by ship on the Irish Sea. These ships, which are potentially vulnerable to an accident at any time, will travel within 30 miles of our coast. The Irish Sea is narrow and shallow.  It simply could not absorb a significant quantity of radiation if one of those ships sank.  The British Government, who owns British Nuclear Fuels, has given all sorts of assurances about safety but it is doubtful whether its assurances can be accepted or believed.</P>
    <P>Right back to the beginnings of Sellafield, or Windscale as it was then known, in the early 1950s, there have been various leakages and accidents.  British Nuclear Fuels Limited has an unenviable record for telling lies and covering up. Two of the accidents were particularly serious, the Windscale disaster in 1957 and the major accident at the Headend reprocessing plant in 1973 which has remained shut since then.  Why should British Nuclear Fuels Limited be believed now when experience over the last 40 years shows it had no entitlement to be believed during that long period?</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister set out at some length the various legal options from which he felt we were cut off and which were not open to us.  I do not agree with all the views he expressed.  In particular, his statement that &ldquo;any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.  No such evidence is available as yet however&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That strikes me as insupportable as a legal proposition.  Both Irish and English law allow for relief known as a <i>quia timet</i> injunction &mdash; to restrain the use or retention <Col N="1422" /> of something which is inherently seriously dangerous.  It is not necessary to wait until there is scientific evidence of damage done, if there is inherently a potential serious danger in either the process or in the storage of hazardous materials.  If my neighbour wanted to store in a large tank a substantial quantity of petrol overground against my fence I have no doubt that I could get an injunction to restrain him or her.  It would be a curious jurisprudence that did not allow for such an injunction.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to have evidence of the kind the Minister says is necessary for the simple reason that the plant is not yet in operation.  By definition we cannot have the evidence, but is the legal position one that if we are not fried alive we can take no proceedings?  Does the Minister or the Attorney General want to defend that proposition?  On the Minister's reasoning, it would not be open to us as a country to take proceedings unless some of our citizens were either dead or seriously injured by radiation. That is an absurd proposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that one of the potential legal fora which we looked at is the International Court of Justice at The Hague.  It seems that that is a court to which we might have recourse because under international law it is not permissible for one country to carry on activities within its borders which would be seriously damaging to another country. However, Ireland cannot resort to the International Court of Justice at The Hague because while we accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the first such court in the 1920s and 1930s, we have never acceded to the compulsory jurisdiction of the post-1945 court.  The rules of the court are that if one does not accept its jurisdiction as a defendent one is not entitled to seek its protections as a plaintiff; that is common sense.  We are estopped from going to The Hague at present, but because of the importance of this issue to Ireland, would it not be worth our while accepting the jurisdiction of The Hague Court so that we could, if so advised, initiate an action under international law, as opposed to Community <Col N="1423" /> law, against the United Kingdom?</P>
    <P>The British are believed to have expended nearly £3,000 million on THORP.  They claim it will be profitable, but I doubt that.  They are trying to get some of their money back.  They are doing so in the mid-1990s in circumstances that are totally different to the commercial and technological climate that existed in the mid-1970s when this decision was made.  Are they entitled to do so at the potential expense of millions of their own citizens and of our citizens? The Progressive Democrats believe the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years now there has been unanimity amongst all parties in this House in opposing the continued operation of the British nuclear fuel plant at Sellafield where spent nuclear fuel is chemically re-processed to extract uranium and plutonium.  As we know the Sellafield site contains Calder Hall, the first industrial scale nuclear power station as well as the new thermal oxide re-processing plant, THORP.  A vitrification plant for high level radioactive waste was also commissioned on the site in 1991. On 23 July 1991, UK Nirex Ltd., the British nuclear fuel industry's waste disposal executive, announced that it had chosen Sellafield as the site at which it would concentrate its further investigations for the development of an underground repository for intermediate and low level radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's case for the closure of the Sellafield complex is based on the belief that the Sellafield plant is inherently unsafe.  The Minister, and his predecessors in office over the past number of years have on numerous occasions requested the United Kingdom Government to close Sellafield and emphasised Ireland's total opposition to the plant. The questionable safety standards at the plant, its history of mismanagement and the frequency of accidents and other incidents there in the past, confirm the view that the only way to resolve concerns <Col N="1424" /> about Sellafield would be to close it down.</P>
    <P>The coming on stream of THORP will pose additional risks for the Irish public as it will mean greater levels of waste on site, more discharges to the environment and the transportation of material to and from Sellafield.  The THORP plant, now due to come into operation, is the largest single expansion at Sellafield; it will reprocess spent fuel rods from light water nuclear reactors, extracting uranium for re-use and also plutonium.  It was one of the largest civil engineering projects in Britain, costing nearly £3 billion.  It was approved by the United Kingdom Government in 1978 following a protracted public inquiry and parliamentary debates and has, I understand, a lifespan of about 25 years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley outlined, the United Kingdom Government see Sellafield as an important source of foreign currency and British Nuclear Fuels is understood to have already received orders in excess of £9 billion for the reprocessing of spent fuel at THORP, with the UK nuclear utilities and with a number of Japanese, German and other customers.</P>
    <P>Under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, operations at the Sellafield plant could not begin until British Nuclear Fuels Limited formally received the European Commission's opinion on discharges from the plant.  The Commission, however, concluded that the implementation of the plan to dispose of radioactive waste from the THORP plant was not liable either in normal operation or in accident conditions to result in contamination from the point of view of health, water, soil or the air space of another member state.  Notwithstanding this opinion, it continues to be the unanimous view of all parties in the Dáil that all discharges into the marine or aerial environment from nuclear installations should be prevented and eliminated by the use of the best available technology and environmental practices.  The extension of Sellafield facilities through the bringing on stream of the THORP plant poses additional risks for the Irish public <Col N="1425" /> and all parties in the House must continue to strongly object to it.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister for Energy, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland examined the consequences for this country of the operation of THORP.  The assessment was done on the basis of data supplied by British Nuclear Fuels regarding the quantities of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents to be discharged from this plant. The liquid effluent normally discharged into the Irish Sea from THORP will contain predominantly tritium, but also several other radionuclides, including caesium, ruthenium and plutonium.  The institute estimated that these discharges would give rise to an annual radiation dose of about 1 microsievert to a heavy consumer of seafood caught off the east coast of Ireland.  This will add to the dose of 4.6 microsieverts received by the same consumer in 1990, due to the accumulated effect of discharges up to that time, as determined from the institute's analysis of fish caught in the Irish Sea in that year.</P>
    <P>The principal radionuclide in the gaseous discharge from THORP will be krypton 85.  It was estimated that this discharge would, at the maximum of the plant, give rise to an annual dose to a member of the public here of about 0.1 microsievert.  The dose arising from the gaseous discharges for all activities at Sellafield is estimated to be a few times this amount.</P>
    <P>The average annual dose received by a member of the Irish public from all sources of radiation is about 4,000 microsieverts. When THORP is in full operation, therefore, the total radiation dose which will be received by the most exposed member of the Irish public due to all routine discharges from Sellafield will still amount to no more than a fraction of 1 per cent of that received by a person in Ireland from all natural and artificial sources of radioactivity.  At least that was the conclusion of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland at that time as reported to me.</P>
    <P>However, an additional major concern to Ireland is of course the risk of an <Col N="1426" /> unplanned release of radioactivity due to a serious accident at Sellafield.  The institute considered the possible consequences of the types of accident which one could reasonably visualise as happening to THORP and which would result in discharges into the Irish Sea or to the atmosphere, depending on the nature of the accident.</P>
    <P>From an accident giving rise to atmosphere discharges, the estimated highest dose to an adult living at the nearest point in Ireland to Sellafield, and eating only locally produced food, would be approximately 70 microsieverts.  A dose to a heavy consumer of seafood from an accident resulting in a liquid discharge into the Irish Sea, would be approximately 120 microsieverts.  These doses could be reduced if short term restrictions were placed on the consumption of certain foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>For comparison, the dose received by an Irish adult due to the Chernobyl accident was estimated in the range of 120-150 microsieverts.  The conclusion of the institute was that while all discharges of radioactivity from Sellafield are undesirable, any increase in them would be even more undesirable.  The additional radiation doses to a member of the Irish public from the THORP plant, either in normal operation or in certain foreseeable accident scenarios would not be such as to cause a significantly increased risk to health.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House wanted to see all discharges of radioactivity into the marine and aerial environment progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated. It cannot be emphasised too much that the occurrence of an accident in THORP or elsewhere at Sellafield, with consequences more serious than those mentioned above, cannot be ruled out and remains a serious and legitimate concern for this country.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note in the Minister's speech last night reference to the intensification of the programme for the monitoring of contamination levels in the Irish Sea to determine the effects of radioactive discharges on the Irish marine environment and the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> In my time as Minister for Energy, I pressed the Attorney General throughly to investigate the possibilities of taking legal action against British Nuclear Fuels and the United Kingdom Government over Sellafield, but I was continually advised that no case had been identified. As Minister, I publicly expressed my commitment to take legal action if a sufficient case could be shown to exist, but had to accept the Attorney General's advice that the Government could not initiate legal action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>It proved difficult to find convincing evidence to establish a direct cause and effect link between the Sellafield operation and health effects in Ireland and there was no evidence to suggest that the activities at the Sellafield plant were in breach of European Union law.  The Law of the Sea, the Paris Convention, the United Kingdom Courts and the International Court of Justice were all looked at by the Attorney General and the same obstacle existed &mdash; lack of sufficient evidence. As THORP has not come into operation, evidence in that regard could not be factually presented.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the United Kingdom Government has ignored all our expressions of concern.  It has contemptuously dismissed them, claiming that the highest safety standards are applied and that its nuclear plants are as safe as man can make them.  Man's knowledge in this area is limited.</P>
    <P>As has been so well outlined by Deputy Sargent, much remains unknown about these dangerous substances.  Arrogant British claims about their safety standards will be of little comfort here if there is a Chernoby1-type accident at Sellafield, which is only 70 miles from our east coast. I know the horror of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, having met a group of survivors of that explosion whose bodies were maimed, disfigured and distorted by radiation.  In recent times, a survivor of Chernoby1 visited my home, and the future life of that young person is bleak in the extreme due to the horrific effects of exposure to radiation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> I recognise the dangers of the scenario outlined by Deputy Sargent.  We are not complacent in this House about these dangers, but it is most frustrating that an otherwise fairly friendly neighbour, the United Kingdom Government, is continuing contemptuously to dismiss our genuine fears.  Even our attempts to get the European Union to agree to an EU inspection force to examine all nuclear installations within the community, including the Sellafield plant, within the competence of Chapter 3 of Euratom Treaty has failed to get community-wide acceptance.  Every possible opportunity was availed of by the Department of Energy in my time to win support at European Union level for this independent inspection force, but the selfish interests of member states with nuclear power succeeded in blocking progress.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to continue to investigate the possibilities of legal action.  He would have the full support of the Progressive Democrats.  He should continue to press the United Kingdom to change its attitude and recognise the genuine fears of the Irish people about the threat posed by the Sellafield plant to all on this island.  He should continue to press also at European Union level for a positive response in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Sargent on placing this motion before the House.  Since I became a Member I have had an opportunity to participate in debates on the activities of British Nuclear Fuels Limited at Sellafield and the development of THORP.  One has only to look at the record of these debates to realise that the same has been said time and time again.  The previous speaker referred to his concerns about THORP. I put a number of questions to Deputy Molloy, when Minister for Energy, and his response was that there was no scope <Col N="1429" /> for action in this matter.  That response is used by successive Ministers for Energy.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have participated in this debate are familiar with letters from the British Embassy containing facts about British nuclear power stations and the proposed radioactive waste storage plant at Sellafield.  I am sure the British authorities will write to a number of Members who participate in this debate, highlighting the British case on Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The developments in this area may be frustrating for the general public who are involved in environmental protection, pollution control and projects such as the healthy cities project in which Dublin city participates.  While these projects operate in the best interests of the general public, we have allowed, since 1978, a £3 billion investment in a plant which, if a simple accident were to occur there, would wipe out all our efforts.  This is a cause of frustration to people who have done trojan work in this area.  They believe that those in authority should initiate the legal process necessary to stop the development at THORP.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one thing I do not have.  We all heard the Minister's comments on this matter.  He was congratulated by all sides of the House on his work to date.  He lodged a formal detailed complaint with the British authorities on behalf of the Irish people in his early days as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Successive Ministers for Energy went down that road, but it did not result in the closure of Sellafield or put an end to the development of the THORP reprocessing plant. The only way to put an end to the activities of the reckless villains, British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the British authorities, is to take legal action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> In terms of nuclear accidents, there is no such thing as national boundaries.  A single nuclear accident can destroy the lives of thousands of people in a wide geographic catchment area.  If there is a similar accident at the THORP plant Ireland will suffer greatly.  I cannot understand why the Attorney General or some legal eagle &mdash; I see Deputy McDowell in the House &mdash; has not put sufficient evidence together to enable the Irish Government to take legal action to stop this plant going ahead.  We have tried every other avenue but have failed.</P>
    <P>I have in my files an article from a newspaper which states that deadly shipments of plutonium to nuclear reactors will pass through the Irish sea.  It goes on to say that both the Japanese and French authorities have kept silent about the routes to be taken by the ship but that it will be accompanied by <i>shikishima</i> which will carry a cannon and machine gun to counter any terrorist attack.  The decision to have these shipments which will travel the Irish sea escorted by warships is a very serious matter.  Deputy Broughan referred to the need for us to improve our facilities to monitor this development.</P>
    <P>For far too long the general public has heard the same rhetoric in the House about this matter &mdash; one has only to look at the debates to realise that Members genuinely sought to address the problems posed by this development &mdash; with no progress being made.  The amendment clearly states that the Government will examine all possible options open to it, including diplomatic &mdash; the best channel &mdash; international pressure and legal action.  In supporting the amendment, I assure the House that this matter is regularly discussed at Fianna Fáil parliamentary meetings and it will not rest until we receive a full and satisfactory response to our concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members who have contributed to the debate on this important matter.  I believe that this House is at one in its opposition to operations <Col N="1431" /> at Sellafield in general and, in particular, to the start-up of THORP.</P>
      <P>In the debate last night a number of points were raised to which I would like to refer.  Deputy Sargent indicated that we were on record as saying that the commissioning of THORP will be in breach of EU law.  I totally reject that attribution.  He referred to three EU directives &mdash; the Basic Safety Standards Directive, the Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment and the Freedom of Environmental Information Directive.  None of these three pieces of European law provides any obvious basis for legal action The EU Commission has satisfied itself, and has clearly stated in a press release, that it has taken all the necessary steps to ensure the conformity of the THORP plant with the Euratom Treaty.  The question of whether an environmental impact assessment prior to start-up is needed is still under consideration by the Commission but, as Minister Cowen explained in some detail last night, there are major problems about establishing any case based on the EIA Directive.</P>
      <P>As to the Freedom of Environmental Information Directive, the Touche Ross report, which was referred to, is a financial document on the economics of THORP and does not deal with environmental matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sargent also stated that British Nuclear Fuels indicated it cannot guarantee to keep discharges within proposed limits.  He also expressed concerns about Krypton-85 gas.  We have asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to expand its programme of testing of levels of radioactive contamination of the marine and aerial environment with a view to detecting any unexpected changes in our environment and to monitor the levels of exposure of the Irish population to radiation arising from the start-up of THORP.  Special equipment has already been installed at the institute's laboratories to monitor atmospheric levels of Krypton-85 gas, the main contributory factor to the increase <Col N="1432" /> in atmospheric discharges resulting from THORP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister welcomes THORP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hypocritical.  It is necessary that any radioactive discharges be kept as low as reasonably achievable, and I assure the House that this issue will be closely monitored in the relevant international fora.  In line with the Oslo and Paris Conventions on the prevention of Marine Pollution in the north-east Atlantic, we will seek to have all radioactive discharges from Sellafield and THORP progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated.</P>
      <P>Deputies Allen and Durkan suggested that the Government's position on this matter amounted to a soft approach and that we should make a strong and vigorous approach through all international bodies.  I reject any suggestion that the Government's opposition to THORP has in any way diminished.  As Minister Cowen outlined last night, we have taken all the action we can and pursued our case with vigour.  Apart from the two submissions, the Government has consistently argued the case against THORP at every opportunity and in every international forum.</P>
      <P>The Government's submission in October 1993 has been widely welcomed and praised by national and international environmental interests and our contributions at the Oslo and Paris Commissions on Radioactive Wastes and the London Dumping Convention have also been favourably commented upon by such organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, it is a grave disappointment that, despite widespread concerns and reservations about THORP, it is now being allowed to open by the UK authorities.  Our opposition to Sellafield, and to the nuclear option in general, will continue.  While the Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield, if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist it will not initiate such action without a firm legal case <Col N="1433" /> based on sufficient evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.  As we already outlined, no such evidence is yet available. Deputy Molloy, a former Minister for Energy, is fully aware of this.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is no evidence to date to suggest that activities at the entire complex, including the proposed operation of the THORP plant, are or will be in breach of EU law and international conventions which would sustain a successful legal action.  The Government remains open to information and evidence from any source to support a sustainable case regarding the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>In tackling these ongoing and long term issues, a combination of political and economic forces offer a more hopeful prospect than legal action unsupported by hard evidence which would convince a court that real material damage and injury will inevitably ensue if operations were to commence.  There are risks but the quantification and proof needed to sustain a case is not there.  Legal action has not succeeded in specific cases brought by the residents of the Sellafield area who are much more at risk to any damaging effects from its operation than the population of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A hasty and ill-conceived legal action could have little or no hope of success in resolving the problem which it seeks to address.  Failure in such a case can confer legitimacy on an operation to which we are opposed that it did not necessarily possess prior to taking such action and it might well prejudice a better founded case at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate that the Government remains committed to maintaining vigorous and sustained diplomatic and international pressure on the British authorities with regard to operations at <Col N="1434" /> the Sellafield complex, including THORP, and will continue to examine all options open to it to achieve the objective of the eventual closure of the plant. I wish to restate strongly that legal action remains a possibility when there is sufficient evidence that there is a clearly identifiable breach of national, European or international law and that the British Government fails to take any action to remedy the breach.  I repeat once again, it is not a sufficient basis for legal action that we do not like or agree with THORP.  We are totally opposed to it and will continue to be.</P>
    <P>I regret Deputy O'Malley is not present in the House but I welcome his conversion to opposition to this plant because 20 years ago he promoted the idea of nuclear energy in the south east.</P>

It is often an opportunity for Members to vent anger on such a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; issue about the British Government.  I do not lay the blame for the imminent commissioning of THORP on the British Government.  I lay the blame on this Government for its failure to take appropriate action to stop THORP coming into operation and for its failure to convince the British Government by diplomatic or other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has produced some <Col N="1435" /> impressive statements and politically correct documents about Sellafield.  It has made submissions but these have been mainly for domestic consumption in an attempt to respond politically to the concerns of the people.  At the same time the Government has been privately signalling to the British Government that it could proceed with THORP and that they recognised the realities of the situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister acts the bully boy in the House and the choir boy when it comes to talking to the British Government about THORP.  This is a case of nod and wink politics, nodding to the people that the Government is opposed to Sellafield while at the same time winking at the British authorities that they could proceed with the commissioning of THORP.  How else can one explain the gulf between ministerial rhetoric and Government inactivity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> The Government has failed the credibility test on this issue.  In 1990, during the so called Green Presidency, the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, signed a document sanctioning EU loans for the building of THORP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have failed to make Sellafield a central issue in Anglo-Irish discussions.  When was this issue last raised by the Taoiseach at an EU summit?  Successive Governments have failed to take legal action to stop the commissioning of THORP, claiming they needed a watertight case before proceeding.  Nobody goes into court with a watertight case.  What type of evidence is the Government waiting for in order to proceed?  How many people must develop cancer?  Are we waiting for people to die from the effects of this plant before the Government proceeds with this case?</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute has evidence of plutonium in seaweed in the Irish Sea.  There is also evidence of plutonium in fish.  Where would that have come from?  The evidence is there but the Government does not have the will to proceed with it.</P>
      <P>Apart from the environmental case against THORP, an economic case has emerged for the abandonment of the project. Because THORP will produce a product that is no longer in demand, the British cabinet had to consider abandoning it, but apparently the likely political embarrassment of abandoning the project was the main reason they decided to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Irish Government had initiated a legal case or even threatened legal action while the British Government was considering abandoning THORP, it might have made a completely different decision.  For several critical months the decision on the THORP project was tottering and because this Government had not made a sufficiently strong case and <Col N="1437" /> did not have the bottle to take a legal case against it, THORP is proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for allowing me some time and compliment him for moving this important motion.  The THORP plant represents the greatest environmental threat to the east coast and to Dublin in particular. I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the Minister is citing his legal advice that there is no sustainable case simply as an excuse for inaction.  The Government is afraid to embarrass the British on this issue; it does not have the courage to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a remark at the time of the Downing Street Declaration that it was better to try and fail than to do nothing.  This is a clear example of a <Col N="1438" /> parallel situation.  The threat is so serious that it is best for the Government to bring this case before the European Court of Justice and to take whatever legal action is open to it.  If that results in failure at least it will have made some effort.  To do nothing about the bigest potential threat to this city and a huge section of the population is a scandal.</P>
    <P>As a representative of this House on the Council of Europe, I attended a meeting yesterday of the environment committee in the Palais due Luxembourg in Paris.  At that meeting we discussed Energy Europe 2,000, a plan for environment minded energy policy.  Because of the seriousness of the threat posed by THORP I availed of the opportunity to raise the fears which I said were felt by the Irish Government &mdash; I wonder now should I have mentioned the Government. I also raised the fears of the people of this country, those of the people of Dublin in particular.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the support I received from European parliamentarians, particularly those from the Netherlands.  A Mr. Esma came out very strongly demanding that the committee take heed of what I was saying and that, as part of that report, the council of Europe should examine the implications of THORP for Ireland and for the environment here.  He made the point that there are member states on the Council of Europe who have contracts with THORP, principally Germany, without which contracts the overall development there would be uneconomic.  He said that for that reason alone the Council of Europe should take a stand on this issue. I accept that was a small stand for me to take but if the Irish Government followed with genuine efforts to highlight the potential threat that Sellafield/THORP pose to this country, it would be supported by the vast majority of our people. Its inaction will be condemned by the vast majority of our people.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine agus na Teachtaí go léir ar gach thaobh den <Col N="1439" /> Teach a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo ar son an rúin agus ina choinne.</P>
      <P>I bet that British Nuclear Fuels are laughing this evening at the Government amendment because it serves to scatter completely the focus of what was intended by my tabling my motion.  It is about realism.  Indeed, the Minister had the gall to begin his contribution by talking about realism, a word I picked out of his lengthy contribution and on which we need to dwell since it was with realism that I embarked on my motion.</P>
      <P>I want Sellafield closed as much as does the Minister but I am not going to table a motion saying let us close Sellafield when the legal case against us is fraught with difficulty, as the Minister well knows, when the Merlin and other cases taken have been very strong going into court but have fallen apart because of the ambiguity and difficulty of being 100 per cent certain about health factors.</P>
      <P>I am talking about THORP, about a plant that has not yet come into operation. I want to ensure that we dwell on that issue.  All the other factors spoken of have distracted people from the real issue.  I am sufficiently realistic, for instance, not to call that nuclear law be brought into line with that in the food industry which has to prove that any new development or additive is safe for human consumption.  The nuclear industry assures us that it is all right; it does not have to prove its case by subjecting people to any of those poisons.  In addition, I am more realistic than the Minister for Health who tabled a similar type motion and wanted Sellafield closed. I wonder how he will vote this evening.  I am being more specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about not specifying a basis.  It has been perceived by legal people that the basis is contained in the Minister's submission and can be developed.  European law is there to protect us and ought be invoked.  I will not go into all the legal aspects about which I spoke last evening because time does not permit me.  Nonetheless it is important that the Minister implement those <Col N="1440" /> directives, the EIA one especially warranting comment.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has spoken to Greenpeace before and hope he will again.  Greenpeace on the proposed THORP plant said:</P>
    <P>It is most definitely in breach of EU Directives and the Government should follow this line and take an immediate action in the European Court.</P>
    <P>Greenpeace concluded:</P>
    <P>The EIA Directive is being disregarded in a number of ways by the United Kingdom.  It is not enough for Ireland to simply request an EIA.  It is now time for legal action to protect and safeguard Irish health and environment.</P>
    <P>It is time to look beyond the cosy confines of Cabinet to ascertain what possibilities lie out there.  The Minister must be somewhat more aggressive, something with which he is at home in political terms. We must be legally quite aggressive and there is no better man than the Minister with his legal background.</P>
    <P>We should continue to examine all the options available to us.  There are, for example, the supply countries, the facts mentioned last evening, that many of them do not have high level waste stores at present.  Goodness knows what they will do when Greenpeace says they will have to take back their waste.  We will be faced with that in the future and that may leave open another option for us.</P>
    <P>Next Monday is the deadline, THORP is the issue and, if we do not act on it, next Monday will be too late.  The Government should take action quickly because if it does not others will.  The Government should bear in mind that it should not depend on the likes of Greenpeace to take a case in the United Kingdom, or even to take a case from here; it should not depend on Friends of the Earth International, which is at present preparing a case for the European Court on this issue.  In addition it should not be necessary for our local authorities to leap frog over the Government on an international issue of this type <Col N="1441" /> and magnitude.  For example, I know that the General Council of County Councils a couple of days ago suspended their standing orders to pass a motion, such was the urgency of THORP, and THORP is the issue.</P>
    <P>Are we leaving it up to volunteers? Are we leaving it to local authorities? Those questions must be answered.  The Minister talks about not wanting to lose. Where would that attitude get us in other circles?  For example, were the Minister offered the job of manager of the Irish soccer team, would he be afraid to go out on the pitch for fear of losing?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not feel somewhat ashamed that groups with very scarce resources &mdash; groups that will never get Structural Funds and so on &mdash; are putting all of their available resources at risk along with the threat of the costs which the British High Court, the European Court, or any other court can throw at them?  That shame must be borne in mind when we take a decision on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal, for what it is worth, to those members of the Cabinet who at least were, if they do not remain, members <Col N="1442" /> of CND &mdash; the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins and the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin &mdash; to come out of hiding from behind the skirts of Government diplomacy. There is no point in saying they are voting for the Government amendment because they love Labour more than they love the health and welfare of the Irish people or that they love Fianna Fáil or the possibility of going into court. We have to be and show how serious we are about the issue.  The British Government will not respect us one iota for saying we are being very careful; we will just keep talking it out.  I am afraid they will not talk out this problem.  I appeal to all Deputies, particularly those on the Government side representing the east coast, who have stood on various platforms stating that had they the chance they would take a legal case.  This is a specific issue, not about health factors or proving that somebody contracted cancer because of the location of Sellafield.  It is about European Union law which is being breached and we must dwell on that.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to focus attention on his amendment in so far as it applies to THORP.  Government Deputies representing the east coast should consider what they are doing by voting for the amendment which scatters the focus of what I endeavoured to achieve in my motion.  I ask them to consider voting for it.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Proposed Closure of Kilkenny Company.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise the matter of the proposed closure of Universal Cladding, Kilkenny, which will directly affect the 30 people employed there.  This company is probably the first in the series of creditors of Mahon McPhillips that has gone into arrears and liquidation.  It is a sad day for this company as it is for the closure of any company.  This company has been involved for some time in industrial <Col N="1445" /> roofing contracts, it has strong links with the UK where it has carried out extensive work and developed a good reputation in the business.</P>
      <P>A creditors' meeting has been called for Friday next at which co-operation will be required by creditors regarding outstanding liabilities.  It is remarkable that Allied Irish Banks is the financial institution involved as approximately £200,000 is owed by Mahon McPhillips to the company.  I would have thought the financial institution involved in the Kentz Corporation and with Universal Cladding would have acted less swiftly in this instance and would have co-operated with the company to see if it could trade itself out of difficulties, particularly as the Kentz Corporation is under examinership.</P>
      <P>A matter that caused grave concern to the company and contributed enormously to the fact that it has gone into liquidation is the high cost of insurance. The managing director informed me today that he received a quotation of £78,000 for employers' liability and public liability insurance on a turnover of £1.5 million.  A quotation for similar business in the UK would be £8,000 which gives an indication of the extent of the uncompetitiveness of this company when it has to compete with UK companies in Dublin for very important contracts. Apart from the bad debts incurred by the company and the difficulties with the financial institutions other matters have led to the downfall of this company, namely, insurance.  I appeal to the Minister to exhort the IDA and his Department to ensure that this company is investigated as soon as possible with a view to saving jobs and contracts.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I ask the Minister of State to come to the rescue of this company and save jobs. Money will be spent travelling throughout the world and advertising Ireland as a place to which to bring industry.  Setting up new jobs would cost far more.  This successful company is the victim of circumstances outside its control.  Mahon McPhilips may be a victim also but the <Col N="1446" /> difficulties in the Kentz Corporation is having a ripple effect.  I ask the Minister to use the IDA and to negotiate with the banks with a view to keeping this company in operation and to maintain employment where it exists.  I could repeat much of what has been said by my colleague but there is no need.  I look forward to a positive reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Universal Cladding Systems Limited is an industrial roofing contracting company which was established in 1985.  The company has not received grant assistance or had direct contact with my Department or the State agencies under its aegis.  Notwithstanding that I am conscious of the importance of the employment afforded by this company and the consequences of any job losses to the local economy.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern about this company whose problems I understand are linked to difficulties at the Kentz Corporation at present in examinership.  The final report of the examiner appointed by the High Court on the future viability of the Kentz group is awaited.  Deputies will appreciate that payments to Kentz suppliers and subcontractors, such as Universal Cladding are a matter for the examiner and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, Universal Cladding is one of a group of three companies, the other being QEF Limited and Universal MSP and I am assured that the problems at Universal Cladding will not have any adverse effect on the other two companies in the group.</P>
      <P>I understand the point about insurance made by Deputy Hogan and I propose to bring forward reforms in that area.  I agree with the Deputy about those statistics. They are unacceptable and I know the Deputy and his party will consider my proposals to tackle them, when I bring them forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday the Minster for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, announced a major new industry for <Col N="1447" /> Kilkenny, namely HIS Incorporated of New York, to establish a quality jeans manufacturing facility which will create 460 new jobs over the next two years. While this announcement will not directly impact on the company we are discussing here, it reflects ongoing commitment to job creation in the region.  I have no doubt that the obvious attractions of Kilkenny will succeed in bringing further investment to that region in the future and I will certainly spare no effort to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter which concerns the appalling housing situation in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county.  At this stage it is the worst housing crisis in the country.  There is a serious national housing crisis and approximately 30,000 housing applicants on local authority housing waiting lists.  The Minister has announced 3,500 house starts for 1994 which, with surrenders, will result in 7,000 new lettings this year.  The problem, however, is that the number on the waiting lists is rising faster than house provision.  For example, when the Minister announced his plan for social housing in 1991 there were 23,000 on the waiting lists, now the figure is almost 30,000. Indeed, the Minister's promise of 7,000 new lettings this year is considerably less than the 10,000 new lettings which the plan for social housing was supposed to produce.</P>
      <P>The Government's answer to the housing crisis, the plan for social housing, is simply not working and needs to be drastically overhauled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown the situation is even worse than the national picture, it has the worst housing problem in the country.  There are over 1,300 applicants on its housing waiting list, the largest number on any county council housing list.  There are approximately 700 awaiting transfer from sub-standard <Col N="1448" /> accommodation or from flats which need refurbishment.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council has over 500 dwellings without a bathroom, and over 200 without an indoor toilet.  In the private rented sector, rents are perhaps the highest in the country while many privately rented dwellings are virtually uninhabitable.</P>
    <P>House prices in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown are the highest in the country, forcing even more people on housing waiting lists and making it difficult to use the shared ownership scheme as a means of reducing them.  The price of starter houses for first time buyers is between £55,000 and £60,000.  Houses in local authority estates are currently selling at between £40,000 and £50,000.</P>
    <P>This combination of long waiting list, sub-standard housing stock and high private house prices makes Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown's problem unique. However, the special circumstances of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown have not been recognised by the Minister.  The allocation for 1994 is 125 house starts &mdash; for a combined applicant and transfer list of approximately 2,000.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance stated that an extra £15 million was being made available for local authority housing.  What has become of this money?  The National Housing Allocation for 1994 is 3,500 &mdash; the same as 1993.  Where is the extra money?</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to make an extra allocation to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The housing situation in the new county is critical.  Families who are waiting for housing are becoming desperate. Today I heard from a family who in desperation has decided to squat in a vacant house; from a young mother who is homeless and who has a child suffering from spina bifida; from a mother who has four teenage girls in a house with no bathroom; from a couple who are sharing a bedroom with two children, one of whom is 13 years old and from an elderly couple who have been served with notice of eviction and who are terrified at the prospect of homelessness.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make additional funds available to help relieve <Col N="1449" /> the hidden misery of the thousands stuck on housing waiting lists and to increase the allocation of 125 house starts which he has made available to Dún Laoghaire this year but which is inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this important matter.  I recognise his sincerity and acknowledge his positive record in social housing and his efforts on behalf of his constituency and county.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to tackle social housing needs by speeding up the implementation of the plan for social housing and by expanding the local authority housing programme, thereby recognising the seriousness of the problem.</P>
      <P>The 1993 expenditure of £105 million on the local authority and social housing programmes represented an increase of 37 per cent on the 1992 figure.  The 1994 estimates provided for a further increase of over 70 per cent on the 1993 outturn to £179 million.  A total of 3,800 local authority housing starts or acquisitions were achieved in 1993 compared to 1,314 in 1992.  Provision is made for the commencement of 3,500 local authority houses in 1994 and the extra money announced in the budget was required to achieve that number of new starts in 1994.  The housing needs of some 18,000 families will not be met between 1994 and 1995 through the local authority programme, the social housing schemes and vacancies in the local authority stock.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to maintaining the local authority programme at a level appropriate to the extent of continuing housing needs.  In addition, the voluntary housing sector provided some 900 units of accommodation during 1993 and activity in this sector will continue to be encouraged and expanded.  The 1994 capital provision for the voluntary housing schemes has been increased to £33 million or 65 per cent more than 1993 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new house programmes for 1994 notified to the individual housing authorities <Col N="1450" /> on 10 February 1994 were determined having regard to the competing needs of the authorities and the overall programme of 3,500 new house start or acquisitions sanctioned for 1994.</P>
    <P>I have notified Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that they can start or acquire 125 houses in 1994.  This is an increase of 15 houses on the 1993 authorised level of 110 houses.  The council's programme of 125 houses is the largest of the three new county councils this year.  In 1993, 130 houses were started in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  These included 20 which were not started during 1992;67 houses were completed or acquired during the year and a further 127 were under construction at the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>The availability of local authority accommodation for renting to persons on the waiting list does not depend solely on the number of new units of accommodation provided annually.  It is worth noting that during 1993 there were 93 lettings to housing applicants as a result of casual vacancies arising in the authority's existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the local authority housing programme the house building element should not be taken in isolation. Cognisance must be taken of the funds being made available for the remedial works scheme and the other measures under the plan for social housing.</P>
    <P>Under the remedial works scheme, the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council has been allocated over £2.4 million for a number of projects including completed schemes at St. Patrick's Square, St. Patrick's Road and Avenue, Pinewood and Willow Vale and Brookfield Place and ongoing schemes at Cross Avenue-Dominick Street and Glasthule Buildings. As a result the standard of the dwellings concerned has been immeasurably improved and units of accommodation that would otherwise be lost to the housing stock now provide high class accommodation for families in need.</P>
    <P>The council has received some £330,000 under the sub-programmes to provide bathrooms in local authority dwellings without these basic facilities. <Col N="1451" /> There is additional funding available under that heading this year.  The voluntary housing scheme is now making an increased contribution to social housing. Last year six units were provided under this scheme in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area and a further 31 units were commenced, including a sizeable scheme for elderly persons in Dalkey.  An application for a £154,000 grant for a new project of seven units in Blackrock is under consideration.  I expect to be in a position to give a positive response to that application in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There was a major expansion under the share ownership scheme in the area in 1993 with 1,100 transactions completed nationally compared with 558 in 1992.  A capital provision of £35 million was made available in 1993 to facilitate local authority activity in this area.  This provision has been increased to £40 million in the current year.  There was substantial activity under this scheme in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in 1993 which enabled 43 transactions to be completed. In total, 210 families were housed in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in 1993.  I estimate that a further 305 families will have new homes before the end of this year.  That accounts for half the number on the official waiting lists, from latest figures I have from the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing with the Deputy but the county council gave me those figures.  In the past two years roughly half of those on the waiting list have been housed and in a four year period I would hope to have the housing list down to manageable proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the level of housing construction notified by the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council for 1994 <Col N="1452" /> when taken with the provision of the various initiatives in the plan for social housing and casual vacancies arising in existing housing stock.  This represents a reasonable and acceptable response to the social housing needs of the area. Again this year the &ldquo;build or lose&rdquo; rule applies, which means that if the local authority does not build houses it will not get the money, which will be transferred elsewhere.  On foot of the case made by the Deputy, I will certainly look at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown for a further allocation should any authority not meet its allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this very important issue. The regulations governing the movement of animals from restricted herds or a restricted area are very very severe.  I fully support that.  A farmer found in breach of such rules would face the wrath of a district justice and would have to face a jail penalty.  We have spent millions since the mid-fifties trying to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis.  The cost to the State has been enormous but the cost to individual farmers whose herds have been stricken with disease is devastating.  The compensation is not adequate, given the enormous increase in the value of dairy herds.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because it has come to my notice that animals were moved from a farm in Donegal without a proper permit.  I understand that 101 cattle were taken from a restricted herd.  The sheriff having failed to get the cattle for which he had a permit, took 101 other cattle to a destination in Ballinasloe, where they were not received when they arrived.  The officials who issued the permit were at fault for not ensuring that before the cattle were moved from Donegal there was a home for them in Galway.  The cattle had to remain in the lorries before proceeding after some considerable time to Navan, County Meath.  Again there was no home for the cattle and no permit was yet in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> After much controversy people objected to Friesian cattle in calf being slaughtered&mdash;phone calls were made to mysterious people who unfortunately must remain nameless and an offer was made by certain people that if the cattle were slaughtered, moneys would pass hands.  The cattle were then moved to Ballinagh, County Cavan.  The original owners and others who had taken up the case followed the lorries and thankfully the cattle were saved, following a phone call to the county registrar, Mr. Tommy Owens, at 2 a.m.  He has a proper compound for receiving animals but at maximum it holds only 50 animals.  When told of the distressed state of the cattle, who had been in the lorries for 24 hours he finally agreed under protest to have the animals brought to the compound. He was forced into that situation.  I am happy to report that all the animals have made a full recovery having been exceptionally looked after due to the diligence of this man and his staff.  They remain there without a permit.</P>
    <P>Farmers in County Cavan are having enormous problems trying to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis.  I am not suggesting that the disease problems emanate from this compound in Crossdony but farmers fear that cattle travelling to the compound, especially from restricted herds, are a danger.  The disposal of the dung puts animals at risk.</P>
    <P>Departmental officials, officials of the sheriff's office in County Donegal and the bankers acted without due regard for the welfare of the animals and the farmers' lands through which they passed on their journey from Donegal to Ballinasloe, Navan and Ballinagh without a proper permit.  If a farmer had done that he would be behind bars.  The proper procedures were not in place and somebody was negligent.  Family farms were put in danger by this irresponsible act and I hope it will never be repeated.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tommy Owens, Cavan County Registrar, acted in the best interests of the animals in a situation over which he had no control and I compliment him and his staff on the manner in which they recovered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for tabling this question.  I am surprised he did not identify the specific case.  Had he done so, I would have been pleased to respond to the well founded charges he made.  He has placed me at a serious disadvantage. His question refers to the need to ensure that diseased cattle are not moved without a permit and there is no reference whatsoever to the detailed case which he outlined.  I regret that I am not in a position to respond to specific points.</P>
      <P>Under the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, restriction control measures are put into effect following the disclosure of reactor animals in a herd as a result of a test.  The holding on which the reactor herd is located is restricted on foot of a restriction notice issued by a veterinary inspector.  Animals cannot be moved or traded into or out of the herd during the period of restriction.  Following the application of the appropriate testing regime to the herd, to ensure that all the animals in the herd then test clear, the herd is derestricted on the basis of a formal herd derestriction notice.</P>
      <P>The movement of all reactor animals is subject to the issue of a movement permit by officials of my Department. Following the disclosure of reactor animals, a movement permit is given to the herdowner to enable the removal of the reactor animals to a registered meat export plant.  Reactor animals are specially ear punched and a visible additonal tag is applied so that the animals are clearly identifiable as reactors to minimise the risk of mixing with clear animals.</P>
      <P>Under certain and specific conditions a herdowner whose herd remains restricted may be facilitated to purchase replacement stock on the basis of permission being given by a veterinary inspector. Also, animals which are not reactors may be moved on foot of a permit to slaughter at a meat plant or to another secure holding which then falls under the restriction control applicable in respect of the holding from which the animals were moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The permitting of animals under the <Col N="1455" /> animal health regulations is strictly enforced and herdowners are obliged to comply as a condition for the securring of payment of the appropriate reactor grants with other grants, including depopulation grants and income supplement. The movement of any animal into or out of a restricted herd without the permission of a veterinary inspector at the district veterinary office would be viewed in a most serious light.  Any such movement would, of course, be illegal and could give rise to prosecution under the bovine TB and brucellosis orders.</P>
    <P>Given the very substantial cost of the eradication programmes in terms of the contribution by farmers and the Exchequer, movement control of diseased animals by means of a movement permit is accepted as a fundamental requirement in the control and limitation of the spread of disease.  Because of the very obvious risk to clear herds and, in consequence, to their livelihoods, herdowners accept the inconvenience and need for strict movement control and to have a creditable compliance reputation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Currently my Department is developing a computerised animal movement permit project which will enhance the precision and effectiveness of the present permit arrangement and which is designed to expedite the processing and payment of headage premia.  The system will facilitate rapid track-back to sources of disease and will be a powerful new resource to assist the reduction of the low but chronic incidence of bovine TB in particular.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the country's overall animal health status, the bovine TB scheme has to be looked at in the context of the low national incidence of the disease. Over 99 per cent of the 7 million animals in the national herd are clear, while in herd terms, over 97 per cent of the country's 169,000 herds are free of the disease.  There are difficulties associated with reducing this residual level of infection. It is now accepted, following, the ERAD 1988-92 experience, that, in addition to testing, emphasis must be <Col N="1456" /> placed on bringing new technology and new strategies to the scheme.  In this regard considerable resources are being devoted to the development of new tools to assist the testing strategy, namely the development of a blood based diagnostic test, the building of a computerised movement permit system and research into the development of a vaccine for wildlife and cattle.  Obtaining EU funding would create extra resources to broaden the format of the programme and I am continuing to press for an increase in the veterinary fund which would allow for a draw-down of such funding.</P>
    <P>The question of expenditure under the disease eradication schemes must be related to the very considerable benefits to the Exchequer generated from the value of meat and milk exports in excess of £2 billion per annum, and to the considerable level of employment created in the agri-business involved.  If we had not reduced bovine TB levels from the 20 per cent or so incidence of the 1960s to the present low level then both the European and third country markets could well have been closed to Irish agriculture with disastrous results for the national economy.  EU legislation requires that at least one full round of testing of the national herd be undertaken to preserve the country's officially TB free status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent report of the expert advisory group reviewing the third level grants scheme serves once again to highlight the anomalies and inequities in the assessment of farm incomes for the purposes of the scheme.  These experts are proposing that the value of assets such as land should be taken into account in determining eligibility for such grants. We do not know how far they intend to go with this proposal or the other sectors where the value of assets might be taken into account.  The Minister appeared to indicate earlier today that we will not find out because she refused to publish the report.  This is a disquieting prospect because the proposal that the value of <Col N="1457" /> assets should be taken into account in determining eligibility for these meanstested grants is nonsense and can only cause further inequities.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows as well as I do that the asset value of farm land is not income.  In today's circumstances 50 acres of reasonable land could easily have an asset value of £150,000 or more.  In a typical case, family income, if the farm is doing well, might be in the region of £10,000-£12,000.  The asset value and income are disproportionate.  In many cases, there are borrowings for productive purposes and land purchases with the land being used as security.  In those cases, the effective asset value to the farmer is a great deal lower than the book value.</P>
      <P>Will these experts propose that the assets used by other people should be taken into account?  Will they propose that the assets used by industrial workers, by those involved in the financial sector such as bank managers, clerks or insurance companies, should be taken into account and, if not, what is the reason they have proposed that the value of assets owned by farmers should be taken into account?</P>
      <P>This proposal has much more to do with the ideology of socialist begrudgery than with any concern for equity in expenditure.  I am astonished that we have heard nothing from Fianna Fáil on this issue.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil entered Government with the Labour Party to support this socialist begrudgery which has become a common feature of Government policy.  When asked specifically about this report in the House earlier today, the Minister refused to publish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are inequities in the existing scheme.  When a farmer applies for a higher education grant for a member of the family and produces a statement of income which is accepted by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes further adjustments have to be made.  In every case these are to the disadvantage of the son or daughter seeking a grant to attend a third level institution.  For example, payments made for leased machinery and <Col N="1458" /> capital allowances are added and credited as farm income for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>It ignores the fact that to stay in business farmers must invest, that it is not discretionary and if a tractor is worn out it has to be replaced.  However, if the farmer leases the tractor, the lease payment is added to his income and if he borrows money and pays interest on the loan the interest payment is added to his income and he will probably be disqualified from getting a grant.</P>
    <P>Compensation for the temporary suspension of milk quota is treated as income for higher education grant purposes where it is treated as capital for income tax purposes, but everybody knows that compensation payments for the cessation of milk production are usually used to set up another enterprise on the farm.  Farmers are not entitled to PAYE allowance and there is no allowance for the self-employed PRSI payments they make.</P>
    <P>These and other factors mean that effective income thresholds are higher for farmers than for any other profession. To give an example, a married farmer with two children and a taxable income of £15,000 will not qualify for a grant under the scheme at the moment whereas, a married person in any other walk of life with the same taxable income will rightly and properly qualify for a grant.  Does the Minister of State have proposals to end these inequities and particularly to deflect this latest piece of begrudging socialist nonsense that is about to be foisted on us?</P>

      <P>I am happy to respond to the Deputy on this matter.</P>
      <P>It affords me an opportunity to clarify the position and to reiterate the continuing commitment of the Minister for Education to facilitate wider access for all students to third level education and the continued improvement and reform of the third level student support schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third level area, well over half of the total enrolment of 80,000 students <Col N="1459" /> in the 1992-93 academic year were in receipt of student support, in the form of higher education grants, vocational scholarships and ESF grants, compared with a quarter of all students in 1982-83. It is, therefore, essential that the moneys on third level student aid expended by the Exchequer are equally and fairly distributed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed within the constraints of Exchequer resources to the elimination of inequities and anomalies from the third level student support schemes.  In March 1993 the Minister established an expert advisory group on third level student support with the following terms of reference: (a) to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay and (b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective organisational arrangements for the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>That group worked closely with, and drew on, the expertise of Departmental officials and received submissions from all interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister received the group's report recently and obtained the agreement of Government for a number of major improvements to improve the administration of the third level student support schemes.  As a result the Government has agreed already to implement the following improvements: the establishment of a central agency to process grant applications and payments, and thereby dramatically improve the service to the student; this will take effect for the 1995-96 academic year; the abolition of the separate attainments for eligibility for a grant; this will ensure that all students who have secured a college place will now qualify for a grant subject to meeting <Col N="1460" /> the means test; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases&mdash;this is to ensure students who did not complete their initial studies will be eligible to apply for grants for second chance courses after five years; the provision of a discretionary budget in 1994 to set up a hardship fund with third level institutions; an increase in the income limits in line with the average industrial wage and in maintenance grants in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>The group would have looked at a wide range of additional issues involved in the determination of reckonable income for grant purposes including anomalies in the assessment of farm income to determine eligibility for higher education grants.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing its study of the other significant findings in the report.  When the study is completed the Minister will publish the report and put forward a range of additional measures designed to: (i) address the concerns to which the Deputy alluded; (ii) ensure greater equity in the operation of the schemes; and (iii) continue the task of improving access to third level education.  I agree with Deputy Dukes.  I come from a rural constitutuency and represent many small farmers.  Perhaps Deputy Dukes, on the other hand, represents many large farmers.</P>

      <P>Ireland attaches particular importance to the development of close relations between Central European countries and the European Union.  The Government are working actively with our European Union partners to assist these countries in the ongoing transformation to democratic institutions and market economies and in their efforts to ensure the protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>The Dublin European Council, in April 1990, elaborated the concept of wide-ranging Association Agreements for Central and Eastern European countries to provide for phased movement towards free trade in goods and services, for continuing economic assistance and for regular political dialogue in an institutional framework.  To date, Association Agreements have been concluded with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania and Bulgaria.  Ireland was the first EU country to ratify the Agreements with Poland and Hungary which came into force on 1 February last.</P>
      <P>In June 1993, the Copenhagen European Council agreed that the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the EU as soon as they are able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the political and economic conditions required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> To assist them in their efforts to meet these conditions Ireland has strongly advocated the development by the EU of a leading role in the provision of aid to the reform process in Central and Eastern Europe.  The EU has contributed over 61 per cent of aid to date.  The EU has also assumed responsibility for co-ordination of the international aid effort by the G24. EU assistance includes over 2.7 billion ECU granted as project aid under the PHARE programme from 1991-1993.  In addition, major balance of payments loans have been made available to the reforming countries and projects have been rendered eligible for EIB loans.  The EU is also one of the chief participants in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</P>
    <P>Regular political dialogue on international issues of mutual concern takes place on the basis of the structured relationship between the EU and the Central European countries which was agreed upon by the Copenhagen European Council in June, 1993.  Ireland, with its EU partners, is now working to develop the arrangements further, towards an informal association of the Central European countries with the Common Foreign and Security Policy pillar of the Maastricht Treaty.  I am confident that a substantive package in this regard will be agreed by European Union Foreign Ministers shortly.</P>
    <P>The Union has also taken an important initiative to enhance security and stability in Central and Eastern Europe.  The European Council in December last, as one of its first Joint Actions under the CFSP provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, launched the European Stability Pact.  The aim of the Pact is to encourage the States in that region to reach bilateral agreements among themselves on issues concerning frontiers and minorities.  The inaugural Conference is scheduled to take place in Paris on 26-27 May 1994. The concepts which underline the Stability Pack are those of preventative diplomacy, conflict prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes&mdash;concepts that are at the core of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe&mdash;<Col N="1305" /> the CSCE.  Ireland and our partners in the Union work closely with the Central and Eastern European countries in this forum.  The CSCE addresses the security needs of these countries in the broadest sense, with activities encompassing economic matters, human rights, democracy, as well as arms control and reduction, and confidence and security building measures.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Taoiseach visited Mexico in January of this year.  In the course of his visit the Taoiseach met with President Salinas and raised the question of the Chiapas uprising during the course of their discussions.</P>
      <P>President Salinas outlined the action he had taken to resolve the conflict that had arisen in Chiapas.  The Taoiseach sympathised with the Government and the people of Mexico on the loss of life on both sides which this situation had caused and expressed concern to learn how the underlying problems might be dealt with.  He expressed the hope that a negotiated and peaceful resolution could be found.</P>
      <P>Peace talks between envoys of the Mexican Government and the Zapatista National Liberation Army began on 21 February and appear to be making progress.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position on the question of the protection of human rights is well known to the Mexican authorities.  We expect that all allegations of human rights offences will be thoroughly investigated by the Mexican authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 32, 40, 41, 61, 67, 69, 72 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>At the Security Council on 15 February our Permanent Representative, speaking on behalf of the Government advocated that the international community should now intensify efforts to achieve three essential aims:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to maintain and develop the search for a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia on the basis of the European Union's peace plan</P>
      <P>&mdash;to prevent the spread of the conflict,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to ensure the supply and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is fully engaged with our European Union partners in promoting these objectives.  We participate in the International Conference on former Yugoslavia; we support the maximum engagement by the international community in the collective effort for peace; we contribute to UNPROFOR and the EU's Monitor Mission; we are applying sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and we contribute personnel to the CSCE Missions which are helping countries in <Col N="1308" /> the region to implement sanctions.  We have contributed over IR£1.7 million to the international relief effort; medical care is being provided to the victims of the conflict, including to a number of those injured in the 5 February massacre in Sarajevo; we fully support the International Tribunal, established last year by the Security Council, to prosecute those who have perpetuated war crimes and we are contributing £15,000 to the Tribunal, as a further demonstration of the importance which we attach to this work.</P>
    <P>In the statement to the Security Council, to which I have referred, Ireland also called on all parties to respect the UN ceasefire for Sarajevo and to comply fully with the demand for the withdrawal or regrouping of heavy weapons by 20 February. I am pleased that this objective was achieved without the use of force. The humanitarian aid operation is continuing. Sarajevo, though still besieged, is no longer subject to ruthless bombardment.</P>
    <P>An important factor in making this limited but vital progress on Sarajevo was Russia's willingness to redeploy troops expeditiously from Croatia to the UNPROFOR command at Sarajevo.  I welcome this.  I also welcome the active role which the US is playing in the search for peace in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved at Sarajevo must be built upon.  Senior officials of the member states of the European Union met with their Russian, American and Canadian counterparts and with a representative of the United Nations in Bonn on 22 February to coordinate their efforts.  They fully supported the work of the co-chairman David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg and confirmed that the International conference on former Yugoslavia continues to provide the framework for a comprehensive solution for the region.</P>
    <P>A number of short term measures were agreed at the Bonn meeting.  These include the stabilisation of the situation in Sarajevo, the lifting of the siege, and the restoration of normal life, including public services; the rapid completion of <Col N="1309" /> the UNPROFOR troop rotation in Srebrenica and Zepa; the reopening of Tuzla Airport for humanitarian aid deliveries; an effective cease fire in Mostar; and free access for humanitarian aid deliveries to Maglaj.</P>
    <P>The normalisation of relations between the Bosnian Government, the Bosnian Croats and the Croatian Government was identified at the Bonn meeting as a key objective.  While there have been some violations, the ceasefire between the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats, which took effect on 25 February, appears to be generally holding. I am pleased that, early this morning, agreement was reached between the parties on a federal arrangement within Bosnia, with the prospect of a confederal relationship with Croatia.</P>
    <P>I also welcome that progress is being made on the reopening of Tuzla airport. The Bosnian Serbs have now agreed that it can be reopened for humanitarian aid flights.</P>
    <P>The use of air power is provided for in Resolutions of the UN Security Council on Bosnia.  Authority for approving the use of air power rests with the Secretary General, including the approval of air strikes in response to attacks on towns designated as safe areas by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>In its Resolutions 781 and 816 the Security Council banned military flights in Bosnian airspace and authorised UN member states, acting nationally or through regional organisations, to ensure compliance with the ban.  The action taken on 28 February against aircraft violating the &ldquo;no fly&rdquo; zone was under the authority of the Security Council in conformity with these Resolutions.</P>
    <P>The activities of the parties on the ground in recent months would suggest that it is well not to be excessively optimistic about the prospects for an early settlement.  But I believe that there is a new determination by the international community to build upon what has been achieved in Sarajevo last month, to make progress on the other short term goals, and to work for an overall settlement for Bosnia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> We, with our European Union partners, are fully engaged in this process. But a comprehensive and durable peace will be achieved only when all parties commit themselves to a determined effort to arrive at an agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 45, 66 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>Accession negotiations opened in February 1993 with Sweden, Finland and Austria and with Norway two months later.</P>
      <P>The special meeting of the European Council in October set the beginning of March as the target date for concluding these negotiations.  This is to facilitate a timetable under which the ratification process both in the applicant countries and in the current member states can be completed in time for accession to take place on 1 January 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the negotiations over recent months. <Col N="1311" /> As Deputies will be aware, together with Minister of State Tom Kitt I attended negotiating sessions with each of the applicant countries on 21 and 22 February and again last week-end from 25 February to late yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>While the process will continue in the coming days, the Council agreed that in substance the negotiations with Austria, Sweden and Finland are complete.  A number of issues which are still open in the negotiations with Norway will be taken up again on 8 March.</P>
    <P>A wide range of issues has been involved in these negotiations.  Some issues are common to all the applicants, although with variations in each case. In this category fall our discussions on regional policy, adaptation to the Common Agricultural Policy, and contributions to the Union Budget.  Other issues are of particular interest to one or other of the applicants.  For example, Norway has special concerns over fisheries and Austria over road transit.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been concluded substantially with three of the candidate countries and significant progress has been made with a fourth candidate.  In my assessment, we have every reason to hope that the process of consulting the European Parliament and signing and ratifying the agreement can begin next week.  This will involve referendums in the applicant countries later this year.</P>
    <P>A successful conclusion has been the goal towards which the Irish delegation has worked consistently from the outset of the negotiations.  We have paid close attention to the implications for Ireland of the European Union's negotiating position in each of the many areas involved, but while doing this, and ensuring that our particular interests are protected, we have also worked hard for an overall agreement.  Accession to the European Union by Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway will be in our national interest, in the interest of the European Union as a whole, to which we remain firmly committed, and &mdash; in my personal opinion &mdash; in the interest of the applicant countries themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> On the final completion of the negotiations, after assent by the European Parliament and signature by the member states I will be bringing legislation before the Oireachtas to amend the European Communities Act.  At the same time I will submit to the Dáil for consideration a Resolution approving the Accession Treaty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan's question suggests a perspective broader than the current round of enlargement negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 agreed that associated countries in central and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union once they are able to satisfy the necessary economic and political requirements.  The European Council underlined that the Union's own capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is another important consideration.</P>
    <P>Turkey, Malta and Cyprus have also applied for membership of the European Union.  The General Affairs Council last October mandated the Commission to undertake specific new forms of consultation with both Malta and Cyprus.</P>
    <P>On the basis that negotiations with all EFTA applicants are concluded in the near future, the European Union's first priority will be the ratification process and then &mdash; given a yes vote in each of the applicant countries&mdash;the integration of the new members.  The European Union's agenda also includes the Maastricht Review Conference scheduled for 1996 at which issues fundamental to the future direction of the Union are likely to be raised.  It is difficult at this stage to offer any precise estimate as to the timing of further enlargement negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 74 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>UN involvement in the holding of a referendum in Western Sahara began in 1991 when the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 690 which established MINURSO (UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), which is responsible for organising the referendum in which the people are to choose between integration with Morocco and independence.  Six Irish Army officers are at present serving with MINURSO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress towards the referendum has proved difficult.  On 2 March 1993 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 809 which requested the UN Secretary-General to report on the prospects and modalities for the holding of a free and fair referendum by the end of 1993 at the latest.  The Secretary-General visited the region on 31 May-4 June 1993 and reported to the Security Council in November. The key difficulty continues to be the criteria for voter eligibility.  The Secretary-General reported that the Frente POLISARIO maintain substantial reservations on the United Nations' proposed compromise on this issue while the Moroccan side has rejected any attempt at modifying the compromise text in its present form.  In view of this the Secretary-General concluded that it would not be possible to arrange the referendum before the end of 1993 but expressed the hope that the <Col N="1314" /> negotiations could be satisfactorily concluded in the first half of 1994.  He warned, however, that any estimated date set at this stage would still bear little meaning unless both parties were to demonstrate a spirit of co-operation and forbearance, without which the implementation of the settlement plan would continue to be evasive.</P>
    <P>UN efforts to resolve the situation are continuing.  The Secretary-General's special representative, Mr. Yaqub Khan, is in the region at present, where he is working to bring the two sides closer together.</P>
    <P>Ireland agrees with the conclusions of the Secretary-General and fully supports his efforts to secure agreement between the parties involved, and to bring about a free and fair referendum at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 63 together.  I indicated, in a response to a question in this House on 27 January, that the <Col N="1315" /> Government has consistently conveyed concerns to the British Government over the adequacy of the existing criminal law as it relates to the use of lethal force by the security forces, the operation of controls over the use of such force and the accountability of those involved.  I indicated also that the Government has called, through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference, for a thorough examination of the whole area of the use of lethal force by the security forces.  In this context, I stated that the notion of a new offence &mdash; other than manslaughter or murder&mdash;is among a range of ideas and suggestions that we have put to and discussed with the British side through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
      <P>I discussed the matter further with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the last meeting of the Conference on 28 January.  While it would not be appropriate for me to go into details, I can confirm that Sir Patrick Mayhew and his colleagues briefed me on the progress of a review which is being carried out on the British side in relation to the criminal law, including proposed reforms to the law, and the guidance, practice and follow up procedures relating to the use of force.  We will be considering this matter further at the next meeting of the Conference.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in regular contact with our honorary consuls in Turkey and Thailand and their staff.  Under the present system of handling visa applications, honorary consuls are obliged to refer all applications to Dublin for consideration. The majority of these applications, on receipt in my Department, are referred to the Department of Justice for decision.  The procedure normally works well but inevitably difficulties and delays occur occasionally.</P>
      <P>I understand that visas for business people from Thailand and Turkey are normally issued within one week.  In the case of others, such as tourists and students, the normal waiting period is three to four weeks.  We will continue to monitor the visa application process and, wherever possible, endeavour to reduce the waiting period for applicants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 90 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that in a communiqué issued on 15 February, the Liberian parties reaffirmed their commitment to the Cotonou Agreement as <Col N="1317" /> the basis for a lasting political settlement to the Liberian conflict.  They agreed that disarmament would begin and that a transitional government would be installed on 7 March 1994 and that elections would be held on 7 Sepember 1994.  I welcome the issuance of the communiqué and would urge all the parties to adhere to the timetable contained in it.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Secretary General's report of 14 February outlines the progress of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, UNOMIL.  UNOMIL has now reached its full strength and deployment throughout the country is underway.  The expansion of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group, ECOMOG, has been long called for and I am happy to note in the Secretary-General's report that battalions from Tanzania and Uganda arrived in Monrovia in January.  Consultations are continuing with Zimbabwe for the deployment of their troops.  This progress in the deployment of both the UNOMIL observers and of the additional ECOMOG troops is indeed to be welcomed.  Progress in other areas includes the establishment of an elections commission, which consists of representatives of the three Liberian parties, to organise and to carry out the elections.</P>
    <P>This progress should not obscure the many difficulties which remain in Liberia. Fighting continues in a number of regions, which has led to the loss of lives, destruction of property and the displacement of many people.  The impediments to access for humanitarian supplies in certain areas is a matter for concern also.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the Government provided £55,000 from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund for Liberian Refugees in Sierra Leone.  A further £19,000 was provided through the NGO cofinancing scheme to projects providing care for children displaced by the conflict. I readily accept that the humanitarian situation in Liberia, and the large influx of Liberian refugees into neighbouring states, remains a cause for concern. Accordingly, the Government is favourably disposed to continuing to make <Col N="1318" /> funds available for relief operations in Liberia and the other countries affected. Ireland continues to closely monitor developments in Liberia.</P>

      <P>The Amnesty International report entitled <i>Political Killings in Northern Ireland</i> addresses a number of important questions of serious and continuing concern to the Government, which have been the subject of discussions with the British Government through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  For example, the question of the use of lethal force by the security forces was discussed at the most recent meeting of the conference on 28 January.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International states in its report that it opposes human rights abuses carried out by armed political groups.  The Government's view remains that all violent activities by Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries against whomsoever directed are totally unacceptable. The Government will continue to keep the matters addressed by the Amnesty International report under close review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 62 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No change is envisaged in the role of <Col N="1320" /> the Irish contingent serving with UNOSOM II in Somalia when a number of the other contingents serving there are withdrawn by the end of this month.  The Irish contingent, which has been deployed in the Baidoa area since September 1993, will be rotated within the next few days, having completed its six-month tour of duty, and will be replaced by a further contingent of similar size which is also due to serve with UNOSOM II for six months to September this year. Both the current contingent, and its replacement, will be engaged on the same tasks, namely, the provision of essential supplies, fuel, food and water, to the other military components of UNOSOM II.  It also assists in the movement of the stores and equipment of units which are deploying or redeploying in the mission area.  In addition, the Irish contingent assists the Irish aid agencies Concern and Goal as well as other humanitarian agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to maintain Ireland's participation in the Somalia operation was announced on 22 February and follows on the Security Council's unanimous decision of 4 February to maintain UNOSOM II in Somalia with a revised mandate.  While still within the terms of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the revised mandate is much closer than its predecessor to the consensual approach of traditional UN peace-keeping. This change of emphasis &mdash; away from peace enforcement and towards peacekeeping, and with greater reliance being placed on the co-operation of the Somali parties &mdash; is a welcome development.  It is my view that UN peace enforcement and peacekeeping missions must be conducted within an overall political framework and that every opportunity to promote reconciliation must be exploited.  It is my hope that the revised mandate for UNOSOM II will serve to strengthen that approach in Somlia.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to maintain our participation in Somalia is a reaffirmation that we are prepared to uphold the role of the UN, even in difficult and complex situations.  The UN <Col N="1321" /> Secretary-General has determined that without the stabilising presence of an adequate UN force, there would be an early resumption of civil strife and an unravelling of all that has been achieved in Somalia.  I share his assessment.</P>
    <P>In reaching its decision, the Government was mindful of the paramount consideration of the safety and security of Irish personnel serving with UNOSOM II.  Particular attention was paid to the latest security assessment provided by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, following his discussions with senior UN officials in New York last month, and to the visit of the Chief of Staff to Somalia shortly before the decision was taken.  The Government also took into account the declared intention of a number of countries, mainly Western, to withdraw their contingents from the force by the end of this month.  Despite the uncertainty about the future which their departure has given rise to, it is important to note that UNOSOM II will continue to be a large UN operation.  The United Nations estimate is that the strength of the force will be in excess of 20,000 personnel, contributed by 19 countries, once the withdrawals have taken place next month.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to keep the situation in Somalia under thorough and ongoing review.  The House will have a further opportunity to consider the situation in the context of the report by the Minister for Defence to the Dáil pursuant to the terms of section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.  In addition, I intend to keep the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs advised of any notable developments in relation to Ireland's continued participation in Somalia.</P>

      <P>Our network of resident diplomatic missions is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future because of our limited financial resources.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to envisage establishing a resident Embassy in Budapest at the present time.</P>

      <P>During his official visit to Ireland in January of this year, the Prime Minister of Finland, Mr. Eskzo Aho, addressed the Institute for European Affairs on the topic &ldquo;Finland and Europe in Transition&rdquo;.  This was a wide ranging address, covering various Finnish concerns prior to their likely accession to the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of that address, the Prime Minister reaffirmed that Finland accepted the political objectives of the Maastricht Treaty and its provisions concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  He said that Finland intended <Col N="1323" /> to contribute actively and constructively to the formulation and implementation of those policies.  They were open-minded about the future and did not exclude any options.</P>
    <P>With regard to Finland's own security policy, the Prime Minister stated that, traditionally, this was based on the maintenance of a strong independent defence without membership of any military alliance.  In this context, he expressed himself satisfied as to the outcome of negotiations between Finland and the European Union on the Chapter on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which were concluded last December.</P>
    <P>There is a number of similarities between the security policies followed by Finland and Ireland, but there are also significant differences arising from differing historical experiences and geographical factors.  I would hope that, following Finland's accession to the European Union, we would work closely with Finland, as with other partners in the Union, in future development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the review which is expected to take place at the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.  The evolution of Finnish thinking in this area and also the evolution of thinking generally, will of course be a matter of considerable interest to us.</P>

      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference the importance of ensuring that the rights and identities of the two traditions in Northern Ireland are fully respected.</P>

      <P>The European Economic Area Agreement between the EU and EFTA member states &mdash; except Switzerland &mdash; formally entered into force on 1 January 1994.  The agreement forms a very useful foundation for the current enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</P>
      <P>The agreement effectively extends to the participating EFTA countries the European Union's single market, allowing free movement of goods, services, capital and labour across a 17-state area. Institutional arrangements, including arrangements for an EEA Council at ministerial level, form part of the agreement. There is provision for increased co-operation in areas such as social policy, consumer protection, the environment, research and development and education.</P>
      <P>Ireland is well placed to benefit from easier access to this large and economically developed market for our goods and services.  In 1992 our trade surplus with the participating EFTA countries was IR£33 million approximately.</P>
      <P>In addition, together with Spain, Portugal and Greece, Ireland sought inclusion in the agreement of provisions to promote economic and social cohesion.  As part of these provisions a cohesion fund has been set up under the agreement and is expected to be in operation shortly.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, since its establishment in 1986 the International Fund for Ireland has been generously supported by the United States of America, the European Union, Canada and New Zealand.  The total cumulative resources which have been made available to the fund to date amount to some £250 million pounds, with the United States and the European Union being the major contributors.</P>
      <P>The current EU commitment to the fund of 45 million ECU covers the three year period 1992-1994, of which the 1992 and 1993 contributions have already been received.  The US contribution is voted on a yearly basis.  Its 20 million dollars contribution for 1994 has been approved by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton.  The Government is currently in contact with both the EU and US Authorities concerning their respective contributions to the fund for 1995.</P>
      <P>The international welcome accorded to the Joint Declaration augurs well for the ability of the International Fund for Ireland to continue to attract the support which enables it to carry out its valuable work in Northern Ireland and in the six Border counties in the South.  The Government will continue its efforts to secure maximum international support for the International Fund for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The question of <Col N="1328" /> human rights violations in El Salvador during the twelve year civil war in that country has been the subject of UN sponsored investigations since the signing of the Salvadorean Peace Accords in 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of those accords two investigative commissions were established, the Ad-Hoc Investigative Commission and the Truth Commission, to examine the issue of human rights violations in El Salvador, including the question of murder and death squad activities involving members of the armed forces, the administration and the judiciary.</P>
      <P>Both commissions have published their reports naming those responsible for such violations and recommending their immediate dismissal and exclusion from the armed forces and all forms of public office.  A number of these recommendations have been implemented but in certain cases the holders of high office remain in power.  The UN Secretary General is actively engaged in efforts to bring about the full implementation of the Truth Commission's recommendations which has now become more urgent following recent assassinations in El Salvador of leading FMLN members and landowners.</P>
      <P>On 3 November last the Secretary General mandated the Human Rights Director of ONUSAL, the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, to investigate recent murders and the activities of private armed groups in El Salvador and to work with the Salvadorean authorities and others to try to bring about the full implementation of the Truth Commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Our concerns in relation to human rights abuses in El Salvador, which are shared by partners in the Twelve, have been communicated to the authorities in El Salvador.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union, or CFSP, is founded on Title V of the Maastricht Treaty.  The provisions of this Title were designed to enable the member states of the Union to develop their co-operation on foreign and security policy issues and to permit the Union to play a fuller and more coherent role in international affairs commensurate with its standing and responsibilities in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty on 1 November last year and the inception of the CFSP, the Union has been active in many areas of international life and played a leading role in relation to a number of important issues. These include its attempt to resolve the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East Peace Process, the establishment of democracy in South Africa, <Col N="1330" /> and the development of the Union's relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Ireland has played an active and constructive role in the formulation of the Union's policy in relation to these and other matters under the CFSP.</P>
    <P>In the period between the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in February 1992 and its entry into force, Irish representatives, including the Taoiseach and myself, were involved in discussions intended to ensure that the necessary arrangements and procedures were in place to allow the CFSP to be fully functional from its inception.  This detailed preparation made it possible for the Council of Ministers of the Union to act immediately on the entry into force of the Treaty to adopt Joint Actions on:</P>
    <P>&mdash;humanitarian aid to Bosnia;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the sending of European Union observers to last month's elections in Russia;</P>
    <P>&mdash;support for the transition towards a democratic and multi-racial South Africa; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the launching of an initiative for a Stability Pact in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken the necessary steps to ensure that Ireland has made, or will be in a position to make, a full contribution to the implementation of these Joint Actions.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An observer team, including four members of the Oireachtas, was sent to Russia as part of the European Union's effort to observe the parliamentary elections.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Two Army officers have been seconded to the European Union Electoral Unit set up to identify and co-ordinate the Union's support for April's elections in South Africa.  In addition, a team of 24 observers, partly made up of members of the Oireachtas, is currently being assembled as part of the European <Col N="1331" /> Union's arrangements for monitoring the elections.</P>
    <P>&mdash;As regards Bosnia, the Government will arrange for the provision of the necessary additional contribution in humanitarian aid, once the key for member states' contribution of 24 million ecu has been decided.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that Ireland should continue to play the fullest possible role in the development of the CFSP.  I am confident that Ireland, through its participation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union can effectively project its values and pursue its concerns in the international arena.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty provides that the common foreign and security policy of the European Union shall include all questions related to the security of the Union including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence. Decisions on the scope and content of a common defence policy and on the question of a common defence are left to future negotiations and, in particular, to the Intergovernmental Conference to take place in 1996.</P>

      <Quest>in connection with Knocknashee Hill Fort, an enclosure dating back to about 100 BC and the third largest such enclosure in the country, having within it one megalithic passage tomb probably dating from 3500 BC, a bronze age cairn and dwelling places, at least 30 feet, if it is intended that it will be declared a national monument to afford it appropriate recognition and legal protection in view of the great importance of this prehistoric site; if a plaque will be erected giving some general information to the visitors who go there every year; if an adequate access way will be provided to the hilltop; and if the necessary excavation work will be carried out on at least one of the hut dwellings; if he will make a statement on the general intentions regarding this very important prehistoric site which so far seems to have been totally overlooked in all plans; and if he will provide all possible assistance to the local Knocknashee heritage group which is seeking to bring due recognition to this fine national monument.</Quest>

      <P>Arrangements are in hand to have Knocknashee Hillfort entered in the Register of Historic Monuments. This registration will afford protection to the site under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1987.  Knocknashee is in private ownership and as such the Commissioners of Public Works would be precluded from carrying out any works there.  The Commissioners have already been in correspondence with the Knocknashee Heritage Group. When the registration has been finalised, the Office of Public Works will have further discussions with the local Heritage Group.</P>

      <P>The Free Travel Companion Pass, which I introduced in 1990, is a special version of the Free Travel Pass which enables anyone over 16 years of age to travel free with the pass-holder. The Free Travel Companion Pass is intended to meet the situation where a person is entitled to free travel under the Free Travel Scheme but cannot make any real use of the concession because of some disability that prevents them from travelling alone.</P>
      <P>Companion Passes were issued originally to people who were receiving disabled person's maintenance allowance and who were certified by their health board to be unable to travel alone.  Since then, I have been able to make companion passes available to additional groups of disabled people such as the blind and people confined to wheel chairs.  Many of the holders of the companion pass are elderly single people but, in all cases, their entitlement is based on the fact that they are disabled to the extent that they are unable to travel alone.  I hope to extend this facility to further categories of disabled people as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The Government fully recognises the strong tradition of support and respect for the family in Ireland and the importance of the family in our national life.  In designating 1994 as the International Year of the Family, the United Nations have strongly encouraged the active participation of Non-Governmental Organisations in celebrating the Year and have indicated that their efforts should be supported at State level by way of financial and technical assistance.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Government has decided that the Steering Committee representing voluntary family organisations, which was established in 1992 to undertake preparations for the year, should retain its existing status of representing the non-governmental sector and should be allocated a grant-in-aid to assist them in their preparations for the year.  An allocation of £400,000 was made to the Steering Committee at the official launch of the International Year in Ireland on 14 February last.  The Steering Committe is now in the process of setting up its own office and secretariat and will be assisting family organisations in celebrating the year.</P>
      <P>In addition to its commitment to the work of the Steering Committee, the Government has established an InterDepartmental Committee to prepare its own programme for the year.  That committee, which is under the aegis of my Department, and representing all the relevant Government Departments dealing with the family, will work closely with the Steering Committee in relation to overall co-ordination of events to mark the year.</P>

      <P>The job-sharing scheme for the health service was introduced in 1985.  The terms of the scheme provide that the operation and maintenance of job-sharing arrangements are a matter for the management of each health agency and must necessarily depend on the demands of the service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly; the management of the Southern Health Board has responsibility for the operation and maintenance of job-sharing arrangements amongst the Board's nursing and other employees. The Board has indicated that it is fully committed to facilitate both now and in the future as many staff as possible with job-sharing subject to service demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent annual Health Services Personnel Census carried out by my Department shows that 407 nurses were employed in a job-sharing capacity by the Southern Health Board at 31 December, 1992.  Over 200 more nurses were job-sharing in the Board at that date than at 31 December, 1988.  This illustrates the progress that the Southern Health Board has made in terms of expanding job-sharing <Col N="1355" /> opportunities.  I would like to acknowledge the Board's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to add in relation to the operation of the job-sharing scheme more generally that I am committed to encouraging health agencies to allow the scheme to be used to the fullest extent possible.  I recently wrote to the Chief Executive Officers of the Health Boards exhorting them to adopt as flexible an approach as possible in relation to accommodating staff wishing to avail of the scheme.  Within the context of overall personnel policy for the health services for 1994, details of which will be circulated to health agencies soon, it is my intention to emphasise the positive aspects of the job-sharing scheme and to ask each health agency to make every effort to ensure that the opportunities for greater participation in the scheme that exist are fully exploited.</P>

      <P>I am acutely aware of the very valuable contribution made by voluntary groups under the aegis of the hospice movement, in the provision of hospice and home care for the terminally ill.  In many instances, multidiciplinary care is provided for such patients in co-operation with local hospital and community care services. Partnership and co-operation between the statutory agencies and voluntary bodies working in this area is essential in order to ensure that services for the terminally ill can be provided in a planned, <Col N="1356" /> co-ordinated and cost effective manner.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation has had close interaction with the Western Health Board since its foundation in 1992.  In relation to the question of funding for hospice projects, the position is that national lottery grants have been provided by my Department for hospice projects.  A standard application form for national lottery funds has recently issued to the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation for completion.</P>
      <P>In relation to ongoing funding and development costs, I suggest that the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation discuss these questions with the authorities in the Western Health Board, which is the statutory body responsible for the provision of health services in the area.</P>

      <P>At present there are four psychologists serving post primary schools in the North Dublin area.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to extend the psychological service to all primary schools.  In line with this commitment, I have announced my intention to begin extending the service during the current year based on the experience of the pilot project for the development of a psychological service to primary schools which operated in two areas, West Tallaght-Clondalkin and South Tipperary. In arranging for this extension the particular needs of other areas will be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>The areas to which the service will be extended have not yet been finalised.</P>

      <P>It has not been the practice to disclose details of grants sanctioned or paid to individual school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, pleased to state that the physical planning of the new toilet block is being progressed with the assistance of my Department's local professional advisers who have provided the <Col N="1359" /> school authorities with the necessary drawings to enable them to seek planning permission for the project.</P>
