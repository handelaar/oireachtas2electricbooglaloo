    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I made a short but successful visit to the United States from 12 to 15 May.  As is the case with all my visits there, I sought to advance two principal objectives which mirror the two top priorities of this Government.</P>
      <P>First, I availed of every appropriate opportunity to promote the efforts of the Irish and British Governments regarding advancement of the peace process and the development of an agreed political settlement.  Second, I sought, in direct contacts with some US business leaders, to promote increased investment into Ireland, increased exports to the United States and, on that basis, increased job creation.  The visit, though short, was very successful in terms of both objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, I used every appropriate occasion to consolidate the overwhelming support which exists in the United States for the balanced set of principles of the Joint Declaration, for the ending of all forms of violence, and for the development of a political settlement. I regard as particularly significant the widespread and solid support of the Irish-American community.  The overwhelming <Col N="4" /> majority of them are anxious to assist the advancement of the peace process and are willing to use their considerable influence to that end.  It was particularly appropriate, therefore, that my commencement address at the conferral of an honorary degree ceremony by the University of Notre Dame focused on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Notre Dame is a distinguished institution of academic excellence which enjoys a strong historical association with Irish America.  Thus, my address at the conferral ceremony afforded me a unique opportunity to help harness the enormous influence and goodwill which exists among Irish Americans for this country. I therefore set out in a clear and balanced way the efforts of the Irish and British Governments in terms of realising the heartfelt desire among our peoples for an end to the corrosive evil of violence. Within this context, I also promoted the intensive discussions currently under way between the two Governments on a joint framework document as a basis for a resumption of the three-strand talks process leading, it is hoped, to an agreed political settlement that could be accepted by all sides as fair, balanced and just.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I had a meeting in Indianapolis on 14 May with President Clinton.  The President was most anxious to be brought up to date on recent developments relating to the peace process and the Northern Ireland situation generally.  Within this context, he expressed a particular desire to be informed of the position pertaining at that time in regard to Sinn Féin's requests for clarification of the Joint Declaration from the British Government.  I told the President that his personal interest and full support for the joint efforts of the two Governments to advance the peace process in a source of great encouragement to all of us.  It is important that the momentum for peace is sustained and, therefore, great importance attaches to his support in this regard.</P>
    <P>I informed the President that on numerous occasions I had called on Sinn Féin to spell out clearly those points <Col N="5" /> needing clarification, so that they could be responded to objectively.  Sinn Féin, in response, had forwarded to me, through a community leader, a list of points on which clarification was sought from the British Government.  When I had satisfied myself that the points to be forwarded could be legitimately answered without entering into negotiation, I conveyed them to the British Government in the expectation that the responses, as well as the questions, would be made public by them shortly afterwards. The President shared my hope that this development would bring to a close the long drawn-out process of clarification.</P>
    <P>He was very grateful for the update which I provided on the Northern Ireland situation and, in the course of our discussions, he stated on a number of occasions that he and his administration stand ready, at any time, to help in the most constructive way possible the efforts of the two Governments to achieve lasting peace and durable political settlement. The Government are deeply appreciative of this rock-solid support. Our discussions also covered recent developments relating to the Israeli-Pale-stinian peace agreement, as well as the prospects for a new era of peace and stability in South Africa following the recent elections there.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the clarification of the Declaration which the British Government have provided, this response, when taken in conjunction with the very substantial clarification previously given by both Governments, is sufficiently comprehensive and positive to move the peace process forward a decisive step.  I regard the protracted process of clarification as being effectively concluded, this opening the way to the next stage in the peace process which is a decision by all those concerned to bring paramilitary violence to an end.</P>
    <P>For both Governments, a permanent cessation of violence is required so that all parties can participate fully in the shaping of a new agreed future for all the people on this island.  That, in essence, is the challenge and the opportunity for <Col N="6" /> Sinn Féin.  The conditions are now uniquely suitable for that party to partake in full democratic engagement towards the realisation of lasting peace with justice in Ireland.  I, therefore, welcome Sinn Féin's commitment to consider carefully and meticulously the response of the British Government, but in the meantime, there should be no more killings.</P>
    <P>I have made clear on many occasions in the past that peace also demands a permanent halt to the violence being waged by loyalist paramilitaries.  Both campaigns of terror are equally reprehensible and utterly futile.  What political objective can possibly be advanced by the indiscriminate killing of innocent Catholic youths, by the attempt at mass carnage in Dublin over the weekend, or by blowing up a cleaner and leaving his three year old daughter's life hanging by a thread for several days before showing signs of a welcome recovery?  It must surely be clear that no Irish Government will ever seek to coerce the people of Northern Ireland into a united Ireland against the wishes of a majority there. Rock-solid commitments exist in that regard.  I reject any attempts by the loyalist paramilitaries to justify their actions as a demonstation against any coercion of Unionists.  Even the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis confirmed its rejection of coercion against the Unionists.  Therefore, the loyalist paramilitaries should take fully on board Mr. James Molyneaux's statement of Friday last and call an immediate cessation to their campaign of terror.</P>
    <P>Regarding a possible visit to Ireland by President Clinton, I have already formally invited him to visit here.  The President has responded that he would very much like to do so at a mutually convenient time.  I know that the House would very much share my hope that a visit here by such a special friend of Ireland will take place in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>As I already stated, I availed of my short visit to the US to promote Ireland, wherever appropriate, as a location for US investment as well as the provision of a broader base for increased exports in both the manufacturing and services <Col N="7" /> areas.  To this end, I had discussions with a number of US business leaders who are seeking to expand their overseas operations. I placed special emphasis on the advantages which Ireland, as a gateway to Europe, can offer to US multinational firms.  While it would be inappropriate to give full details of these meetings, both Abbott Laboratories and Motorola confirmed to me in Chicago their decisions to expand their operations in Ireland. These and other recent announcements by a number of US multinational firms to establish manufacturing bases or expand their existing operations here testify to the real economic worth of such visits.</P>
    <P>The level of inward investment this year has been quite exceptional and I am very glad to have been able to play some part in helping to bring to fruition particular projects, such as the new FINEX Exchange in the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Is the Government satisfied that the clarification process has reached finality? Does the Taoiseach see loyalist violence as being reactive to the IRA or does he believe they are pursuing their own agenda?  What additional measures has the Government in mind to counteract the spread of such violence?  The best approach now would be for the two Governments to agree the joint framework for a comprehensive political settlement. Does the Taoiseach expect this to be agreed at this meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, later this week and, if so, when does he expect the proposals to be presented to the constitutional parties for discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the clarification issue as closed.  For a period, loyalist violence was reactive but it is now proactive.  I do not know what agenda it is following.  The statement issued after claiming responsibility for the Dublin bombing, saying it wanted to demonstrate it would not succumb to coercion, does not stand up.  That issue <Col N="8" /> was dealt with unequivocally in the Downing Street Declaration and, in response to a challenge by me, Sinn Féin made it clear at its Ard-Fheis that it was not pursuing a policy of coercing loyalists into a united Ireland.  I do not know its agenda but I hope political leaders in the North will repeat that message to their people and they might see that it is futile to engage in that type of violence.  We have had violence for 25 years and it has not succeeded in advancing the cause of either community.</P>
      <P>The framework document being put together by both Governments is well advanced and it is our expectation that it will be completed before the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach reconcile the sweet words of Sinn Féin in favour of the peace process with the actions of the IRA over the last week? Will he permit Sinn Féin to spin out the consultation process indefinitely?  As regards his comment that loyalist violence is no longer reactive does he agree loyalist paramilitaries believe they can shoot and bomb their way to the conference table as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Unionist population to decide who represents them on a political basis.  They have ways and means of electing their own people.  I do not know what the Deputy means by &ldquo;sweet words&rdquo;.  I have used a balanced approach to the complex situation in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not talking about the Taoiseach but about Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the question does not refer to me it should be directed to where it can be answered.  I am not in a position to answer for either side.  I took the view from the beginning that it must be even-handed and balanced.  The members of both communities must be taken on board in an even-handed manner, otherwise there will not be progress.  There is sufficient evidence to suggest that, unfortunately, loyalist violence is proactive.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that despite the peace process more people were killed in the first five months of this year than in the first five months of last year?  Is he further aware that loyalists are imitating apparently successful IRA tactics?  Can he not see that any process which rewards an organisation which is still using violence, such as the IRA, with political recognition encourages other organisations like loyalists to imitate what has been successful for the Provos?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how Deputy Bruton can say IRA violence has been successful &mdash; it has been in existence for 25 years and it is as futile today as it was the day it started.  I do not understand the point he is trying to make in that regard.  If he is suggesting that no effort should have been made by either Government in pursuing a peace process. I totally disagree with him, as would the vast majority of Irish people.  The number of people killed is a fact of life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We need an entire revision of our current policy position.</P>

      <P>I challenged Sinn Féin to state clearly and unequivocally at its Ard-Fheis that it was not its policy to coerce unionists to join a united Ireland. This was very important from the point of view of unionists and loyalists who continually make the point that they are fearful of being coerced into a united Ireland.  It is important to have all these statements on the record.</P>
      <P>As I have done today in the House, I will continue to challenge both sides.  I will challenge loyalists to issue what they may perceive as justification for the bomb in Dublin which, in their first statement, they said was to demonstrate quite clearly that they would not accept or succumb to coercion.  The Joint Peace Declaration makes it clear that there will be no coercion, and Sinn Féin, which is engaged in the conflict in Northern Ireland, has said coercion is not on its agenda.  What is the justification for planting bombs in Dublin when the whole issue of coercion has been clearly and unequivocally dealt with by both Governments and by the other paramilitary organisation?</P>

      <P>Apart from sending out a political message that violence will not achieve any purpose, will the Taoiseach assure the House that whatever additional security measures can be taken will be taken to ensure that loyalist violence is contained so far as possible? In regard to the Taoiseach's reply that the agreed framework between the two Governments should be ready for presentation to the parties before the end of June, will he confirm to the House that irrespective of the decision of Sinn Féin-IRA, those proposals will be presented to the constitutional parties and that if Sinn Féin-IRA do not agree to a cessation of violence, the scene will shift back to the constitutional parties and discussions will get under way so far as the Irish Government is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be made very <Col N="13" /> clear &mdash; I have said this on a number of occasions but the message does not seem to be getting through &mdash; that neither Government is standing aside and giving centre stage to the paramilitaries.  We are continuing to advance the framework document.  There is nothing to stop the parties getting around the table tomorrow if they so wish.  Deputies should ask what parties are refusing to come to the table and direct attention and pressure to those areas.  The Irish Government is ready to sit around the table at any hour of any day, as are the SDLP and the Alliance Party.  According to them, the Official Unionists are not yet ready to go back to the table.  The Irish Government, the SDLP and the Alliance Party are not holding up the talks process.</P>
      <P>Work on the framework document has been continuing for some considerable time and we expect it to be concluded by the end of June.  In no way are we standing back, as the Deputy and others have put it, and waiting for a decision by Sinn Féin or the loyalist paramilitaries.  We will go ahead with that process irrespective of whether they respond.</P>
      <P>The clarification issue has been completed and is out of the way and the next decision required is one which will lead to a cessation of violence so that the peace process can go ahead.  Irrespective of the decisions made by Sinn Féin and the loyalist paramilitaries, the two Governments will not be deflected from pursuing the peace process.  As soon as we are ready for the talks the document will be put on the table and one would hope that by then all parties would be in a position to join the talks process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that Sinn Féin is the tool of the IRA, the blood stained hand of the IRA, that it is not the other way around?  Will he agree also that Sinn Féin and the IRA are engaged in coercion, that the blowing up of the cleaner and his little child was coercion and nothing else?  Will he further agree that, with perhaps the sole <Col N="14" /> exception of himself, nobody in this House takes seriously what was said in Tallaght?  Finally, will he agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is about time groups were prohibited and dissuaded by the Garda from organising, in inner city areas of my constituency and other events which are described as &ldquo;in relief of prisoners of war&rdquo;, the organisation of which, apparently, the IRA plays a leading part?  Will the Taoiseach give some indication of the steps he proposes to take to ensure that such events do not recur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland security forces and the security forces in the South co-operate excellently in this matter and they are continuing their discussions on how security can be improved.  In spite of the large number of soldiers involved in the effort to police the situation in Northern Ireland, unfortunately day after day terrorists on either side both break through security cordons and plant bombs or shoot people.  Yesterday, at the canal launch which was attended by many high ranking people, a bomb was found up river.  We have to be realistic about this issue, every effort is being taken and people have to be vigilant.</P>
      <P>On the other part of this question, Deputy McDowell misunderstands and misreads the situation more often then anyone I know.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to understand the fears and suspicions of both communities and, indeed, their inward thinking. If the Deputy spoke with those people as often as I do he might have a better appreciation of what is in their minds.  It is mistaken to think that one will <Col N="15" /> achieve a cessation of violence without addressing the fears of both communities and the reasons they put forward in justification of some of the dreadful murders carried out time and time again.  I have never accepted those reasons.  Repeatedly in this House I have condemned those outrageous, sectarian, vicious murders as much as anybody else.  To endeavour to put forward any other perception of it amounts to self-deceit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret some of the less than precise language used by the Taoiseach today which has led to a difference of opinion in the House which was not evident on previous occasions and which is particularly out of keeping in view of the events which occurred in this city last Saturday night.  We could be mourning the loss of more than 200 lives.  Would he agree that the difference between the clarified Downing Street Joint Declaration and what Sinn Féin-IRA appears to be asking is not worth a single finger, whether on this or the other side of the Border?  Would he agree that the fact that Sinn Féin-IRA have not declared a cessation of violence is a strong indication of something I have believed for some time, which is that there is an element in that organisation which has decided that their only way forward is by sectarian confrontation?  That is what they are aiming for and they are delighted at what was attempted in this city on last Saturday evening.  Finally, would he demand, on behalf of a unified Dáil, that Sinn Féin-IRA &mdash; one cannot differentiate between them &mdash; at the very least should call an immediate ceasefire?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said and am quite happy to repeat that this House unanimously calls on the total republican movement and on the loyalist paramilitaries for a total cessation of violence because that in which they are engaged is not worth the taking of a single life.  I have already said so in previous answers here today.</P>

      <P>That is the tone I am displaying.  If some others choose to endeavour to shift ground or in some way to take from the peace process in which the two Governments are engaged, so be it.  I will continue on the road I have taken.  I have said for quite a long time that the Downing Street Joint Declaration addresses the suspicions and fears for the future of both communities, and, consequently, there is no need for anybody to endeavour to justify any acts of violence.  I repeat that the challenge to all political leaders, North and South, is to endeavour to change the minds and hearts of those people who feel that their cause is more important than the taking of a single life.  I could not agree more with Deputy Currie that there should not be another life lost.  Between the Downing Street Joint Declaration and its clarification, it has been made quite clear to both communities that their fears have been addressed, that they can lay down their arms, get around the table and work out an accommodation so that there will be no need for violence by either community in the future.</P>

While I welcome the Taoiseach's <Col N="17" /> discussions with the Motorola Corporation, will he ensure that those discussions are brought forward as a matter of urgency so that we may see additional employment in an area which has suffered so badly from redundancies in Aer Lingus and elsewhere?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Ray Burke seeks to ring the wagons, may we revert to what is in the minds of people in Dublin this week?  Is the Taoiseach still reluctant to name a deadline for an end to the artificial consultation process of Sinn Féin/IRA?  Having regard to the fact that loyalist violence has accounted for more than half the deaths so far this year, will he say whether the two Governments have any specific proposals to address its underlying causes and whether he has any intention of meeting the British Prime Minister soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying causes of the violence should be clear to everybody at this stage.  They are very clear to me and to anybody who takes time to study them, to listen to the people who are suffering as a result.  On the one hand, the people on the Nationalist side have been subjected to coercion &mdash; if one might describe it as such &mdash; in being part of a Northern state they never wanted to be part of and see themselves as having been treated as second-class citizens over the past 50 years, or more.  They believe they are not afforded the parity of esteem they believe they are entitled to.  On the <Col N="18" /> other hand, the Unionist community are not certain where their future lies <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British Government.  The Downing Street Joint Declaration addressed those fears and their underlying causes, and set out the way forward.  Deputy Michael McDowell can shake his head and smile at a very serious, complex matter if he so wishes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to make a laugh of this he can, but I am sure the House would agree with me that one must address the underlying causes and talk to the people involved in both communities, the people suffering from the violence.  When one studies the contents of the Downing Street Joint Declaration, one sees that the underlying causes of violence are addressed.  Until the men of violence can be convinced by the people supporting them or giving them succour that they should cease and allow the democratic process take place, that will remain the challenge confronting us.  Nobody ever thought it would be easy, or that one could switch it off at the flick of a finger.  I want to confirm that both Governments are not waiting for Sinn Féin to go through their consultative process.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are saying they can call off the violence today and take, three months or six months for their consultative process if they so wish.  That is the position as we see it.  The two Governments will continue our framework programme, as soon as it is ready, with or without them.  We should like to think that, by then, there would be a cessation of violence with, hopefully, all parties sitting at the one table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that he is beginning to appear increasingly naive when, five months after the Downing Street Joint Declaration, <Col N="19" /> with more killings since then than in the preceding five months of last year, he still seems to think that the loyalist terrorists and the republican terrorists are amenable to the sort of reasoning he has been putting forward here, bearing in mind that both of them are steeped up to their knees in rackets and make a living from crime and killing? These organisations have no intention of paying attention to statements of the kind the Taoiseach has been making.  Will he agree that it is time to revert to a realistic agenda of getting the constitutional parties to accept their responsibilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy John Bruton that it is time for all constitutional parties to accept their responsibilities.  I only hope that the constitutional parties in the North of Ireland will listen to that message so that we get back around the table.  We are ready to resume talks around the table tomorrow morning, as are the Nationalist parties. The Official Unionists and the DUP are not ready to come back to the table; that is the reality.  If Deputy Bruton is suggesting that the British Government and I should cease our work in endeavouring to achieve peace on this island, I cannot accept that.</P>

A copy of the draft defamation Bill produced by the National Newspapers of Ireland which was very recently received in my Department has been given some preliminary consideration.  At this stage of examination of the Bill it is far too early to offer a view as to whether I am in a position to recommend to the Government that the Bill be accepted in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that, at present, in line with other commitments in the Programme for Government, my Department is giving attention, as matters of priority, to a multiplicity of legislative proposals &mdash; 12 Bills in all &mdash; which are at various stages.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, which provides comprehensive measures to deal with the financial consequences of all marital breakdown, short of domestic divorce is at Report Stage in the House; an Adoptive Leave Bill is before the Seanad; a Maintenance Bill, which will facilitate the recovery of maintenance payments on a world-wide basis will be published within the next few weeks; a Civil Legal Aid Bill to put the legal aid scheme on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage of drafting; an Amendment of the Constitution (Divorce) Bill and draft heads of divorce legislation which has been promised for the information of the public in advance of the referendum are in the course of being considered on the <Col N="22" /> basis of widespread consultations with various groups; following the Government's recent approval of my proposals to strengthen and extend the courts' powers to deal with cases of domestic violence, a Bill is now being drafted; a Bill to give effect to an EC Directive on Pregnant Workers is also being drafted; proposals to amend the law on occupiers' liability, taking into account the Law Reform Commission's recent report, are being finalised for submission to Government with a view to a Bill being published this year as promised in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work;</i> proposals for a Bill on enduring powers of attorney, an Equal Status Bill and an Employment Equality Bill are at advanced stages of preparation.  It is my intention to proceed with this legislative programme as quickly as possible.  When the other measures have been disposed of it will be possible to deal with other important matters including reform of the law on defamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad for your sake that you do not have control over Ministers' replies.  Will the Minister join me in congratulating National Newspapers of Ireland on the initiative they have taken on the laws of defamation which have not been changed in 33 years?  When considering the matter will the Minister bear in mind the following questions; is he in favour of the abolition of juries in defamation cases?  Is he in favour of shifting the onus of proof from the defendant to the plaintiff?  Is he in favour <Col N="23" /> of a change in the law in relation to the defamation of the dead?  The latter issue is a matter of grave concern to many people in the community.  There is too much intrusion into private lives and into the private lives of people after death, of which we have had two recent examples?

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that Deputy Currie was disappointed with my reply.  I was trying to explain to him the volume of work in my Department and to put in context the priority of a law reform measure submitted by the National Newspapers of Ireland.  I agree that the law on defamation has not been dealt with statutorily for a long time.  The areas of defamation are extremely varied and complex.  The Law Reform Commission's recommendations consisted of approximately 15 or 17 different aspects of the law.  I cannot say at this stage what my reply is likely to be on any particular aspect of either the proposals of the National Newspapers of Ireland, who represent one side of the equation, or the various recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission.  I have to take all aspects of the matter into account.</P>
      <P>The interests of the public have to be considered, as well as those of the media, and a fair and reasonable balance will have to be struck when the time comes for a detailed consideration of law reform in this area.  I am broadly sympathetic to Deputy Currie's comment on the issue of slander and libel of the dead and I will examine the matter sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20, 30 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme of family law measures, which takes into account, among other matters, the White Paper on Marital Breakdown is well advanced.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, is awaiting Report Stage in the House, having been dealt with by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. That Bill deals with a wide range of matters, including age of marriage, notice of marriage, as well as financial powers of the court to provide for all situations of marital breakdown, short of domestic divorce.  A new maintenance Bill to facilitate the recovery of maintenance on an international scale will be published in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill to put the legal aid scheme on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage of drafting.  As part also of the Government's programme, a Bill to amend and <Col N="25" /> extend the provisions of the law regarding protection of persons from domestic violence is in the course of being drafted.</P>
    <P>My Department is, at present, examining proposals for legislation to provide simplified arrangements for voluntary conveyances of family homes to joint ownership.  The aim of such provision would be to enable couples to give full and effective recognition to the contributions made by the spouse who works in the home.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional funding has been provided in my Department's Estimates for 1994 for the development and expansion of legal aid, mediation and marriage counselling.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision on the timing of the referendum will take into account, among other matters, progress made with the Government's programme of family law measures.  It is the Government's intention to proceed with implementation of its programme as quickly as possible and to ensure that by the time of the referendum, the outstanding issue to be put to the people will be whether those whose marriages have ended in all but name should have the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision on the timing of the referendum will, if necessary, take into account the outcome of the decision of the court on the case that is pending concerning provisions in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill containing the referendum proposal on divorce will, as in the case of previous referendum proposals, be initiated in the Irish and English language and every care will be taken, with the assistance of the translation branch, to ensure, prior to publication of the Bill, that the texts are consistent with one another.</P>
    <P>I have noted the recent press reports of statements made by Archbishop Desmond Connell.  While I disagree with what he said about the effects which divorce will have on society I respect the fact that he is fully entitled to express his views on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is telling us he has no idea when the proposed divorce referendum will take place.  He informed us initially that it was proposed to hold it with the European elections in June and later that it would be held next October. Now we do not know if it will be held next year, which is regrettable.  We have a fiasco in terms of family law and a lack of credibility in the Minister.  He should agree that women in particular have expressed deep concern.  While I am conscious of the list of legislation the Minister outlined this afternoon his handling of this affair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is anxious to proceed with the divorce referendum at the earliest possible date.  It is progressing its programme of family law reform legislation.  I have outlined a multifarious list of necessary items which are proceeding apace and at various <Col N="27" /> stages in the House.  As the Deputy and the House are aware, a challenge is pending in the High Court to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and the divorce legislation is bound up with it.  It would not be possible to proceed with the referendum until this challenge has been disposed of.  I heard within the past few hours that the High Court has fixed 6-8 July for the hearing of that challenge.  We must await the outcome before we can consider the matter.  The intention is to proceed with the referendum with all possible speed taking all factors into account.</P>
      <P>Archbishop Desmond Connell, like any other person, is entitled to make statements.  I disagree with what he had to say and will continue to make my position clear during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister is allegedly driving the referendum on divorce and has said, rightly, that he is firmly in favour of it, does he agree it would be appropriate for him &mdash; when a public statement is made &mdash; to reply?  Does he also agree that if he is to show leadership it is not good enough to reply to questions at Question Time, he should adopt a proactive role in responding to such statements? The Minister did not reply to my question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As you pointed out, a Cheann Comhairle, that is a separate question.  I take my responsibilities in this matter seriously and I do not need guidance on how I should handle the matter or on what comments or statements I should reply to and when.  I will continue to make comments and statements in the appropriate way at the right time.  It will be open to any person who <Col N="28" /> wishes to enter the debate at any time to do likewise.  I have made my position clear as have the Government.  It is committed to putting the issue of divorce before the people in a referendum.  We had hoped to hold a referendum in 1994 but this may not be possible in view of the High Court challenge.  It will be put before the people for their decision at the earliest possible date.  The Government supports the concept that the total ban on divorce should be removed from the Constitution and will be recommending a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  There will be a debate in due course and I will be an active participant. I trust that Deputy Keogh and others will be strong advocates when the time comes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  13 and 14 together.  A comprehensive review of the law in relation to protection of persons from domestic violence has been completed in my Department taking into account recommendations contained in reports of the Law Reform Commission, the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Kilkenny incest investigation as well as consultations with groups such as Women's Aid.  Following on that review detailed proposals for reform of the law in this area, which have been prepared <Col N="29" /> in my Department, have recently been approved by the Government and a Bill is now being drafted as a matter of priority.  I envisage that the Bill will become law by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Present legislative provisions contained in the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981 apply only to situations of interspousal violence and violence against any children by either spouse.  The proposed new legislation will contain provisions to better protect those and other members of households, including parents, and it will deal also with cohabitants.  A new power of arrest in cases of domestic violence will be a feature of the legislation.  The full details will be announced in the normal way on publication of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There has been a delay in the drafting of this legislation.  As far back as last July it was announced that it would be prepared.  When I raised the matter here recently the Taoiseach stated that constitutional implications might be causing problems.

When the case went to court the judge stated that, &ldquo;if she is prepared to put up with this, there is nothing I can do&rdquo;.  When this legislation is enacted, will it still be up to the victim to ensure that the man is convicted in such cases or will the legislation ensure that the State cannot simply abandon a victim and not take action to punish a man who is clearly guilty of the offence of beating his wife on the street?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that there was a delay in the drafting of this legislation. The Programme for Government proposed that a measure of this nature would be introduced and indications were given from time to time that the heads of a Bill were being prepared.  It was only in the past couple of weeks that the measure was passed by the Government and instructions were sent to the Attorney General to draft the Bill.  It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to give specific details of the legislation.  The detail of the Bill will appear when it is published.  However, I can say that a new power of arrest will be provided for in cases of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>There is adequate criminal law legislation in place to deal with violence or assault causing bodily harm carried out by a husband or any other person.  Under existing legislation a spouse can also apply for a barring order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>At present only spouses are covered by barring orders.  The Minister indicated that cohabitees will be included and he subsequently stated that protection from adult children would be included.  Will he agree that in some cases siblings and other family relations can experience domestic violence which will not be covered under the Bill?  Why is he including only certain categories?  One of the main weaknesses of barring order legislation is that it prevents some people protecting themselves against domestic violence.  Why is the Minister perpetuating this by including some categories and excluding others?  Why will he not include a more general provision to protect siblings, cohabitees and other categories of people living together who can experience serious domestic violence?</P>

      <P>One million pounds has been included in this year's Estimate for my Department for childcare projects.</P>
      <P>The provision is intended to support the initiation of a limited number of projects for the establishment, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures, utilising the skills of trained local people to enable local residents to undertake education, training, re-training and employment opportunities to which they would otherwise be unable to aspire, in the absence of a child-minding facility.</P>
      <P>Grants will be directed towards funding initial start-up, capital expenditure such as the adaptation of premises, purchase of equipment, the cost of essential training, etc., associated with innovative childcare projects sponsored by community groups.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for consideration for grant assistance projects must be located in disadvantaged areas, as designated in the local development programme, and also involve partnerships between community groups and local employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have taken place at official level between the Departments which are already involved with area partnership companies in grant-aiding community <Col N="34" /> programmes to ensure effective interDepartmental co-ordination in the distribution of Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>Discussions are also well advanced regarding procedures for applications to ensure that these can be processed when the necessary financial approval becomes available on the passing of my Department's Estimate by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister announced the additional allocation for such projects in mid-March.  He did not indicate then that it would be restricted to the extended <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas.  Will they be the only areas to which the scheme will apply?  If that is so, he has merely given details of an existing scheme which is part and parcel of the extended <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area scheme.  People who live outside those areas will be excluded.  Will the Minister agree that there are many areas of rural poverty and isolation, and the people in those areas who would greatly benefit from such childcare projects will not have an opportunity to make their case?  His statement on the pilot scheme is not in keeping with his earlier one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether this is a new scheme, but an additional £1 million has been secured under the Department's 1994 Estimate for childcare projects.  This scheme was intended to be directed towards disadvantaged areas.  I would have thought that objective would have received Deputy McManus's support and that money should be directed where it is most needed, namely disadvantaged areas, rather than dissipated in well to do areas, which may not need State funding for this purpose.  Arrangements to allocate these moneys are well advanced.  Discussions with the area partnership companies are well progressed and the grant aiding arrangements will be put in place shortly. Application forms will issue on the passing of the Estimate for the Department by the Dáil, hopefully within the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued strongly that the money should be spent in disadvantaged areas, but I do not support the use of this blunt instrument.  Does the Minister recognise that drawing lines on a map is a blunt instrument which does not acknowledge the reality of the level of deprivation?  The position is complex and it is not sufficient to earmark certain areas of deprivation and ignore the rest, which effectively is what the Minister proposes.  I am sure applications have been submitted to the Minister which may not be covered under the national programme, but the people who live in those areas have a right to be considered along with those who live in other areas. The system could be compared with means testing and there is always someone who does not qualify under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I did not say <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas. I said the money should be directed towards disadvantaged areas.  An application received from a disadvantaged area will be eligible for a grant from the £1 million which the Government has made available for the pilot project.  I hope and expect it will greatly assist many disadvantaged communities in rural and urban areas.  People will not be excluded by reason of where they live.  The only qualification for eligibility is that the <Col N="36" /> application should be made by a disadvantaged area.

      <P>I invite the Minister while canvassing for the forthcoming election in Dublin South-Central to consider the disadvantaged areas of St. Theresa's Gardens, Dolphin House and Fatima Mansions with a view to setting up a pilot inter-parish scheme for those areas?  Will he agree that one of the best ways to tackle the issue of childcare is to provide decent housing?  Will he examine the report of the Lord Mayor's commission on housing, which I set up?  It was chaired by Dr. Garrett FitzGerald and included a cross section of politicians and other members of the public with a view to introducing equality into the allocation of housing for those living in inner city flat complexes.</P>

The Government has allocated additional funds for housing and has provided for the building of more houses this year than for many years.  The houses are of good quality, which is more than can be said of many houses built in the past.  Like Deputy Mitchell, I have been happy to participate in canvassing in the Dublin South-Central constituency and I assure him that any application I receive from the areas he mentioned or other disadvantaged areas will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the term &ldquo;enduring power of attorney&ldquo;?  I certainly welcome his proposal to introduce a Bill; that was the central objective of my question, but will the Minister agree that Alzheimer's disease is not a mental illness?  Will he further agree that the question of how to treat people with that disease and those of advanced age needs to be addressed urgently?  When does he intend to introduce this legislation and how long does he think it will be before it becomes law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not qualified to say whether Alzheimer's disease is a mental illness.  I would have thought it was.  An ordinary power of attorney is revoked if the person who granted it subsequently suffers a mental incapacity, gets married or goes bankrupt.  That can have serious implications for the administration of the affairs of that person as the attorney would no longer be in a position to see to them.  At present there is no provision in law under which a power of attorney could be given that would continue in force in the event of the mental incapacity of the person who granted it.  It would require legislation to achieve that and it is being worked on in my Department.  It seems straightforward, there is a basic simplicity to it in one sense, but caution is necessary because an enduring power of attorney could be open to the exploitation of the interests of the person who suffered the mental incapacity or, perhaps, an elderly person who is no longer capable of managing his or her own affairs.  The position of the attorney, the person who is given the power, is very powerful.  That person would have access to all the property and assets of the grantor, the person who granted the power. The attorney could take into his own hands all the assets and property of that <Col N="38" /> person.  Care must be taken, therefore, to include safeguards in the system when it is set up which can be done by a registration system or other checking procedure. It is a matter that requires some degree of care.  The object of this exercise, the authorisation of that kind of instrument, has my full support.  I am not in a position to say exactly when it will be introduced in the House, but I intend to do so as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>People involved with Alzheimer's sufferers would not wish to have it described as a mental illness. However, I know the Minister does not intend any slight.  It is a physical illness which affects the brain.  There is a distinction. In any event, I intend to raise this with the Minister for Health as neither the Minister nor I are medically qualified.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider introducing this legislation in the current session?  Is it likely that the Bill will pass before the summer recess?  Alternatively, will he introduce it before the summer recess so that it can be in committee during the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not intend any slur on people with Alzheimer's disease. As to whether it is regarded as a physical or mental condition, I am not qualified to say.  However, it is clearly a case where an enduring power of attorney would be called into play.  I had a meeting some time ago with the association at which representations were made to me for the introduction of legislation that would enable enduring powers of attorney to be entered into.</P>
      <P>As to when the legislation will be introduced, I am always reluctant to give a commitment on specific timings for the introduction of legislation because, more often than not, these are matters outside my control.  They depend on so many other people, including officials, the Attorney General and so on and on time availability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which had its inaugural meeting on 8 December 1993, has been meeting regularly since then and has established six working groups to examine, in detail, important aspects affecting the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The issues being dealt with by the working groups are as follows: education; working-training; family and personal supports; income support; housing-accommodation and consultative processes.</P>
      <P>On 17 May 1994, on behalf of the Commission, I launched a major innovative and nationwide consultation process involving people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The first element of this process is a leaflet, which will be widely distributed, inviting people with disabilities and those concerned about disability issues to send a letter, tape or computer disk by 31 August, outlining their ideas about making Ireland a better place for people with disabilities.  The suggested issues include employment, justice, rights, allowances, culture, etc.  This leaflet is available in print, tape and computer disk.</P>
      <P>The Commission is also arranging a series of &ldquo;listening&rdquo; sessions at which people with disabilities, their families and other interested groups and individuals may make their views known.  Among the venues planned for June are Sligo, Tralee, Athlone and Kilkenny.  Further listening sessions in other venues throughout the country will be arranged at later dates.</P>
      <P>Work on facilitating the establishment of a Council on the Status of People with Disabilities is well under way in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister responsible for promoting equal treatment for people with <Col N="40" /> disabilities, I have been actively reviewing implementation of current Government policy in relation to their employment to see what further improvements can be secured.</P>
    <P>A very important element of Government policy in respect of the employment of people with disabilities is the commitment to achieve a quota of 3 per cent in the public service.  This commitment has been renewed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The percentage of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has now reached 3 per cent of total staff numbers.  I am continuing my effort to achieve similar progress elsewhere in the public sector.</P>
    <P>In his Financial Statement on 26 January 1994, the Minister for Finance announced funding for a number of projects aimed at improving the situation of people with disabilities.  In that connection, £500,000 is being provided through the Department of the Environment towards pilot projects aimed at improving access for people with disabilities, especially those using wheelchairs, to public parks and other recreational facilities and amenities which lack such access at present.  An allocation of £100,000 has been provided through the Department of Health to assist voluntary organisations to improve vehicles used for transporting people with disabilities, to services and facilities. This expenditure will be planned jointly between the Department of Health and my Department.  The Government is also providing £2 million in 1994 for a pilot programme for sheltered employment of people with disabilities in viable business projects.  This programme will be undertaken by the Department of Health in consultation with the Rehabilitation Institute and other interested groups.  My Department is also involved in the planning of this programme.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the foregoing brief account that significant progress is being made, at a practical level, to eliminate inequalities in the treatment of people with disabilities.  This progress will be supplemented later this year by the introduction of anti-discrimination legislation <Col N="41" /> which will apply to various groups, including people with disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the progress made at Commission level and I compliment all those involved with it who are providing a great public service. I will focus on one area for which the Minister has direct responsibility, public service employment.  What would the Minister's reaction be to increasing the 3 per cent Civil Service quota to 5 per cent?  On the broader public service, will the Minister give an indication of the percentage of disabled people employed there and whether progress has been made in recent times in increasing numbers in that area?  Has an approach been made to the various local authorities of the Local Appointments Commission to ensure that they increase the number of disabled people employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gratified that after many years we have finally succeeded in achieving the minimum quota of 3 per cent employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service, that figure has only recently been achieved.  I do not regard that as the end of the story; I am anxious that further progress is made in the Civil Service.  I have indicated, and will continue to indicate to my colleagues, that that figure should be regarded as a baseline in future and I hope it will be possible to secure a higher figure, without wishing to set any further quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the wider public service the position is far from satisfactory.  I do not have the figures for local authorities and so on but if Deputy O'Keeffe puts down a question I will get that information for him.  The number of disabled people employed in that area is well below that for the Civil Service.  My Department is in communication with managers of local authorities and the wider public service to see what can be done in that regard. Employment equality legislation, in the course of preparation, will have a bearing on anti-discrimination in employment in <Col N="42" /> the public sector generally and in the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister redouble his efforts to encourage the broader public service, particularly local authorities, to increase the number of disabled employees?  Continued encouragement from the Minister is necessary since progress is not being made.  To return to the Civil Service quota, will the Minister accept that the Civil Service quota of 3 per cent is the headline quota and regarded as a national aspiration? Unless the Minister sets a higher percentage, that will be regarded as the optimum figure rather than the baseline.  I encourage the Minister to consider the possibility of a 5 per cent quota in the Civil Service rather than merely making aspirational phrases in favour of a figure higher than 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will carefully consider the Deputy's suggestion and, if necessary, it may be implemented.  The 3 per cent quota figure was adopted by the Government as far back as, I think, 1977 &mdash; I may be wrong about this &mdash; and all Governments since then, despite their best efforts, failed to achieve that target. This year for the first time, as a result of a very major effort, the figure was achieved.  I was reluctant to strongly take to task the wider public service until that baseline had been achieved.  Otherwise we would have been open to the suggestion that our own house should be put in order first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the basic figure has been achieved I expect the wider public service, particularly local authorities, to achieve the figure of 3 per cent.  I have asked them to do so and I repeat that call now.  I would prefer them to achieve that figure on a voluntary basis, without having to use strong arm tactics. However, if within a reasonable length of time I am not satisfied that steps are being taken to increase the percentage of people with disabilities employed in these organisations, I will seriously consider introducing legislation to compel that to <Col N="43" /> be done.  If that should prove necessary I would have no hesitation in doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The very strong words used by the Minister tempt me to say that the pot is calling the kettle black because it was only recently that the Civil Service achieved the 3 per cent figure.  By using such strong words and talking in terms of compulsion, some people would say the Minister has changed his tune in a very short time.  Will he agree that the record of local government is so bad in this respect &mdash; the Minister pulled a figure out of the blue, 0.7 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Currie.  The Civil Service and the Government have shown that a target figure of 3 per cent can be achieved if they put their minds to it.  If such a commitment is made in the wider public service &mdash; it has a responsibility in that regard &mdash; it can be achieved.  I will continue to put pressure on that area to substantially boost the number of disabled people employed and if I am not satisfied that reasonable efforts are being made to this end I will consider the alternatives open to me.  I am most anxious to achieve progress in this regard and the legislation, which will be very helpful, will apply to the public sector as well as the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I already acknowledged the Minister's commitment to Government policy in this area.  To achieve the target will take more than moral persuasion.  It has taken the Civil Service so long to achieve the measly figure of 3 per cent employment of disabled people that we cannot allow the public service generally to wait much longer before it achieves the target.  Perhaps the Minister will consider <Col N="44" /> anti-discrimination legislation later in the year.  Will he say whether the legislation will cover access of people with a disability to places such as public houses and so on?</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention that people with a disability have been barred from public houses in my constituency because of the attitude of the management and staff.  That is regrettable and I hope this problem will be addressed in the new anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>For obvious reasons I cannot go into the precise detail of what will be contained in the legislation but, in broad terms, the issue of access will be included.  This can be discussed in more detail on Committee Stage.  I agree with Deputy Keogh's general comments.  I hope and expect that those in the wider public service will now take on board the fact that the Civil Service has achieved the 3 per cent quota.  I would point out to them, if they are not already aware, that the NRB provides an excellent assistance and guidance service to all companies, semi-State or private, interested in employing a person with a disability. It provides a list of people who can do all types of jobs equally well as an able bodied person and provides an excellent advisory and supply service.  Any organisation wishing to make progress in the expansion of provision of employment for people with disabilities should avail of the service, provided on a skilled and professional basis, by the NRB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister carried out an assessment in respect of local authority offices where these people will be employed and has he any idea whether these premises allow access for disabled people?  Before employing disabled people one must consider whether they can get into the building, I wonder if the Minister has considered this question because many local authority offices are housed in old buildings.  Has the Minister made any serious attempt to ensure that access to council buildings, where it is prevented at present, will be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> In relation to local authority employment, will the Minister consider lobbying for an expansion of the workforce at local authority level since many local authorities find that due to cutbacks in the past, the amount of work they can do is limited?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of access generally will be considered in the context of the legislation and that will be progressed by my Department as quickly as possible.  I have not carried out a survey, nor do I have the resources to do so, of all local authority and public service offices but the question of accessibility will be dealt with in the forthcoming legislation.  New constructions are covered by the planning Acts and local authorities are required to ensure that the question of access is addressed on new planning applications for appropriate buildings which is to be commended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The grant-in-aid of £5 million which I have secured from the Government for the Legal Aid Board for 1994 will enable the board to open ten new full time law centres and four new part-time law centres this year.  Arrangements are being made by the board to begin opening new centres in the next few weeks.  By the end of the year there will be 26 full time and 17 part-time law centres and every county will have either a full-time or part-time law centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing resources of the Legal Aid Board have also been substantially increased since I took over responsibility <Col N="47" /> for legal aid.  In 1993, the number of solicitors was increased by 12 and the number of support staff by 29.  By the end of this year a further 24 solicitors and 34 support staff will have been recruited which will bring the total complement of staff employed by the board to 178, i.e. 75 solicitors and 103 support staff &mdash; an increase of over 100 per cent since early last year.</P>
    <P>I also introduced last year a pilot project for the involvement of private solicitors in the provision, in certain circumstances, of legal services for the board.  This project, which in Dublin operates from Aston House, is confined to the conduct of cases for maintenance, barring and custody orders in the District Court.  It operates nationwide and enables the making of arrangements by law centres with local private solicitors to provide a direct service to clients.  The effectiveness of the project is being reviewed in the overall context of the board's development plant.</P>
    <P>The additional staff recruited last year, as well as the use of private solicitors, has already resulted in significant reductions in waiting lists.  An indication of the success of these developments is that the numbers on the waiting lists in the various law centres have been almost halved since commencement of the development programme nine months ago.  Waiting time in 12 of the board's current 16 law centres is four months or under.  In three centres it is between seven and eight months and in one centre it is ten months. This compares well with the position in the law centres some nine months ago when only six of the centres were in the &ldquo;four months or under category&rdquo;, while legal aid applicants at seven centres had to wait ten or more months for a first appointment with solicitor.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree that the developments I have outlined are a good indication of my determination and that of the Government to ensure access to the courts.</P>

      <P>We acknowledge that waiting lists have been reduced and we are grateful.  It is unclear from the Minister's reply whether it is intended to continue with the pilot scheme.  In regard to the solicitors involved in the scheme and the new centres, is the Minister satisfied that they have the requisite experience because some concern has been expressed by a number of groups that the solicitors involved in the new centres may not have the necessary familiarity with the whole area of family law which they feel is required?  These groups need a reassurance from the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <P>I cannot give an assurance about any solicitor but 140 solicitors participate in the scheme and even those who had little experience when they began have certainly gained it now. Private solicitors dealt with 457 cases which were sent to them from the Aston Quay centre in Dublin.  Clearly they will gain a degree of professionalism in dealing with family law cases if they do not have it already.  They are all qualified professional people.  The scheme seems to be a worthwhile one which has substantial <Col N="49" /> support from solicitors.  It will be reviewed by my Department shortly and consideration will then be given to continuing it or making variations to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have condemned all terrorist acts irrespective of where, by whom or against whom they have been perpetrated.  Likewise, the Government condemns last Saturday night's brutal UVF attack on a crowded public house in Dublin as a further act of mindless savagery of the kind which has deprived the communities on this island of the opportunity to live together in peace and harmony.  The Government rejects any purported justification of this attack whether it was carried out in the pursuit of political ends or as a response to the violence of opposing paramilitary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent upsurge in paramilitary violence, which claimed the life of Mr. Martin Doherty in last Saturday night's attack, has claimed 32 other lives in Northern Ireland so far this year.  I extend the sympathy of the Government to all the families who have suffered bereavement and also to those who have been injured as a result of this violence.  The <Col N="51" /> Government is determined to continue to work for an end to such violence so that other families will not have to endure the personal tragedy and loss which these families are now going through.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the particulars of last Saturday night's attack I must acknowledge that the Garda Síochána and the RUC have been alert to the possibility of a loyalist attack of this kind for some time and they have continually reviewed and updated their security arrangements in order to guard against any such attempt.  However, as the tragic events of the past 25 years have demonstrated, it is not possible for the security forces to guarantee that each and every attack can be prevented.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána have constantly monitored the terrorist threat to the State and taken all reasonable measures commensurate with the varying levels of threat which have pertained at different times.</P>
    <P>As to the attack itself I am informed by the Garda Síochána that at approximately 10.50 p.m. on Saturday, three men pulled up in the car outside the Widow Scallans public house in Pearse Street.  Two of the men got out of the car and went into the foyer of the pub.  On being challenged there, they fled the premises and, in so doing, fired a number of shots.  Mr. Martin Doherty was killed in the gunfire and Mr. Paddy Burke received injuries to his neck and chest.</P>
    <P>The Garda and emergency services were on the scene within minutes and while the victims were being attended to, a small explosion went off in a hold-all bag at the doorway of the public house. Subsequent examination of this bag revealed that it contained a quantity of commercial explosive which had been primed to go off.  My understanding is that had the contents of the bag exploded as intended, many, if not all, of those in and outside the public house at the time would have been killed or injured.</P>
    <P>The priorities of the Government and the Garda Síochána in the follow-up to this savage attack are to bring those who perpetrated it to justice and to ensure <Col N="52" /> that all possible steps are taken to prevent a further attack of this kind.  Yesterday, the Tánaiste and I took the opportunity to discuss the attack with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the occasion of the opening of the Shannon-Erne waterway.  I received his assurance that the full co-operation of the RUC is being afforded to the gardaí in their investigation and that the current excellent level of security co-operation between both forces will be maintained and, where possible, enhanced in the ongoing effort to prevent terrorist outrages on both sides of the border.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, I met the Garda Commissioner to review the progress of the Garda investigation into Saturday night's attack and the extent and appropriateness of the security measures in place to prevent a recurrence.  It would not be appropriate for me to detail the Garda efforts in these respects.  I am satisfied that all necessary action is being taken by the Garda authorities on both fronts as a matter of urgency.  I assure the House that the measures being taken by the Garda Síochána to prevent further loyalist attacks on the community are both extensive and comprehensive.  They involve a combination of Garda operational measures, co-operation with the business community and close and constant contact with the RUC authorities. These measures will continue to be kept under review at a senior level in Garda headquarters.</P>
    <P>Saturday night's incident was a most serious one.  The perpetrators had clearly intended to cause death and injury on a much larger scale.  Their actions have caused many people in Dublin and elsewhere to be fearful for their personal safety.  By way of reassurance to all concerned. I would point out that the security forces remain vigilant and alert to the terrorist threat and they will take &mdash; and they have the resources to take &mdash; whatever measures they deem necessary to meet it.  The right course for the public at large is not to succumb to excessive fear or panic but rather to exercise a reasonable degree of care and vigilance in going about their normal business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept there is general public disquiet that the Garda Síochána is completely under strength and not in a position to deal effectively with an emergency in Dublin? It cannot cope with the serious crime problem in the capital city, never mind a loyalist bombing campaign.  Does she accept that the Garda urgently needs to be brought up to strength?  Is it a fact that, despite repeated warnings by the RUC chief constable and others and the previous planting of a bomb in Dublin, there was no overall contingency plan put into operation in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's attempted bombing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the allegations that the Garda cannot cope with the situation they faced last Saturday night or with general crime in Dublin and that they are under strength.  Last December, following the recommendation by the Garda Commissioner that the strength of the force be maintained at 11,000 men and women, I got the approval of the Government for a package of £66 million which included the recruitment of 407 gardaí this year and 350 new recruits each year from 1995 until 1997 to maintain strength at what the Garda Commissioner thinks is the appropriate level.  The second part of the Deputy's supplementary is not appropriate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of warnings from the RUC, it is no secret that for some time the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir Hugh Annesley, has been saying at all the Anglo-Irish Conference meetings and restricted security sessions that it was not a question of if but when such an attack might take place in some part of the Republic.  As a result, security measures were stepped up considerably by the Garda in co-operation with the RUC. It has been acknowledged publicly on a number of occasions by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and by the Minister for Security, Sir John Wheeler, that the level of security co-operation between the Garda and the RUC has never been better and the level of intelligence gathering the Garda get through <Col N="54" /> the RUC and <i>vice versa</i> has never been at a higher level.  This will continue to be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the warnings given by the RUC chief constable were repeatedly talked down by Government spokespersons, apparently in an attempt to reassure the public, and that those warnings were not taken seriously?  If they were taken seriously why was it possible for this car to be driven through the city of Dublin, be identified by the Garda and be used in the planting of a bomb?  Arising from her discussions during the past two days, does the Minister have reason to believe that the RUC will be successful in apprehending those who were responsible for the outrage on Saturday night and, if so, will this State seek their extradition so that they can stand trial here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Every warning given by the RUC is taken extremely seriously both by the Government and the Garda.  The high level of security co-operation and intelligence gathering co-operation between the Garda and the RUC has been acknowledged publicly.</P>
      <P>I want to deal in particular with the second part of the Deputy's supplementary as this has raised a number of issues in the newspapers during the past 24 hours.  The car in question was seen in Dublin by uniformed gardaí earlier on the evening of the attack.  It was immediately checked with the RUC but the computer records did not show a very recent change of ownership of the car, which had been purchased in Lisburn, County Antrim, the day before the attack by a man who gave a false name and address.  This meant, in effect, that there was no reason to suspect that the car was being used other than for a legitimate purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Northern Ireland cars generally and the possibility of such cars entering the State quite freely, if one looks at Dublin city and my city one can see that in recent months, particularly during the past three or four months, there has been a huge increase in the <Col N="55" /> number of Northern Ireland registered cars coming here.  While this is a very welcome development, it poses difficulties. Gardaí are faced with making a decision to stop and search all Northern Ireland registered cars, regardless of the Border crossing they used to enter the State.  I think Deputy Gilmore would agree that this would create chaos.  They have to rely on their intelligence and the intelligence of the RUC in regard to suspect cars which might be travelling into the South.  The level of co-operation has never been higher.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if I hoped the RUC would be able to apprehend those who were responsible for this outrage.  Of course, I hope it can apprehend these people.  It has descriptions of the people seen in the car, which have been made available by the Garda, and evidence available on its own side about the movements of the car.  A special investigation unit has been set up to deal specifically with this crime and if and when people are apprehended of course the State will seek their extradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the level of co-operation between the Garda and the RUC and the assurance given by the Secretary of State that there will be full co-operation by the RUC. Will she confirm that the Garda will also have the full support of the Government in its attempts to obtain the resources it needs to deal with the crime problem generally and terrorist attacks in particular so as to defend life, limb and property? The Garda has laughable resources compared to those of the RUC and these should have been increased at a time when the chief constable of the RUC was giving public warnings of the possibility of this type of attack south of the Border. Has the Minister considered calling up retired gardaí to fill the existing 500 vacancies while additional gardaí are being recruited over the next 18 months or two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the public warnings by the chief constable of the RUC, what extra steps were taken in regard to security?  The <Col N="56" /> same night there was a Billy Joel concert in Dublin which was attended by many people from Northern Ireland.  Were extra security measures put in place that night?  Will the Minister give an assurance that she will give the Garda Commissioner and the Garda the same level of co-operation they get from the RUC and provide the resources necessary to defend this country and its institutions, restore law and order and prevent similar attacks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the implication in the Deputy's question that the Garda Commissioner and Garda Síochána are not getting full co-operation and support from the Government.  I said in my initial response that the Garda has and will have the resources necessary to deal with the threat posed by terrorist attacks such as the one which occurred last Saturday night.  At a time when stringent financial constraints are being implemented by the Government, I secured, with the support and help of the Government, a package of £66 million over and above the Department of Justice Estimate.  This proves beyond any doubt that the Government is serious about providing the resources, equipment, etc. required by the Garda Síochána to tackle ordinary crime and the ever-present threat of terrorist violence such as we saw last Saturday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of her discussions during the past few days, has the Minister reassessed her view of the number of gardaí necessary in Dublin? The gardaí working in Dublin at present are under severe pressure.  It is possible in situations such as this for a climate of fear to develop.  Nevertheless it is important that people appreciate the dangers which exist and potential threats.  What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that there is what I would term a knowledgeable state of alertness among the public, not unjustified fear?  Does she have the resources to ensure that the appropriate message is given to the public in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of alerting the public, the very successful neighbourhood watch scheme has brought gardaí into direct contact with communities throughout Dublin city.  In addition, a business watch scheme was launched recently.  This scheme was introduced mainly at the request of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the City Centre Business Association which felt that the Garda should give priority to supporting and encouraging businesses and recognising what they can do in terms of being vigilant about their property. The resources available to support that kind of effort have been increased this year.</P>
      <P>I do not have the exact number of gardaí stationed in Dublin but it is well over 3,000, approximately 37 per cent of the total Garda force.  The number of gardaí on the streets in Dublin was increased as a result of the Government's support for the civilianisation of the force which was put forward by the Garda Commissioner.  That programme of civilianisation ensures that gardaí who to date were desk-bound have been released by degrees on the streets to engage in the type of operational duty for which they were expensively trained by the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister's reassessment of State security include any measure to restrict or even prohibit the Provisional IRA organising functions in the city of Dublin, or anywhere else in the State because, as they are advertised in Provisional IRA booklets in the North, they pose a significant risk to life and limb of the citizens of Dublin and elsewhere? Will the Minister ask the Garda to oppose the renewal of licences for premises used by subversives to raise money for their evil activities?</P>

The Garda have taken the initiative and are vigilant when such licences come up for renewal in the courts.  I assure Deputy O'Donnell that the Garda intend to continue that type of vigilance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One gets the impression listening to the Minister that basically she is satisfied with the security arrangements. If so, does she agree with the Tánaiste who suggested on Sunday evening that there should be, in his words, a complete review of security? Will the Minister say whether that took place within the past 24 hours, or whether she has satisfied herself that there is no need for it?  Is she concerned that Garda strength is 500 under the authorised number?  With additional retirements from the Garda Síochána in the coming months as a result of new pension arrangements &mdash; which many had been waiting to avail of, and which are now in place &mdash; does she recognise that there is a lead-in time for further recruits to the force because of the very laudable provision for additional training and that the likelihood is, in the short term, that Garda numbers will fall?  Will the Minister agree that if Garda resources are to be reallocated to the surveillance of potential subversives on this side of the Border, it means that the protection of citizens against conventional crime will be reduced, as no member of the force <Col N="59" /> can be in two different places at the same time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday that the review of security arrangments had already begun.  That review is being undertaken by the Garda Commissioner, most particularly the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility in the crime and security area.  I met both those gentlemen this morning who gave me a full updated briefing on the events of last Saturday and on the various security measures being stepped up as part of that review.  In relation to a special review, I should say that, as always, in every police force worldwide, there is continuous review of all the measures they take against crime, most particularly in this State against terrorist crime.  That forms part of a continuous review procedure between the Garda and the RUC, which I am sure is how Members of this House would like to see such co-operation develop.</P>
      <P>I am thankful for Deputy John Bruton's appreciation of the fact that, at a time of financial stringency, we succeeded in getting the extra money required for new recruits to the force and I accept his point that there is a lead-in time.  When this matter was discussed with the Garda Commissioner he was strongly of the view that the retirement age of gardaí should be maintained at 57, the current retirement age, and was not supportive of an increase in that limit. An increase would be required if we did as Deputies Mitchell and Bruton suggested, which is that members of the Garda would not be required to retire at age 57 or indeed that members who had already retired at age 57 might well be called back in the lead-up period.  I do not have any proposals in relation to that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say specifically whether a contingency plan was put into operation following the bomb attack last Saturday night?  Will she confirm that the same organisation, less than a year ago, planted a bomb in a <Col N="60" /> Telecom communications installation right beside Store Street Garda Station, not very far from where the car used in Saturday night's attack was found burned out; that this has given rise to concerns that members of that gang may already be based in Dublin?  Does she agree that it is now all the more urgent, to allay public disquiet, that the Garda report and investigation into the 1974 car bombings in Dublin is published and action taken against those involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last part of the Deputy's question, as he knows, I am very far advanced with the report into the bombings, it is with the Garda Commissioner at present.  As soon as it is returned to me I intend to seek the co-operation of the Whips to allow us to debate it in this House.</P>
      <P>Of course the Garda has a contingency plan.  I do not think any former Minister for Justice in this House, or publicly outside it, ever said what that contingency plan is, nor do I intend to depart from that practice because it is a security matter.  Indeed it would be very much in the interests of the paramilitaries and the terrorist organisations if the contingency plan or security measures the Garda might take over a period of time to deal with terrorist organisations were published. I said yesterday that Northern Ireland is the most policed part of western Europe.  However, even where there is a supposed ring of steel around Belfast determined men of violence can penetrate it, plant a bomb and get away. Therefore, it is not fair to imply that the Garda have not been capable of securing this State, or its towns and villages against the possibility of a terrorist attack.  It is ever vigilant; there is the highest degree of security co-operation between it and the RUC.  They depend on one another for the high level of intelligence now available and I want that to continue.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, I hope he will accept that it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to comment on specific security or surveillance measures that may be in operation at any given time.  I do not intend to depart from that practice.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the logical conclusion to be drawn from her comments that the numbers of troops and RUC in Northern Ireland involved in this ring of steel which she argues has not prevented bombs going off there, is that if we reduced Garda numbers by 5,000, it would not make any difference?  Surely the Minister should be able to inform the House that the figure of 11,000 she agreed with the Garda Commissioner is the basic minimum that should be available in defending the State against the activities of subversives and others?  Following the warnings given by the RUC Chief Constable which he gave publicly &mdash; I wonder if he did so for some reason &mdash; will the Minister specifically inform the House what extra steps the Government took to protect people south of the Border?</P>
      <P>Lastly, since it is very clear that there were members of the IRA at that function last Saturday night, will the Minister say whether any of the organisers of the event have been questioned about being members of an illegal organisation whose objective is to bring down the State?</P>

      <P>I do not have specific information in relation to the final part of the Deputy's question.  On Garda strength the recommendation made to me by the Garda Commissioner <Col N="62" /> was that the strength of the force should be 11,000.  Deputy Mitchell and a number of Government Deputies raised the question of an extension of the retirement age of gardaí from 57 to 60 on the basis of the lead-in period required for recruits.  I put that to the Garda Commissioner who opposed such an extension and I accepted that recommendation.</P>
      <P>On what steps were taken as a result of the warnings given by the Chief Constable of the RUC, the security measures being taken by the Garda Síochána since the warnings include the manning of static and mobile checkpoints at the Border and elsewhere in the State.  The Garda authorities see much greater benefit in mobile checkpoints which carry an element of surprise for those involved in terrorist type offences.  There has been a significant increase in traffic from Northern Ireland to this part of the country in the past four or five months and while that brings an added economic advantage to this part of the island, it creates difficulties for the Garda in relation to operational matters.  The essential point is that the level of security co-operation between the RUC and the Garda has never been better and that will continue.  If there are areas where the Garda Síochána need more resources they will be made available to them by the Government.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to reassess her view in relation to Garda strength.  Every survey carried out in Dublin shows that the public view is that the Garda is under resourced to deal with the complaints being made.  People are satisfied with the initial follow-up to crime but not with the ongoing contact they have with the Garda.</P>

      <P>On Garda operational matters, Garda strength and Garda presence on the street, there are three ways of tackling those issues.  First, to recruit extra gardaí &mdash; which we are doing &mdash; and, second, by extending the civilianisation programme so that we do not have gardaí sitting behind desks or answering telephone calls in Garda <Col N="63" /> stations when they could be more usefully employed on the streets.  The civilianisation programme has been extremely successful and is continuing apace because there is Government support for it.  Third, I hope in the autumn to introduce legislation to deal with the excessive amount of time that large numbers of gardaí spend in our courts on a daily basis waiting for cases to be called. The only way that can be changed is by legislation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the preliminary Garda report into the outrage on Saturday did not include any investigation by the Garda into the organisers of the event and that there has been no interrogation of those who organised the event?  Does this mean that the Garda are turning a blind eye to the fact that the Provisional IRA is organising events in Dublin city?  Is the Government, as well as pandering to the Provisional IRA in the North, now pandering to it here?</P>

      <P>I reject the allegation that this Government is in any way pandering to a terrorist organisation such as the Provisional IRA, either here or in Northern Ireland.  Any investigation of the organisers is a matter for the Garda and if and when they have evidence to suggest that members of a certain organisation were involved in organising the event they will not be slow in coming forward and taking whatever action is necessary.  That was not part of the discussion I had with either the Garda Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner this morning.  We confined our discussion to the measures taken prior to the event, the event itself, the measures adopted since and what Government support is necessary for the Garda.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions in regard to surveillance of movements of known loyalist terrorists on both sides of the Border.  Is the Minister satisfied that the RUC is engaging in sufficient surveillance <Col N="64" /> of known members of the mid-Ulster cell of the UVF which apparently is responsible for this event?  Is information from the RUC passed on quickly enough to the Garda Síochána to ensure that if such members are absent from their usual haunts in Northern Ireland that there will be a special alert for them if they appear on this side of the Border?  In that context is the Minister satisfied with a situation where apparently a significant portion of the surveillance along the Border by the Garda is undertaken by uniformed, unarmed gardaí on their own in a patrol car?  Is she satisfied that one person unarmed patrols are sufficient for dealing with these utterly ruthless killers who are willing to cross the Border to kill indiscriminately on this side of the Border?  Is the Minister satisfied that the resources are available to put a sufficient number of gardaí in place to ensure that the information and surveillance is sufficiently close so that none of these people can move out of their normal haunts without it being known to the security forces reasonably quickly on both sides of the Border?</P>

      <P>There is a mix of security measures in place.  I would not like anybody to think that was the only level of security of surveillance.  I reassured the Garda Commissioner this morning on any extra resources which may be necessary in this area of operation and that the Government would not be found wanting in providing those resources.  He has reassured me that he and the Garda have sufficient resources to deal with this problem.  In reply to Deputy Bruton's question as to whether the RUC are engaging in sufficient surveillance of the UVF, I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that they are <Col N="65" /> and that that information is passed to the Garda in relation to known members of terrorist organisations, most particularly loyalist terrorist organisations, who may be leaving their normal place of activity and proceeding south.  That information is immediately passed by the divisional commander of the RUC to the Garda who, in turn, are able to follow those individuals.  There is a special alert system when such people move from one part of the country to the other.</P>

Will she also remember that the UVF, UFF or any other group will not operate under the same rules as the IRA in relation to attacks on the security forces in this jurisdiction?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the curtain fell on my contribution some weeks ago I outlined in detail why I had reservations about the content of the Bill.  The final point I want to make has been touched on by Deputies from all over the country, namely, the matter of a headquarters for An Bord Bia.  Deputies from Malin Head to Mizen Head staked a claim for the location of the headquarters of An Bord Bia in their area.  The location of the headquarters is not a question of political patronage but of logic.  The decision by the Government and the Minister to rule out Cork as a location defies logic.  Munster is the centre of agricultural production. More food is produced and processed in Munster than in any other region and Cork is its capital.  Most of the major players in the food industry, such as Kerry Co-op, Dairygold, Golden Vale, Avonmore and Waterford Foods are located in the Munster area and that, together with the range of meat processing plants and other food processing facilities located in the Munster region, makes a strong case for the location of the headquarters of An Bord Bia in the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable investment <Col N="161" /> in technology and personnel in University College Cork and in Moore Park, both of which are internationally recognised for their contribution to the development of the food industry.  When one considers such investment and the significant players to which I referred, it defies logic that the Government should turn its back on Cork as a centre for the headquarters of An Bord Bia.  The biotechnology centre in UCC is a significant contributor to developments in the food industry and the faculties of dairy and meat science at UCC are long established and have produced excellent scientists and contributors to the food industry, not only here but throughout Europe and the world.  The academic excellence of those faculties offers a significant advantage for Cork as a location for the headquarters.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the costs of decentralising the headquarters from Dublin would be too high does not hold water. The Department of Education was decentralised to Athlone, the Department of Social Welfare to Sligo, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to Cavan and Portlaoise and the Department of the Environment to Mayo.  If the Government does not lead by example in terms of decentralisation, how can we expect economic policy to counter the enormous disadvantages suffered by the regions compared with Dublin in attracting industrial investment and generating jobs?</P>
    <P>The location of the headquarters is a question of logic and for the reasons I have outlined the Government should seriously reconsider its decision not to locate the headquarters in Cork.  It is regrettable that the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have missed the opportunity to serve the agricultural industry and encourage its potential for employment and export earnings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and, in particular, I welcome the Minister's comments concerning a greater degree of unity in the activities of State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> In other member states of the European Union single agencies have been successful in food promotion and market development.  It is fitting we should adopt the unified approach called for by the Minister in this area.  I hope the new agency will draw up a plan in this regard which will be kept under review by the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department of Agriculture.  With the exception of the work done by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, An Bord Bia will be responsible for the promotion and market development of our food and drink products.</P>
    <P>Section 7 includes beverages under the description of food.  It also includes livestock. The promotion of livestock is a relatively minor activity of CBF.  There seems to be a campaign against live cattle export and it is regrettable that campaign has been so strong in recent times.  Many farmers and producers have been enthusiastic about opening up the live cattle export market.  Much time and effort has been spent by Ministers and Department officials to win back the live trade.  We have important markets in Iran, Egypt and the Middle East.  Our products have been successful in those markets because of their high quality and the disease free status of our herd.  It appears that much of the good work of Departments and Ministers has been jeopardised by the campaign against live cattle exports.  There is a world market for our products and we should avail of it.  We realise the cushion of intervention is fast disappearing and our farming community is anxious to serve the world market.</P>
    <P>I have argued there should be a balance between live trade and factory trade and I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will continue to ensure such a balance is struck.  Reports of cruelty in the export of livestock should be investigated. Unemployment and lay offs in both market areas have been mentioned. Measures should be put in place to ensure necessary standards so that agricultural employment is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister's achievement in the allocation of the additional milk quota for <Col N="163" /> small scale producers was remarkable.  I understand he secured 6 million gallons under the scheme.  The extra allocation of 1.1 million gallons to the west, north and north east has been welcomed by farmers in those areas.  The scheme is designed to assist farmers in the west and north serving co-operatives in those areas.  However, farmers in the south Galway area who supply a co-operative in the south do not qualify for the increased milk quota.  In a press statement on 16 March the Minister said the additional quota would help to offset losses of quota which Connacht-Ulster has suffered in the past and will strengthen the structure of the industry both at farmer and processor level.  South Galway is in the Connacht-Ulster area.  The same assistance should be provided to farmers in south Galway as is provided to others.  South Galway farmers supply Nenagh co-operative, but because of the anomaly they do not qualify for the increased quota.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Upton's comment that political lobbying on behalf of farmers is a declining force. However, I agree with his comment that he does not see a conflict between the concerns of farmers and consumer. Senator Feargal Quinn made that point also.  Farmers must produce what the consumers want.  If not, such products will be imported.  I hope this area will be researched and developed.  We have good quality food and our high standards should be maintained.</P>
    <P>In the past scares have been raised about the quality of our food.  I recall scares some years ago about the quality of our milk which caused shopkeepers to display signs that the milk for sale was free of hormones.  Similar scares have been raised about our meat products recently.  I commend the Minister for his decisive action on the matter of beef exports to Germany.  The German market is an important one.  It was not merely a question of the German authorities imposing a ban on our beef exports; it involved a link between Irish beef and consumers' health.  That matter has been handled in an appropriate way <Col N="164" /> by the Minister and the Department.  We must ensure the quality of our beef if our export markets are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>I welcome the crackdown on the use of angel dust.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who introduced the animal remedies Bill, provided increased penalties for those who use illegal substances.  We should continue on that positive road.  I hope An Bord Bia continues the good work which has been done in the past.  It would be disastrous if consumers around the world perceived Irish food produce to be of inferior status.  The recent GATT Round will open up world trade even more.  The Government has played a key role in reforming the GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy.  There was a reference recently in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> to the possibility of major trade opportunities between Israel and this country with the prospect of a lasting peace in that country.  Recently a major food week was held in Jerusalem and, again, this is another area which should be examined.  The same is true of South Africa, now that the elections have taken place.  It is an area where there could be major possibilities for trade in the future.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the £230 million package for the agri-environmental programme which gives farmers the opportunity to consult and co-operate with people who care about the environment. It provides for grants linked to conservation and protecting the landscape, wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna.  Recently the United Farmers' Association spoke about the need for a marketing strategy for branded products organically produced. This welcome development deserves support.</P>
    <P>There are exciting possibilities in the area of food production.  The first Leader programme was very successful and I hope that east Galway, an area I represent, will be very much involved in the second.  Last Friday at a rural development day in Athenry, County Galway, opened by our Euro Commissioner, Mr. Padraig Flynn, I saw a display of products. The Leader project has been particularly helpful in areas that produce home <Col N="165" /> made butters, cheeses, etc., and has been the means of increasing the number of jobs in the west.  I hope the second Leader programme will be equally successful and enable us to expand into the alternative enterprises about which the Minister has spoken so often.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns about the second Leader programme relates to health regulations which have been the subject of controversy in the west.  I understand the Minister for Health has taken that up. Another concern relates to the planning regulations and sections of the Casual Trading Bill.  Many products are sold at markets and the local authority now has a major say in regard to the planning regulations and the allocation of trading licences.  I hope these matters will be resolved before the second programme is established.</P>
    <P>The role of the co-operative movement is most important.  It is the focus of many of the Leader groups which I hope will be a success in the western region where Mid Western Co-op is the umbrella group.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It sets up a single agency and provides the unity for which the Department is looking in market development.  I hope it will be a success and continue to improve the image of Irish food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the introduction of the Bill.  Setting up An Bord Bia brings us into line with other member states, many of which have a single agency dealing with export marketing.  A single food promotion agency will, with proper co-ordination, be able to maximise the available resources and embrace all sectors of the food industry.  We have some of the best primary producers in Europe of pigs and dairy products, poultry and meat.  We have the product and it is up to us to sell it at the best possible price.  It is comparatively easy to produce but the crunch comes in promotion and sales where, in the last few years, there have been great improvements, especially by individual firms and the co-operatives. Not alone have they invested heavily in product development, they <Col N="166" /> have succeeded in selling their product in a very competitive export market.  There has been a marked improvement in product presentation and we are now out in the market place meeting and competing with the best.  CBF has been effective in the export market, it will now be brought under the umbrella of An Bord Bia and will make a substantial contribution to the new board, particularly in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for setting up subsidiary boards for the product sectors with specific provision for a subsidiary board for meat and livestock.  The cattle sector is the most highly subsidised but it does not give returns, either financially or by way of jobs, commensurate with the investment by both national government and the European Union.  Other speakers referred to the live shipping of cattle which plays havoc with jobs at processing and slaughtering plants.  A few years ago we hoped that all beef would be exported in a processed form.  However, live shipping came back into its own with the variation in prices, and a competitive edge is required to ensure the best price for the primary producer.  The principal of a large publicily quoted firm suggested that that firm may withdraw from beef processing.  I hope that is not so because we need firms with the capacity, personnel and know-how to sell on the export markets.</P>
      <P>I hope also that greater efforts will be made in the area of pig production.  Until the 1960s pig production was the mainstay of small holdings in many counties, especially Cavan and Monaghan.  At that time about half the farms were involved, one way or another, in pig breeding.  In 1960 we had 111,000 nationally but this dropped dramatically to 2,000 in 1993. The average herd increased from eight in 1960 to 400 in 1993, but 80 per cent of pig production is confined to about 200 holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in pig production was a body blow to the small family farm, but they had to move with the times.  The National Pig Plan, set up to examine markets, came up with the idea of setting up eight efficient plants, with an investment <Col N="167" /> of £90 million.  As a result, the pig industry is internationally competitive, producing good quality breeding stock in highly modernised plants.  However, problems remain, with feed costs up to £20 a tonne.  Since feed costs represent 70 per cent of all production costs it is imperative that a great effort is made to reduce them.  The Department should deliver on the 15 per cent reduction, as promised, in CAP reform.  An Forbairt who succeeded the IDA, projected that pig production would increase to 4 million by the year 1997.  This is well within our capacity considering that production increased from 2.1 million in 1989 to 3 million in 1993.  If the figure of 4 million is reached it will represent exports of 125,000 tonnes which would ensure substantial additional jobs.  Unlike the beef industry, there are no live exports of pigs.</P>
    <P>Another area that has been targeted, and in which I hope An Bord Bia will become involved, is poultry production. World trade in poultry is rapidly growing. There was an increase in broiler production from about 3 million in 1960 to 45 million in 1992, and the figure continues to rise.  However, there is a feed cost differential in this area which presents great difficulties.  An Forbairt projected poultry exports of 50 million by 1998, maintaining 80 per cent of the home market.  Problems arose in the area with substantial imports of poultry meat in recent years.  However, the present demand is being met and I hope that continues.</P>
    <P>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, with availability of intervention, co-operatives and meat plants took the easy option and filled their cold stores on land and on ships at sea with products which should have been sold in the marketplace.  Those massive stocks caused serious problems in recent years.  On many occasions in this House I made the point that proper recognition was not given to processors who marketed their product.  One of those who did market their product was a much maligned beef processor who sold the product abroad.</P>
    <P>It is important that An Bord Bia concentrate <Col N="168" /> on marketing.  In County Monaghan there are 1,700 people employed in the food industry, including mushroom growing.  This area was completely disregarded when placing industries over the years.  If local people had not taken the initiative, it would be a barren wasteland industrially.  Thankfully, that area, with 2 per cent of the land and 1.5 per cent of the population, now produces 5 to 6 per cent of food exports.  This shows what can be done with initiative and enterprise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Culliton report, particularly the recommendations on a change of emphasis regarding our embassies. The report states that the staff should not be confined to career civil servants but that there would be people with professional knowledge in business and trade production.  This is a welcome development which is in line with calls made in this House over the years to make use of our embassies other than for diplomatic purposes.  They should be utilised to the greatest extent possible to ensure high sales of our produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that An Bord Glas would be involved with An Bord Bia.  I hope An Bord Glas follows the line taken in other countries to promote potatoes and potato products.  In countries such as America substantial funds are spent on promoting potatoes as a quality food. Prince Edward Island in Canada, to which many people emigrated at the time of the Famine, is one of the foremost potato exporters.  I was involved in the potato trade for many years and I am satisfied that there is a potential for job creation in that area.  The Minister should concentrate on increasing exports of potatoes.</P>
    <P>The continued high imports of ware potatoes is a matter of concern.  In the past much money was spent on the provision of storage, with the assistance of substantial grants.  I believe that was money well spent.  About 27 years ago, as a guest of the British Potato Marketing Board, I visited farms and packing centres in Scotland where large sums of money were spent on air controlled storage. Such storage facilities are now <Col N="169" /> available here.  I am not satisfied that we have an official record of ware potato imports.  A substantial tonnage of potatoes is being legally imported into Northern Ireland and distributed throughout the country.  There is probably a greater tonnage than has been recorded here.  As an island country, we have never exploited our advantage as a seed potato producer and in projecting new varieties.  This is labour-intensive industry and, with our continuing unemployment figures, it is an area which should be targeted.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the Leader Programmes but I believe that the county enterprise boards, as they are constituted &mdash; and I am a member of one &mdash; should concentrate on the food area. Opportunities exist, even on a small scale, in the area of prepared foods.  If one walks through any supermarket one can see the large amount of imported prepared foods on sale.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in conjunction with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, should impress upon the enterprise boards the need to target the food area.  The same would apply to the Leader programmes because they, in conjunction with the enterprise boards and Forbairt, should examine every area in the industry where jobs can be created. If that is done many more jobs might be created.</P>
    <P>Milk and milk products are among our primary exports and the co-operatives must be complimented on their move into the area of yoghurt production, etc. Many of the co-operatives are qualified to compete on the export market but a continual concern of people such as myself representing Connacht-Ulster is the siphoning off of quotas by the large co-operatives.  Thankfully, the quotas will now remain in the region.</P>
    <P>Prior to entering politics I was involved with the co-operatives and they were always dependent on increasing their output.  Production has now levelled off and they are unable to get any additional quotas.  The ordinary co-operatives have been of great benefit to many small farmers because they provided a lifeline for <Col N="170" /> them through the use of credit given on an extended basis against their milk or produce.  The co-operatives have greatly assisted those farmers and for that reason I would like to see them continue.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the REPS, the rural environmental programme.  In my area where there is much intensification we are experiencing many problems in regard to the disposal of farm waste. Farmers will be at a serious disadvantage in regard to availing of the funding, which I believe is approximately £100 million, to deal with these problems.  In regard to pollution control, I hope the Minister will ensure that substantial grants will be made available to farmers for the provision of storage tanks because it has been provided this year that additional tanks are necessary.  This will be a real problem in years to come and I hope the Department responsible for pollution control will provide the necessary funding to deal with the problems caused by pollution.</P>

However, on reading the Minister's Second Stage speech, and taking account of the great furore over the announcement of the establishment of An Bord Bia, I believe in practice the board will not turn out to be what the planners, the farmers' groups, the producers and the processors would have wanted.  I am sorry to say that because I fully understand the Government's intention. I do wish to be overly negative; parts of this Bill will work to our advantage but it contains some major flaws.</P>
      <P>Since we joined the Common Market in the early 1970s we have shown that we have a wonderful capability for the production of good quality food but one of our main problems is that we have never been particularly adept at marketing our products.  I am not referring to the agricultural community only.  This may be due to the fact that unlike many of our competitors, we do not have a second or third language to use when selling food around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that there <Col N="171" /> are many components to the whole food chain, from the day that a product is first researched in an institute until it is sold on a supermarket shelf to a German or a Dutch housewife.  Many people are involved in that process but, apart from a number of high profile companies, we have not been to the fore in that area. Those companies sold their own products, which I realise can cause some difficulties. There were occasions over the years when Irish companies were actually competing with each other to the detriment of those companies and of the primary producers, particularly of meat.</P>
    <P>If one were to examine the Bill superficially, one might say that there was a great need for An Bord Bia to co-ordinate all the various organisations but I do not believe the impact of the board will be great.  Unless the exporting companies can sell, through their own resources, on the foreign markets, there is not much more a promotional body can do.</P>
    <P>Before I entered politics I was involved in the livestock business at mart level. CBF is a body for which I have great admiration.  It is consumer driven but it never lost sight of the reason for its existence. It maintained the loyalty of the primary producers while getting a product the consumer wanted.  CBF appeared to be on the side of the farmers and it was rarely criticised by them.</P>
    <P>There are too many sectional interests &mdash; everyone has a little flag to fly.  I thought An Bord Bia would put all the little flags together and fly one big one but I do not think that will happen.  Hopefully, in five years time the various groups involved in food production will say An Bord Bia was good for them and for the country.</P>
    <P>We have good quality food but we must protect our image.  If we cannot eliminate mad cow disease and the use of angel dust, people will not eat red meat and that will wreck our future.  It is one thing to put a law on the Statute Book but quite another to enforce it.  The Minister does not have sufficient staff to enforce <Col N="172" /> the law.  The will is there but resources are lacking.  It is typical of Governments to have grandiose schemes but not to provide the necessary backup to implement them.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what kind of power subsidy boards will have or how they will be organised.  They will be glorified tidy towns committees or chambers of commerce; they will say a lot but have no power.  The main board will decide on the imposition of levies.  Animal levies will be imposed.  There is nothing wrong with the agricultural community establishing a fund to help sell their product on the export market but I do not wish to see money taken from a group the majority of whom are not doing well. But for headage payments many farmers would not make a decent living.  Levies should not be extracted from them to keep others in cushy jobs.  If CBF is removed from the pivotal role they play, primary producers will not be happy.  If An Bord Bia loses their confidence it will have lost a great plank.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bainne has been extremely successful and I compliment it.  However, some dairies prefer to go it alone.  This involves risk taking.  Dealing in the meat trade is worse than the Stock Exchange because one never knows where one is with that business.  People in cushy jobs give a return for their money but do not go beyond that.  Some companies and groups are prepared to take a risk.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, and I hope An Bord Bia will adopt a determined and energetic approach. However, it will be useless unless it maintains the trust of constituent bodies.</P>
    <P>I understand An Bord Bia will decide on the levies.  Members will be appointed to the board for a variety of reasons and I have no doubt but that their record will entitle them to serve on it.  However, their interest might be at variance with what certain sections might want.  We must not forget the primary producer. They take risks and if things go wrong we will have 10,000 fewer farmers on the land.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the proposed level of involvement in research and development <Col N="173" /> by An Bord Bia.  I am very impressed with the research being carried out by Teagasc at its centre in Dunsinea which I have visited on a number of occasions in recent years.  Many companies have paid for research to be carried out on their behalf at this centre. While I welcome the involvement of Teagasc in such research, in a country with approximately three million consumers, research and development in major products will always be a problem.  What involvement will An Bord Bia have in research and development?</P>
    <P>Most farmers who have studied this Bill believe there will be more levies and less funding from the Exchequer, all in the development of more progressive farming, processing and exporting.  I hope the Minister will be able to achieve a balance in this area.  The people on the board of CBF would not have gone too far in this direction, and many farmers are very worried about these progressive developments.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on the fishing industry but I do not understand why the fishing industry has not been included in this Bill.  How could CBF be included but not An Bord Iascaigh Mhara?  Did the Minister decide to opt for an easier target?  Even though they will play their part, some people in CBF will be worried about many of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many people, including some Deputies, are concerned about the need to strike a balance between the number of live cattle we export and our exports of meat and meat products.  It is very important that there is competition on the ground, so to speak, for cattle and sheep.  We want to create jobs &mdash; the more we can create the better &mdash; but there is little point in creating an additional 500 to 600 jobs in the meat industry if it leads to a reduction in the number of farmers by 5,000 to 6,000.  The Minister and his Minister of State have sounded warnings that if they get a chance they will put a stop to the export of live cattle and sheep.  If they do this, it will be to their peril.  I accept the need to strike a balance, but there should be competition at marts and between factories; <Col N="174" /> competition is the life of industry. There are many other things which could and should be done to ensure that more cattle are available for export.</P>
    <P>The Government has continually referred to the importance of GATT and the CAP.  The consequences of these agreements are now coming home to roost because of faulty negotiations, it is likely that we will not have any more cattle to export and we will no longer be able to export to many markets.  We need to strike a balance in this area too and it will be to the peril of the Minister and his Minister of State if they put a stop to the export of live cattle and sheep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident from the Minister's speech that the food sector, which accounts for approximately 22 per cent of total exports, is one of the most important sectors of the economy. Twenty per cent of manufacturing jobs depend on this sector which also makes a significant contribution to reducing our balance of payments.  The output from this sector is approximately £7.6 billion, a staggering figure.  It must also be remembered that the indigenous raw material for this sector is very attractive to other countries which do not enjoy similar conditions.  We produce a quality food in a natural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This puts in context the large potential for job creation in the food sector.  As an urban Deputy I am particularly interested in this aspect of the food sector, including manufacturing, transport, advertising and delivery.  I will refer later to processing, packaging and marketing but will concentrate for the moment on the transport element.  The transport of food from its place of manufacture to its place of sale, including its display and marketing, account for numerous jobs.  The potential for job creation in this sector is under-estimated. Due to the efforts of various organisations <Col N="175" /> to promote our products abroad and present them in an attractive manner, we have a fantastic reputation abroad for quality produce.  In this context, the home market, which sells many foreign products, is under-explored. People should be made more aware of the fact that if they purchase Irish produce they will help create more employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the board would consider such elements as capital investment, research and development, marketing, marketing promotion and human resources.  Further consideration should be given to increasing the level of awareness among consumers of the manufacturing process.  There is a substantial gap between producers and consumers when one considers the amount of handling and production that takes place in manufacturing.  For example, it leads to a lack of perception that a product produced on the farm eventually arrives on the shelves of a supermarket at home or abroad having been promoted at some prestigious event, leading to a total lack of recognition on the part of its producer.  Some way must be devised of having a closer connection between the elements of production and manufacture which would also ensure that all of our resources are used to best advantage.</P>
    <P>I note that fish will be included in the provisions of this Bill.  We are all aware of the importance of the fishing industry nationwide and its lack of development when one considers the size around our coastline, the large fishing stocks available to us, and the recent pattern of eating fish on days other than Friday.</P>

      <P>And the herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember having been wakened on Friday mornings as a child by the sound of people selling fresh herrings wrapped in newspaper.  We have come a long way from those small vans whose owners endeavoured to sell herrings while they were fresh since, the further the distance from the coast, the less <Col N="176" /> attractive was the flavour of the herring. There are many resources now available to us to ensure that a product is presented in an acceptable form to consumers at home and abroad.  In this respect I am fascinated to observe people's ingenuity in presenting perishable commodities in such an attractive manner.</P>
      <P>Another Member mentioned the county enterprise boards and their role in the development of our food industry. It is to be hoped that An Bord Bia will work closely with them.  Aer Lingus and other international airlines' transport networks should be borne in mind in the further development and exportation of our food products.  If we can resort to An Bord Bia to develop products suitable for consumption at home and abroad, to be transported within the various European Union networks, that would be a most useful exercise in the promotion of our foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>My only involvement in this area in the past &mdash; the one about which I know most &mdash; was with the artistic aspects of advertising and marketing of goods.  It is now acknowledged that successful marketing is the key factor in the promotion and presentation of foodstuffs and other commodities, quality packaging being particularly important.  We must ensure that the greatest amount of finance, time and effort, is devoted to media advertising at home and abroad.  Henceforth we shall have an agency that will police presentation of products both within and without this jurisdiction, ensuring that prime space is devoted to the display of Irish goods so that producers, manufacturers and processors will benefit.  We have come a long way from the design packaging problems experienced in the sixties when I was involved in alternative packaging in manufacturing we had to engage designers from Scandinavian countries to advise us; that was when I occupied the College of Art adjacent to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also moved a considerable distance from the first Kilkenny Shop enterprise when we were shown what could be done in that area.  I remember somebody requesting that the Friendly <Col N="177" /> match box be redesigned but we were told that was not possible.  They were right; it was never redesigned.  Some things must retain their initial marketing impetus.  An Bord Bia should collate all the good will and expertise available to ensure that our food industry is afforded the opportunities for development it so richly deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the Bill, I have some reservations about its provisions. In the past 20 years the fragmentation of marketing of Irish food products has been a major impediment to the maximisation of their price in the marketplace.  The type of <i>ad hoc</i> progress made, rationalising parts of the industry, omitting fish, dairying having nothing to do with the provisions of the Bill, while talking about Irish food appears to me to be a totally unnecessary fragmentation due mainly to the pulling forces within the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton was correct to say that in the media every other evening the live export question arises.  We were supposed to have gone through that matter some years ago, having advanced the meat processing sector, live trade appearing to be no longer a viable option, yet it appears to be re-emerging as a threat to the beef sector.  I never can grasp farmer politics, the fact that farming organisation leaders and farmers themselves accept the levies and costs being imposed on the back of the primary producer.  In addition, the inter-relationship between the private beef processing sector and CBF over many years was less than cohesive or sufficiently organised for the betterment of the primary producer and the beef processing sector.  We appear to repeat these cycles but, unfortunately, do not appear to learn much from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I revert to my first contact with the beef processing industry, then in the hands of a number of private producers, Irish Meat Packers, the farming community, through Cork Marts, contended that the way forward was through control of the beef processing sector, all subscriptions being paid, the business taken <Col N="178" /> over and a new plant built at Midleton. The same happened in the case of Clover Meats who launched into the added-value area, when everything seemed to be progressing satisfactorily, but, alas, so many years later they have all folded up, leaving farmers owed considerable sums, and the cycle begins all over again.</P>
    <P>We hear that at present one of our major plc co-operatives, the Kerry Group, is talking about leaving the meat processing sector because it is not commercially viable, that they could better invest their resources elsewhere.  Indeed their shareholders, probably now institutional investors rather than the farmers, recognise that this competent food processing group no longer perceive it viable or profitable to remain in such an important industry.  They had been deeply involved with the farming community in the south-west, yet they contend that a major facility for beef producers of that greater Munster region will no longer be available to them.</P>
    <P>It would appear to be a very complex industry that makes or loses small fortunes over different cycles.  Something I have never understood is why, at departmental and CBF level, there has always been this chasm between processors and operators.  Further down the line in the processing sector there is a multiplicity of small added-value operators who do not have the power to penetrate the market, and put a label on Irish beef so that it can be sold as a prime product. That leads one to consider the nonsense of the lack of ability to rationalise international markets for Irish food.  In that respect, politicians, industrialists and farmers all share the blame.</P>
    <P>The absolute nonsense of the dairying sector, the cornerstone of the food business, is highlighted by the fact that some of the biggest producers representing farmers are taken to the High Court to be displaced from the board of An Bord Bainne, they having manipulated marketing information in order to market the same product in a different plastic container.  For example, in the dairy processing sector one need only look at the fragmentation of the Irish product available <Col N="179" /> to a German supermarket buyer.  He can get Dairygold, Golden Vale, Avonmore and a multiplicity of companies all trying to sell an Irish product, with different brands, different plastic containers and a different set of overheads.  There would also be different marketing personnel all working on the farmer's gallon of milk in the dairy processing sector.  I see this Bill as scratching the surface of what is needed if we are to become a food producer with international muscle. Total sales of large French combines, of the Swiss Nestlé and US meat processors are virtually the exports of this country. For those reasons I am concerned that in the 1990s we are still not getting an international cohesive marketing image to get Irish products into the primary price bracket.  In the beef sector there will always be commodity sales to the Middle East and to State run countries who want to bulk buy and do not want the added-value supermarket shelf.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our major problem in the food processing sector is the competition we create internationally among ourselves.  Near disasters, difficulties with processors and rescue packages, removal of support by Government and the need for the exhaust valve of the live exports etc., go in cycles because of <i>ad hoc</i> and unplanned marketing.</P>
    <P>At any of the international food fairs such as Anuga or Sial there will be Irish stands and international competition. BIM will be at one corner and Bord Bainne may not wish to participate in the Irish stand but to do their own promotion. There is a lack of cohesion, where one is trying to sell into a market of 300 million people in mainland Europe and the UK, by processors who are small in the international area but big at home.  The IDA attempted to get Waterford and Avonmore together but they did not pool their resources for the betterment of the producers and the marketing operation because of the empire building of the various organisations in the food processing sector.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the political decisiveness from Agriculture House in trying <Col N="180" /> to bring the farming community, processors and the various participants in the food processing sector together did not reach its full potential over the past 20 years.  This is our natural resource, the product that brings in the Deutsche Marks, the francs and other foreign currencies and creates the value added jobs. Unfortunately, we have not been able to lead the industry to where international supermarket groups have a brand for Irish products.  They do not have a quality brand stamped on Irish beef today. Twenty years after we talked about being the bread basket of Europe, the green country, the environmentally friendly producer, we should get maximum product. Is it not still the case that some Irish beef in the UK market is being labelled Scottish and selling at a higher price because of their marketing techniques?</P>
    <P>The role of CBF has been undermined by the industry during the past 20 years and I do not expect that to change dramatically.  The Culliton report should be fully implemented and the food sector put together by a market led organisation as an umbrella body over the industries comprising it.  BIM should have been included as part of food exports.  What is the need for fragmentation?  Bord Glas is now included.  Products should be branded and the maximum price paid to the producer.  Much of what exists today is a burden and a cost on the primary producer. If only Bord Bainne embraced the entire dairy sector, bringing every gallon of milk into the Kerrygold brand, we would have a very powerful Bord Bainne. Instead we have a multiplicity of small food empires in an Irish context and minor league players in an international context.  Unfortunately our industry is fragmented and I do not see how this Bill can improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on the establishment of An Bord Bia.  The Irish food industry is fundamental to our economy, accounting for 22 per cent of our exports and 20 per cent of manufacturing employment. The need to promote Irish food has been well recognised and documented by <Col N="181" /> the expert group, who examined the food industry, and by Culliton.  It is even more important now as a result of some of the changes in the European and world markets because of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the changes as a result of the GATT agreement and our membership of the Single Market.</P>
      <P>There has never been a greater opportunity for the development of the food industry.  I am aware of this in my own constituency where many of the food manufacturing and processing plants are expanding and bringing in new workers as a result of an increased demand.  They are added value in so far as the food is prepared and ready for the table.  The target of 1,500 to 2,000 jobs per annum is realistic as outlined in the export report. The IDA has set ambitious and realistic targets for job creation in the future. The food industry has great potential, we recognise that we produce some of the finest food in the world, particularly in the beef and dairy sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 set out the functions of the board.  The new board will take over the functions of CBF and some of the functions of Bord Tráchtála and Bord Glas.  Following the establishment of this board there will be a need for co-operation and co-ordination between the various bodies.  I sympathise with the views of my colleague, Deputy Lawlor.  It would be an ideal world if the food industry and everything related to it was under the aegis of one Minister.  Unfortunately, because of the nature of the system, that is not possible in any country because many Departments of State have an input to the development and promotion of the same industry.  However, co-ordination and co-operation between Departments and the various State agencies is important. The IDA is doing extremely good work.  I have been very impressed by its commitment to and establishment of new industries in that sector creating many jobs.  It has a very professional approach. What working arrangement will be between the IDA food sector and An Bord Bia?  What working relationship will it have with bodies such as BIM <Col N="182" /> charged with promoting the food sector &mdash; if the responsibility for the promotion and marketing of fish is transferred &mdash; and An Bord Bainne?</P>
    <P>There is a need for flexibility.  If the Minister finds that it would be beneficial to make changes in relation to promotion and marketing of food products he should not have to return to the House with further legislation which may result in delays.  Emphasis must be placed on the need to create new jobs and maintain existing jobs.  As long as it would be in keeping with the principles of the Bill the Minister should have discretion to transfer functions from existing boards to An Bord Bia and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The expert group dealt with the question of seasonality of production in its report.  This is an important issue and needs to be addressed.  We must focus on the need to create new jobs and maintain existing jobs.  I dealt with this issue on a number of occasions in the House.  There is insufficient co-operation at all levels between State Departments and agencies. In relation to the local authorities, there is a need to adopt a sense of urgency in processing planning applications which involve job creation.  I am not suggesting we should not adhere strictly to the law; we should but there must be a greater sense of urgency.  This does not apply only to agencies which deal with the food sector; there is a need for co-operation between all the Departments which have a role to play.  For example, the Department of the Environment has a role in developing our infrastructure.  There is no point in having an effective and efficient Bord Bia if we do not have the capacity to produce the goods for which it will find a market.</P>
    <P>When An Bord Bia is established there will be a need to provide back-up services for producers.  I referred previously in the House to a case where a food industry received an order for 20 tonnes of beefburgers from outside the European Union but due to a lack of urgency in implementing a European Union decision, on the question of whether officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the Revenue <Col N="183" /> Commissioners should inspect meat, the order was lost to a company in Belgium.  There is a need for a rapid response to ensure that processors who find markets for their produce will receive the maximum support of the State in resolving difficulties such as this.</P>
    <P>The quality and nutrition value of food is of great importance to the consumer who very often will make decisions on health grounds.  The food advisory committee, under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Health, will, therefore, have an important role.  What will the working relationship be between the food advisory committee and the new Bord Bia?  We must satisfy the consumer who is influenced by health considerations. For example, in the ongoing debate on the question of butter versus margarine it can be confusing when experts take up both sides of the argument. There is a necessity for An Bord Bia to have access to the best information available.  I have no doubt that it will do a good job in promoting our food abroad and in creating the right image.  As more countries become aware that the food we produce is of high quality there will be increased demand for our produce.</P>
    <P>I am glad that funding will be available for research and development.  There is a need to carry out research to discover what the consumer wants and how he likes to see food presented.  This is becoming more important and has an influence on the way all goods, particularly food products, are marketed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Tourism and Trade will each appoint a nominee to the board of the new Bord Bia and the Minister will appoint the remainder. I am sure he will select them with great care.  He should take his time and choose those with knowledge, expertise and ability. It is essential that the board promotes our products abroad to the maximum advantage.  We should also like to see new jobs being created as there is now a great opportunity to develop the food sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> On the question of where the headquarters of An Bord Bia should be located, Deputy Creed made a good case on behalf of Cork.  While one does not want to be parochial on a national issue, there is no harm in highlighting the contribution that my own constituency, Monaghan in particular, has made to the food sector.  There is intensive production of poultry, pigs and mushrooms. A high percentage of the population of County Monaghan, which stands at 50,000, is involved in food processing.  This is the largest industry in the county and it has made a valuable contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesperson for trade I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  There is no doubt that food represents our greatest opportunity to increase exports and create jobs.  However, as stated by many speakers, we have not performed to our full potential in that regard.  I hope this initiative by the Minister will ensure that there will be a more co-ordinated and focused marketing approach to our food products.  GATT presents many opportunities for Irish exporters, but we will be subjected to much more competition from Third World countries as a result.  We will have to fight for a share of the market.  Penetration of European markets by our food produce has not been good, one of the reasons being the attractiveness of intervention.  We opted for the soft option rather than creating market niches for ourselves on the Continent and in Britain, although we export more then 30 per cent of our indigenous produce and most of our agricultural produce to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall having a discussion in the mid-1980s with Denis Brosnan, chief executive of Kerry Co-op &mdash; before it diversified from dairy products &mdash; and he told me that there were markets in Europe for the taking by Irish exporters, but we did not avail of them because of the attractiveness of intervention.  For a very small gain we took the soft option and as a result we lost a number of European markets.  It will be difficult to increase <Col N="185" /> penetration in continental markets because some of the shelf space we should have in Europe has been taken by our competitors.</P>
    <P>The weakness of sterling will pose major difficulties for Irish food exports to Britain.  An article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> indicates that if the present trend continues and sterling remains weak against the pound our food exports will be placed in a very uncompetitive position and we could once again lose our market share, with resultant job losses.  The Government should be vigilant regarding exchange rates.  In conjunction with the Central Bank, it should introduce contingency plans to avoid a recurrence of what happened in 1992.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to monitor the position carefully.  Apart from the agricultural sector, I have received reports that some of our other exports are under threat because of currency fluctuations.  The sooner we have a single currency in Europe the less exposed our exports will be to the effects of currency fluctuations.  I tabled a question in this regard to the Minister for Tourism and Trade who gave me the impression that the Government was not very concerned about campaigning for a single currency in the immediate future. That is regrettable.  The sooner we use the ecu for trading arrangements in Europe the better it will be for our food and other industries.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the large number of Irish operators who are going on a solo run around Europe to sell Irish products.  That leads to much duplication and misuse of scarce resources in terms of marketing input.  It takes from the focus on the drive to sell Irish products abroad.  I hope that as a result of this Bill there will be more focus on the sale of Irish products.  A commitment was given by the Minister for Tourism and Trade that we would adopt a one-stop-shop approach to selling Irish products abroad, that we should sell Ireland as a total unit.  We should tie together the activities of An Bord Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte and the IDA and sell <Col N="186" /> Ireland abroad as a unit rather than in the fragmented way we do at present.</P>
    <P>There is still great potential for the export of our produce to Britain.  It is our closest market and has a consumer population of 55 million people.  While there was growth in our exports to Germany last year, there are still endless opportunities for us to penetrate that market.  There are also great opportunities for the export of our produce to the Far East and Pacific Rim countries.  I look forward to making a further contribution tomorrow.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the increasing incidence of violent crime, especially against vulnerable members of the community,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>calls on the Government to restore law and order so that law-abiding citizens can go about their lives without fear of attack from criminals who are increasingly <Col N="187" /> immune from punishment or even the pretence of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The breakdown in law and order has been callously disregarded.  The Minister for Justice has been cavalier in dismissing warnings, often twisting what Deputies say to imply some wrongdoings by Deputies for even raising the matter.  At the same time the Minister has been abusing powers in a selfish and self-serving way to her personal political advantage. When I sought an opportunity to raise this matter in the presence of the Minister she chose to remain mute.  Instead, that night she went to the Seanad and, while admitting the action, claimed these were proper activities for her to be involved in.  I ask the Minister to explain why she decided to override the judgment of the Garda Commissioner on an operational matter for which he has responsibility. The Garda Commissioner refused a request from the Minister to move Garda district headquarters from Oughterard to Salthill and the Minister involved powers under section 6 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924 to direct him to do so based on &ldquo;her personal knowledge&rdquo; of the constituency. The Minister is alleged to have quipped that she has seen the polling boxes in Oughterard and that this would not do her any political damage.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has not dealt with allegations that she is directly and personally involved in vetting all applications from prisoners from County Galway, for compassionate release, temporary release or transfer to a training unit or an open prison in a way which directly discriminates against prisoners from County Galway in a most objectionable, unethical and dissolute manner. Such interferences in the criminal justice system are obnoxious and offend those communities which are treated in a separate and different manner.  The justice system is being used to perpetrate injustice in a way which is demoralising the Garda and the prison service.  How can the Labour Party remain in a Government which permits such behaviour?  The Minister must assure the House that <Col N="188" /> those malpractices will be discontinued and, if not, the matter should be considered directly by the Government and by the House.</P>
    <P>There are serious problems in every facet of the criminal justice system.  No apparent action has been taken by the Minister for Justice to solve them other than passing them to committees, review groups or deciding by looking into her heart how Garda resources should be deployed or what Galway prisoners should be given early release or other remissions.  That arrogance cannot be tolerated in a civilised democracy.  I am glad we will have an opportunity to hear from the Minister in this Chamber, rather than to have to read her comments made in the other House.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána does not have the manpower to deal with the level of crime. Given the added problems they have faced in recent days and the potential for terrorist activities, the resources available to the Garda Síochána are laughable compared to those available to the RUC. I accept it is not possible to provide absolute security.  With the threat of terrorism breathing down our throats, the undermining of State institutions by the IRA and other criminal organisations, crime at an all time high level in the community and with people afraid to leave their homes, how can we justify Garda numbers of 500 less than a few years ago?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will explain to the lady to whom I spoke in Rialto yesterday, who had eight stitches in her forehead, had been followed home, had her door kicked in and whose elderly mother had been mugged on two occasions, why Garda numbers have been allowed to decrease?  The Minister's so-called crime package about which we have heard so much since last December will do little to tackle the problem.  The last occasion such a package was introduced was during the period Deputy Collins was Minister for Justice.  He announced a £100 million crime package, not a £66 million one over a number of years as promised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The budget for the Department of Justice and the criminal justice system is of <Col N="189" /> the order of £550 million.  An additional £66 million over the next five years only allows for inflation and is not a real increase.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, said we would have an airborne section in the Garda, but all we have had are airborne Ministers, civil servants and gardaí who travelled around the world to inspect such equipment. There has been no mention of an airborne garda unit except in the Estimates for the Department of Justice where, to the embarrasment of all, a token sum of £1,000 has been provided.  It is time we called a halt to such PR exercises, photo opportunities and made a real and determined effort to provide the resources necessary to deal with lawlessness, vandalism and crime which has spiralled out of control.</P>
    <P>People cannot recall so many violent murders in such a short period.  Three people were shot dead in County Clare, a woman was shot dead, having left her home in the west of Ireland and a man was shot dead as he stood next to a bonfire in Dublin in October last.  Regularly, people have their doors kicked in and shots fired at them.  Many of the murders in Dublin are drug related.  People have become prisoners behind locked doors, alarms, shops with shutters and must contend with roads with ramps.  People in rural Ireland, who have felt safe in the past, are terrified to go out.  Under the policing regulations which came into effect in the early 1990s, they are expected to report problems they encounter to a green box.</P>
    <P>What has happened to policing policy? Why does the Government not have a policing policy?  Why do we not have a proper plan to deal with crime which includes a policing policy?  I do not know if the recruitment figures promised will do much more than cover Garda natural retirement in that period.  The 500 manpower shortage in the Garda should be dealt with by means of short term recruitment and, if necessary, recruiting retired staff for a short period while Garda recruits are undergoing training.  We need innovation, gardaí on the beat and not green boxes.  We need gardaí who <Col N="190" /> know what is happening and are prepared to take action to deal with the problems faced by people in the community.  We cannot continue to allow a situation where people cannot go about their daily lives without the fear of being raped or mugged, of having their handbags snatched or, may the Lord protect us, of being shot.  There has been a progressive deterioration in our drugs problem to a stage where drugs are now sold openly on the streets of our cities and towns and are freely available in prisons.  In the last ten days I spoke to two people in an inner city flats complex.  One man told me that he had learned his drug habit in prison. He went into prison without a heroin problem and came out a heroin addict. This morning a man in an inner city flats complex told me his son went into prison and would never have had a drug problem had he not taken heroin there.</P>
    <P>Whatever happened to law and order? This is central to the crime problem we face.  People are mugging and beating and robbing, intimidating people and driving them out of their businesses, locking people in their homes and striking fear into the hearts of old and vulnerable people because they are out to get money at any cost to feed a drug habit.  Drugs are sold openly on the street, not in Foxrock or certain parts of the city or the country, but their sale is tolerated in certain parts of our inner cities.  That is wholly unacceptable and we should not tolerate or accept people going into prison, partly to be rehabilitated, picking up a drug habit there and coming out worse criminals than they went in.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have blamed inter-divisional rivalry in the Garda Síochána for the failure of effectiveness in dealing with the dreadful events of recent weeks in Counties Clare and Galway.  If these allegations are found to be true, that ineffectiveness must be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We must be thankful that the outrage in Pearse Street last weekend did not result in the mass murder of 300 or 400 people.  However, questions must be asked about the ease with which the terrorists managed to reach the heart of <Col N="191" /> Dublin with firearms and commercial explosives.  With Garda strength at its present low level we have to wonder how confident people can feel that future outrages of this kind can be prevented.  The RUC chief constable said on television some months ago &mdash; I heard him myself &mdash; that it was not a matter of if but when this sort of thing would happen.  Let the Minister tell this House what steps were taken on receipt of those warnings?  Were those warnings given privately at an earlier stage before they were given publicly? What steps were taken on receipt of those warnings to upgrade the security and defence of people in this city and country against terrorist attack, which took place with such ease last Saturday night?</P>
    <P>The numbers in the Garda should be immediately increased in the manner I have outlined and the process of civilianisation within the Garda should be accelerated to free gardaí who are currently deskbound for duty on the streets of our cities and towns.  The neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes should be given fresh impetus to help alleviate the fears of people, particularly old people living alone or in isolated places.</P>
    <P>As to the law, the shackles that bind the Garda in tackling crime should be loosened so that they can be effective.  I was criticial of parts of the criminal justice system when the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill went through this House recently.  I criticised the Bill on two fronts, in that it did not contain sufficiently strong powers to deal with criminals and that it contained sections which interfered with the rights of non-criminals and which would make criminals laugh their heads off.  To be fair to the Minister, she did accept a number of amendments, and the Bill when passed was better than when it first came before the House.  However, the first prosecution under that Act was against a person handing out insulting literature. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the literature that was handed out is not the point.  The point is that this public order <Col N="192" /> Bill was supposed to give effect to powers to deal with the problems in the community.</P>
    <P>Legislation which should have been passed to deal with such problems has not been passed by this House.  I refer specifically to the opportunity which has been lost yet again, while the European elections and the by-elections are going on, to put a referendum on bail to the country.  In a system where one is innocent until proven guilty, I do not believe everybody who is charged should be locked up.  I do believe, however, that judges should have discretion.  If they know that the person appearing before them is a known drug pusher or godfather, they should be allowed to take that into account in deciding whether that person should be allowed bail.  There is a lack of understanding in this House of the problems people in local authority flats complexes face.  This is serious because, first, people are taking the law into their own hands and, second, the problem itself is out of hand and results in the infliction of terrible injury on many people.  At a flats complex that I called to recently, a woman I have known for a number of years and have had contact with in the past had buried her third child because of AIDS and had a fourth child who was developing full blown AIDS. Another woman and her husband both had HIV &mdash; the husband had developed AIDS but the poor man had not yet been told that, and the children do not know. That community has been inundated with drug pushing for many years and the forces of law and order have not come to their assistance.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on the lack of resources for the Garda; they should have the resources to deal with this problem. I have to say, however, that judges have been unrealistic in the evidence they seek before they will agree to evict a corporation tenant from a flats complex. I do not advocate hanging and flogging or the wholesale eviction of tenants. However, if one or two drug pushers turn a flats complex of 300 or 400 people into a haven for junkies who come in taxis from as far away as Dun Laoghaire or <Col N="193" /> Malahide, they should be prosecuted if they do not obey the law.  One of the regulations under the law is that they must, as tenants of the corporation, behave in accordance with their tenancy agreement.  The corporation does not evict people easily and when they move to evict, having given several warnings, the District Court judge requires four witnesses which the local authority cannot provide because people are intimidated and will not give evidence.  I want the law changed so that the evidence of the Garda superintendent or a member of higher rank who is aware of continuing complaints against the tenant in question will be accepted, not as compelling evidence but as evidence, when a judge is deciding whether that tenant should be evicted.  I suggest that because at present witnesses cannot be obtained.  People are terrified.  They form their own committees. In some cases they go much further and form their own &ldquo;kangaroo court&rdquo; and march these people before them and order them to leave.</P>
    <P>I do not support people taking the law into their own hands, but I understand the position these people find themselves in, most of them having nothing to do with terrorists or terrorist organisations or anything of that kind, when the forces of law and order, including the Judiciary, let them down.  I want to see that provision included in the miscellaneous provisions Bill which the Minister promised to bring before the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the prison system.  As the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee, in its 1993 report, suggested, the prison system is &ldquo;an appalling vista&rdquo;. This is not something new.  The 1992 report regarded Mountjoy as a potential volcano, a prison running on crisis control. In the 1991 report the visiting committee reported:</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison is greatly overcrowded. The prisoners find themselves in multiple cells.  On occasions there are no cells available.  The serious riots during the year were caused primarily by boredom and by frustration and by overcrowding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> This report refers only to Mountjoy; there are other prisons and further problems.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the Whitaker report in 1985 some improvements in the penal system have been carried out, but much remains to be done.  If we are serious about dealing with the current crime problem we must ensure that the prison system works efficiently, effectively and economically.  More than £550 million will be spent this year on the criminal justice system.  If the prison system is a failure &mdash; and it is &mdash; much of this money is being wasted since prisons are in part institutes for recycling criminals. Recidivism, the rate at which prisoners re-offend, is probably between 50 and 80 per cent, although it is difficult accurately to gauge this figure at any given time since criminal justice statistics in general and prison statistics in particular are not produced in a way that is conducive to accurate measurement of the problem.</P>
    <P>Whitaker outlined the purposes imprisonment may serve as follows: punishment of offenders for the offences committed by them; deterrence of offenders from committing the same or similar offences after release from prison and deterrence of other who may be inclined to commit the same or similar offences; reformation or rehabilitation of offenders so that on release they will have been persuaded and equipped to avoid criminality; and prevention of offenders from committing the same or similar offences during the periods for which they are imprisoned.  It must be noted that people are not sent to prison to be punished; imprisonment is the punishment. The prison system as it currently operates is not an effective system of reformation, rehabilitation or prevention, although it is clear that nobody wishes to lose their liberty and for this reason prison is a limited deterrent.</P>
    <P>It is Fine Gael philosophy in every area of policy that people should, where they are capable of doing so, ultimately take responsibility for their own actions.  This is not an imposition on individuals; rather it is a recognition of the worth and dignity <Col N="195" /> of each individual.  &ldquo;Every person counts&rdquo; is the message which is central to Fine Gael philosophy.  This applies equally to the victim and the perpetrator of crime.  The &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; brigade, while making what are often popular noises, do not effectively contribute to easing the problem of the victim.  This should be done by confronting the perpetrator with his or her crime and seeking to bring about a change in behaviour by rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>About 6,000 people per annum go through the prison system.  The population of prisoners at any one time is slightly more than one-third of this figure. Approximately 280 people per annum are imprisoned for non-payment of fines or debts to banks and financial institutions. In a reply to a parliamentary question in my name I was told that 14 per cent of all committals to prison are for non-payment of fines, although at any given stage only 1 to 2 per cent of the prison population is made up of such defaulters.  It is essential that provision be made at time of sentencing for the collection of fines and/or deduction of money at source, or confiscation of assets if fines are not paid.  Prison places should be reserved for those who need to be incarcerated.  All prisoners are incarcerated at considerable cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes to build a new prison to include 200 new places. The Whitaker report pointed out that the capital cost of each cell was £150,000 in 1985 terms &mdash; in today's terms that is probably nearer to £250,000.  It could cost up to £6 million per year in running costs in addition to the capital cost.  Before expanding the prison system we must ensure that the system is reformed and that it works.  To build additional prison spaces without reforming the system would be to expand the existing recycling institute model.  This means there will be an increasing base of recidivists.  The prison system, far from being part of the solution, is part of the problem.  Until we reform the prisons, that part of the problem will continue to grow, thereby unleashing criminals on the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> In a recent ten-year period in the United States the prison population trebled but, despite this, crime continued to grow to record levels.  Whitaker identified the following range of non-custodial penalties which should be used by the courts to dispose at their discretion of lesser offences: probation, fines, confiscation of income or assets in certain cases, restitution to society generally or to the victim directly, conditionally suspended prison sentences, community service orders, disqualifications and withdrawal of licences, requirement of attendance at a treatment centre for alcohol or drug abuse as an alternative to imprisonment, and other restraints on liberty operable within the community, for example, compulsory residence in approved hostels, compulsory participation on training programmes and reporting at intervals to the authorities. To this list might be added the application of individual curfew, the use of self-placed advertisements with photographs of the offender in newspapers which circulate in the neighbourhood of the offender, with a confession of the offence.  Such a system has had effect for certain serious traffic offences, for example, in the United States.</P>
    <P>I also advocate the holding of parents responsible in part for the actions of their juvenile children who are constant offenders &mdash; I emphasise the words &ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; and &ldquo;constant&rdquo;.  If one of my children was a juvenile offender on a constant basis I would expect to be brought before the courts and asked where I was when the child was offending. If a curfew was placed on my child &mdash; in some cases the court orders that children be at home at certain times &mdash; I would fully expect, as a parent, to be told to be at home with the child.  It is time parents took responsibility for the actions of their children.</P>
    <P>Six hundred and ninety-five persons in places of detention &mdash; approximately 31 per cent of the population of persons in detention &mdash; are juveniles between the ages of 14 and 17 years, and the maintenance cost is approximately £26 million per annum.  Meanwhile resources cannot <Col N="197" /> be found for adequate remedial education and 9.9 per cent of the juvenile school population in Dublin on any one day are mitching.  According to the McBride report, it costs about £5,000 to incarcerate a youth for three months for the theft of £500.</P>
    <P>Those who seek reform of the system are often dismissed as bleeding hearts or do-gooders.  Before dismissing the argument for reform we must ask ourselves if any other system has been efficient, effective or economical.  Most prisoners come from deprived backgrounds and neighbourhoods.  Fine Gael believes in equality of opportunity; every person counts.  We do not believe that people can be made equal since each individual has his or her own talents.  Equal opportunity, however, is a different matter. For most prisoners, and whole sections of the community, access to third level education is not even a consideration.  It is not on the agenda and their opportunities, therefore, are limited.</P>
    <P>The housing conditions for many of those who go on to form the prison population are among the poorest in the country. That is not to stigmatise those who come from poor housing conditions as criminal but if there are 10,000 local authority flats, for example, situated between the canals in Dublin, in need of major refurbishment, it is inevitable that that poor housing environment will produce a proportionately greater number of people who are alienated from the system and who do not consider themselves part of a normal or fair society.</P>
    <P>If we are to give people equality of opportunity we must put the refurbishment of housing stock at the top of the agenda and open third level education to all as a realistic objective.  This is not to excuse prisoners for their behaviour, they must take responsibility for what they have done.  If the system is to be effective, however, it must address the causes of crime and ensure that the cure is a real one and not a costly cosmetic exercise which pulls the wool over the eyes of the public.  At present, the prison system is contributing to the problem rather than contributing to the solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> As part of a prison reform policy and philosophy, Fine Gael believes that prison staff and management should work closely in co-operation.  Good industrial relations are essential and for this reason staff should be properly trained and constantly retrained and should be involved in regular consultations on how the system is made to work.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Fine Gael discussion document on prison reform issued some weeks ago is to put the reform of the prisons centre stage and to initiate a public debate on an informed basis so that this central ingredient in the criminal justice system is made to work and is seen to work.  We have made a number of recommendations and I ask the Minister to accept them.  This discussion document is not perfect, it was put together jointly by the Fine Gael Front Bench and Young Fine Gael in an exercise aimed at putting this question centre stage.  We would welcome constructive comments and criticisms of it but if most of what is contained in it is implemented, it will go a long way towards bringing about a reform of the prison system and contributing to a downturn in crime.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the need for the reform of the court's system, another vital ingredient in the reform of the criminal justice system to enable it to deal with the problems of the 1990s.  A rationalisation of the District Court system is long overdue.  We have heard nothing of the promise in the Programme for Government to establish a judicial commission, comprising the presidents of the courts and the Attorney General, to examine court management.  Could it be that the Government partners have had a rethink about this promise?</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this proposal because it states that judges should have a view on the management of the courts and the streamlining of court services.  Judges are not the people to make such decisions. Their expertise is in the area of law, not in the area of administration.  Why should the presidents of the courts be involved with the Attorney General in a matter <Col N="199" /> for which they have no qualifications or competence?  They should be asked for their views but a judicial commission should not be established.  We should have an agency to administer the courts, similar to the practice in Northern Ireland and Britain.  There should be no more commissions or reviews and we should certainly not have a judicial commission. I am appalled that, given the state of the court system, nothing has been done over the past 18 months to deal with the urgent problems that exist.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I put before this House a ten point plan which was dismissed out of hand by the Government. The Government may have thought at that time that I would go away; I will not go away.  I will continue to campaign for law and order, for efficiency and effectiveness in the system and for a fair system, not one which, when it is caught in a form of malpractice, the Government arrogantly and smartly tries to justify.  It should have the good grace to admit that what was done was wrong and that the malpractice will cease.</P>
    <P>The ten point plan I put forward included the need to measure the true level of crime.  The crime statistics do not measure the true level of crime, only the level of reported crime.  I have prepared a Bill to deal with that and I have put forward proposals in a detailed document &mdash; we were the only party in this House to do so &mdash; on how we should reform the prison system.  I have argued also for the reform of the courts and the need for an agency to do so, not a commission of judges.  I put forward an argument for greater co-operation and the creation of a drugs enforcement agency, the drug problem being the centre of all our crime.</P>
    <P>I have argued for greater accountability for the DPP in given circumstances because I do not accept that cases which are not prosecuted, some involving loss of life, should be unexplained.  I do not wish to interfere with the independence of the DPP but some method should be found to make him accountable.  In Britain, the Attorney General is a Member of Parliament who must answer <Col N="200" /> to Parliament and who can be questioned. There is no such person in this House and that represents a yawning gap in our system.  Without interfering with his independence, the DPP should be accountable in certain circumstances.  If one of our loved ones was killed in a car accident from which no prosecution ensued, nobody would explain to us the reason for this.  There is no accountability and I find that wholly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We must have value for the £550 million which is spent annually on the criminal justice system.  I recommended to this House that the Comptroller and Auditor General be asked to carry out an audit of the way fees are paid out to lawyers, barristers, solicitors and various consultants. The public see that for the scandal that it is.  Why have we not conferred those powers on the Comptroller and Auditor General?  He might well be asked to carry out a full value for money audit of the whole criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I want to see the confiscation of assets of criminals.  The necessary legislation has been passed but when will it be implemented?  When will the criminals feel the pain of having their assets confiscated? There should be more gardaí on the beat.  The number should be brought up to what it was when we left office, with the possibility of an increase.  I cannot and will not accept a situation where the Garda is undermanned by 500.</P>
    <P>There must be parental accountability for regular juvenile offenders.  I would fully expect to be asked to account for my whereabouts if my child was out on the street on a regular basis.  I am not suggesting we should compel judges to adopt a particular course but parents should be involved in some way.  There should also be restrictions, for instance, on the sale of hunting knives.  Over the past 12 months in my constituency two young men have lost their lives in separate incidents involving the use of these knives.</P>
    <P>I see a breakdown in law and order, a cavalier attitude to crime and a situation which is wholly unacceptable.  With my party I will continue to raise this matter in <Col N="201" /> the House until law and order is restored. The Minister will discover sooner or later that the public do not accept bland assurances; they want action and they are not getting it from the Government.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the motion I will respond to some of the allegations made <Col N="202" /> by Deputy Mitchell.  It is a pity he should have decided, in a display of opportunism which was breathtaking even coming from that quarter, to seek to use the context of understandable and genuine public concern at recent tragic events to launch a personal attack on the manner in which I discharge my responsibilities as Minister for Justice.  He seems to be playing on public fears solely for electioneering purposes and the Sunday night sound bite.</P>
    <P>I do not have the slightest objection to criticism of the manner in which I discharge those responsibilities.  That is part and parcel of political life but I object to the Deputy coming in here, day in day out, abusing the Order of Business to cast smears and innuendoes which he is well aware the rules of the House do not allow me to respond to at that time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seems to regard the exercise of my statutory responsibilities as representing interference with the operation of the criminal justice system. Coming from someone who frequently asserts our rights as legislators he must have a most peculiar understanding of the role of the Executive when he regards the exercise by a Minister of the rights and duties conferred by the legislator as somehow representing unacceptable interference amounting to, in his words, &ldquo;political corruption&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how anyone, with the possible exception of the Deputy, could take such a proposition seriously. When the Deputy is preparing his next political quizbook he would be unwise, given his present lack of understanding, to attempt to include a section on constitutional or administrative law but a section on stunts and baseless allegations should be well within his competence. His most recent stunt, the chain letter writing exercise, is but the latest in a long line of such events.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies to anyone for exercising my statutory functions whether in relation to prisons or the location of Garda administrative headquarters. Is it seriously suggested that I should in some way ignore my personal knowledge when I make decisions, as <Col N="203" /> provided for in law, on issues affecting my constituency?  As regards the location of the Garda district headquarters it is not true, as has been suggested, that I acted in defiance of Garda advice.  In fact, a strong case was made to me by Garda management based on the crime statistics, population trends and general policing issues to the effect that it was a nonsense to have policing in Salthill and its hinterland directed from a less central location at a considerable remove from the main population centre in the Garda district.  Is it suggested that no effort should be made to match policing needs with the availability of resources?  Is the Deputy suggesting that policing in Crumlin and Drimnagh be directed from Naas, Dunboyne or Blessington?  He seems to be saying that because I corrected a similar type anomaly I stepped outside my ministerial responsibility.  If the Deputy wants to make a case to me to do something like this I am sure his constituents in Crumlin and Drimnagh will be appreciative.</P>
    <P>As for my so called interference in the running of the prisons and my personal interest in prisoners from Galway, am I to detach myself from my personal knowledge or exorcise my mind of this information when decisions are being made about these prisoners?  Of course I look at these and other cases.  To do otherwise would be a dereliction of duty on my part.</P>
    <P>So as to put the Deputy's mind fully at ease, my actions in this respect are not without precedent.  If the Deputy is putting it about that this is a new departure on my part I suggest he consult beforehand with some of his colleagues not a million miles from home.  They might put him right and save him some embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seems to think I should be accountable to the House for the manner in which I discharge my statutory responsibilities which, of course, I am but that it somehow represents interference when I see to discharge those responsibilities. The House will be aware of the dangers of power without responsibility <Col N="204" /> but most Members would accept there would be equal difficulty with the Deputy's advocacy of the novel concept of responsibility without power.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more I could say on the subject and if the Deputy wishes to pursue charges of interference it might be best to start a little closer to home.  I will offer him one piece of advice: he should not be misled by recent media reports where particular views were attributed to so-called sources within my Department.  It might be helpful if I mention in this context that I accept the Deputy is free to seek advice from whatever quarter he wishes but he should be wary of those who, under the entirely false pretext of having access to current information and a proper understanding of the operation of the criminal justice system, may in reality be rooted in the past, working through a personal and very worn agenda.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House identifies a number of issues in the law and order field which I propose to address.  Before I do so, it is necessary to address what I consider to be the central proposition in the motion, that is, that law and order in this State no longer exists.  That is the only reasonable inference one can draw from the Deputy's call on the Government to &ldquo;restore law and order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nobody that I know of would seriously try to pretend that the incidence of crime and the viciousness and callousness displayed in the course of particular criminal acts is not a problem.  It is and has been a problem for quite some time now, particularly over the past ten to 15 years, but it is a problem in practically every country in the world and is far more serious in most western countries than here.</P>
    <P>I do not say this with the aim of suggesting that because the situation is generally worse elsewhere we really have nothing to worry about on the crime front and, therefore, we can all simply relax our guard.  That would be a bogus argument.</P>
    <P>I have two principal reasons for making the comparison with other countries, the first being to remind ourselves that we are dealing with a world-wide phenomenon <Col N="205" /> and that we need, therefore, to look a little more deeply at causes and possible solutions.  We need to reflect on the fact that other countries, many far wealthier than ours, have poured massive resources into policing and prison systems but despite the commitment of such resources, there is constant pressure for more and more.  This pressure is generated by criminals who are growing in viciousness and sophistication.  We need to ask ourselves why this is happening and whether we have the appropriate strategies in place to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that we should suddenly move away from what might be called the traditional approaches &mdash; firmer laws, adequate police and court resources and effective custodial and non-custodial disposals.  It would be nonsensical to take that course and Deputies will be aware that I have placed considerable emphasis on these areas since I became Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>We must try other approaches also. Some of these were outlined in the Report of the Interdepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder, the implementation of which is ongoing. That report made the point that, &ldquo;a degree of experimentation with new approaches is not only warranted but is something the public, who ultimately meet the costs, are entitled to expect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is with this in mind that the Government has significantly upped the level of resources available for certain community based schemes such as GRAFT in Ronanstown and KEY in Killinarden in Dublin, the operation of which I shall outline later.</P>
    <P>My second reason for making a comparison with other countries is to caution against overstatement of the problems we face.  This is still, thankfully, a far safer country to visit and live in than most others and we should bear in mind that the consequences of suggesting that law and order has virtually disappeared are quite serious in terms of unwarranted risk to tourism, business opportunities and employment.  Only yesterday I heard German visitors being interviewed on radio following a criminal incident in one <Col N="206" /> of our towns in which a tourist was the victim and it was quite heartening to note that, despite the incident, they were still of the view that Ireland was an excellent place to visit and stay in and that they neither suffered any gloom nor dark forebodings about the present state or future of our law and order system.  I am not for a moment suggesting that attacks on tourists and other offences of that kind are a matter of no consequence &mdash; far from it.  My point is that we must not fall into the trap of overstatement.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be both stupid and insensitive in the extreme not to acknowledge that five killings in recent times, four in the west and one last Saturday night in Dublin, have cast a particularly dark shadow which forms the backdrop to today's debate.  It is understandable in the immediate aftermath of these appalling events, that there would not only be great anguish but also the people would become more concerned about personal safety.  It would be wrong, however, to conclude that these extremely serious events &mdash; each of which is being pursued by the gardaí with utmost vigour and commitment &mdash; signal the emergence in Irish life of a pattern of behaviour which we can all now expect as a sort of norm.</P>
    <P>I trust Deputies will not seek to create undue anxiety or panic by attempting to hang an argument that law and order has broken down on the fact that these tragic events have recently been visited upon us.  That would be an irresponsible course to take which is why I cautioned in this House earlier today in relation to Saturday night's attack in a licensed premises, which has the potential to cause particular anxiety, on the need for people generally to avoid panic but to exercise reasonable care and vigilance in going about their normal business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made the point that there are insufficient Garda resources to control the Border and prevent terrorist type attacks on premises in Dublin.  This is patently not the case.  The gardaí saw the vehicle which was involved in the incident last Saturday night.  The resources were on the street in the form of uniformed and plain clothes gardaí.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> They did their job.  The problem is that technology let them down and it was not a question of lack of resources as the Deputy suggested.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice my main areas of concern embrace elements of the criminal justice system.  By that I mean the criminal law; questions of policing policy so far as the Garda Síochána is concerned; the control and administration of the prisons system and last, but not least, particular aspects of courts administration.  The criminal justice system today is at the forefront of the protection of our society and the interplay between its various constituent elements and society itself is most complex.</P>
    <P>At this time there is also great concern among the ordinary public about crime, particularly violent crime, in our society. This is a worldwide phenomenon that is not just confined to Ireland, and there are no magic solutions or quick fix strategies that will suddenly reverse crime trends. Public concern focuses particularly on offences perpetrated against the more vulnerable members of our society, the elderly living alone and women and children. I am acutely conscious of these concerns, first, in my role as a public representative where I come into contact on a regular basis with victims of crime and, second, as Minister for Justice where I have the particular role of being involved at the cutting edge of the response to crime.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that the causes of most of the crime with which we are concerned are complex.  Unemployment and the associated twin evils of economic and financial deprivation are relevant in any intelligent discussion of why people are turning to crime in increasing numbers. Perhaps these factors, while not by themselves causing crime, play a part in making criminal activity more tempting to certain sections of society.  However, it requires more than simply temptation for people to turn to crime; it also requires a lack of inhibition or, put another way, a lack of moral guidance. There has been a dramatic and marked <Col N="208" /> diminution in the traditional authority sources &mdash; family, school and church &mdash; over recent generations.  It is reasonable to question whether too much is being expected of the criminal justice system in the search for solutions.  Is it being expected to fill a role for which it was not designed?</P>
    <P>We also need to look in other directions if we are to find more complete answers.  We need greater community involvement in our search for these answers.  This can have dramatic effects on crime in particular areas.  We know of the very positive results of increased awareness of crime prevention measures such as the Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes.  The success of these schemes has led to parallel operations in the business area.  I will refer more fully to the role of crime prevention later, but first I want to refer to other areas of direct concern to me.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to giving the Garda, the courts and the Prison Service the necessary resources to tackle crime in all its forms.  As some Deputies may be aware, last December I announced details of a three year programme package of law and order measures to be implemented in the years 1994-97 at an overall cost of £66 million. That programme includes the taking on of extra gardaí in 1994 to keep the strength of the Force at 11,000.  This involves bringing forward by one year the four year recruitment campaign originally begun in 1992 and due to end in 1995.  This means that this year the number of gardaí recruited will be double what it would ordinarily have been &mdash; in all a total of 407 will be recruited.</P>
    <P>During the period 1995-97 1,050 gardaí will be recruited to maintain the force at its current optimum level.  That will mean an annual intake of 350 per year in each of those years.  This recruitment process has already begun.</P>
    <P>There is also a commitment to the ongoing process of civilianisation in the Garda Síochána.  A further 200 civilians will be recruited for each of the years 1995-97 at the rate of 50 per year.  This is the way forward to get gardaí away from <Col N="209" /> desks and out onto the streets of our cities and towns for operational duties &mdash; the duties for which they were recruited and trained.  While these jobs are clerical and administrative in nature, I also am in the process of beginning the recruitment of civilians to slot in at management level in the force to fill senior positions. Also, the adoption of an information technology plan for the force will mean the recruitment of additional highly qualified civilian personnel.</P>
    <P>A modern effective police force needs to have the most up-to-date technological aids.  My plan allows for the phased implementation of a comprehensive IT plan for the force in line with the Garda Commissioner's corporate strategy plan presented to me last year.  In tandem with this work, the entire Garda communications network is to be upgraded.  In this day and age, a modern police force has to be mobile and able to depend on its transport.  The plan approaches the whole question of fleet management in a structured way and ensures that the gardaí will have the vehicles they need for all the varied aspects of their work.</P>
    <P>Closed circuit television monitoring is becoming more prevalent in society today.  We are all used to seeing the cameras in shops, filling stations and banks. We also see the benefits of this technology as an aid to policing in programmes such as the &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; television series.  Closed circuit television is extremely successful in identifying criminals and it has a huge deterrent effect.  My plan provides for the phased introduction of close circuit television technology in two areas of Dublin &mdash; the city centre and the Temple Bar area. When we have evaluated its effectiveness, we will consider the extension of this initiative to other areas.</P>
    <P>I will also be implementing certain proposals of the Advisory Committee on Fraud in relation to staffing structures in the Garda Fraud Squad.  The legal changes recommended by the committee are being worked on in my Department at present and I hope to publish a Bill updating our antiquated laws on dishonesty later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> I referred earlier to the importance of developing new approaches and strategies for tackling crime.  My Department has been to the forefront in recent years in funding community based projects which have as their aim the diversion of young people away from anti-social behaviour and petty crime.  This follows on from the conclusions in the 1992 report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Urban Crime and Disorder. My plans allows for the continuation of those initiatives channelled through the Garda to underscore the fact that gardaí are part of the communities in which they serve.  These projects, which can be highly cost effective, have been running now for some years in the north Clondalkin area of Dublin, in Ronanstown and Killinarden for example.  This year I approved of funding for community based schemes in Knocknaheeny-Hollyhill in Cork and Moyross in Limerick.</P>
    <P>This package of measures is not the end of the road in so far as the fight against crime is concerned.  I, more than most, know that the overall situation needs to be kept under constant review. It goes without saying that if we need further strategies or different responses I will be the first to pursue them.  I will also take account of what is said in the present debate on the subject of crime.  I do not have a closed mind about strategies that might be adopted.  I have only one precondition and that is that any proposals must be workable and fit in with an overall strategy.  I am not interested in proposals which have been raised before, considered and rejected, such as, for example, recruiting hundreds more gardaí or providing for an auxiliary police force.</P>
    <P>I will listen with particular interest to any contributions in relation to the community policing scheme in rural areas which has been much in the news recently in connection with the tragic events in Clare and Galway.  I have already said that any changes that are necessary in that scheme arising from Garda management's review of the scheme will be implemented.  I do not want to let this opportunity go by without nailing the lie <Col N="211" /> that community policing is not working because of the closure of Garda stations. The fact is that in the past 20 years not one Garda station has been closed.  The scheme is certainly different from what rural policing used to be about.  No longer do we have Garda stations open for 12 hours a day with no personal callers, with one garda sitting at a desk shuffling paperwork and answering the occasional telephone call.  Instead, stations open at particular times to transact such administrative business as is necessary and the gardaí who would otherwise be tied to desks are engaged in active and operational duties in the community, moving around in that community and getting to know all the people they serve. The scheme was evaluated in 1992 and again in 1993 by the Garda Commissioner and it will be looked at again this year.</P>
    <P>Another matter that comes up from time to time in discussions of this nature is Garda numbers.  It might help matters if I made a few things clear in that regard. Before the new training procedures came into force in 1989, it was the practice to include all garda trainees in the overall numbers of Garda strength.  That made sense because the formal training period was quite short &mdash; it only lasted six months.  However, following the Conroy report on Garda probationer training, a two year training programme was introduced after 1989.  To include garda trainees in overall Garda strength would have been misleading, so the practice now is to include only those trainees who have been attested as full gardaí.  On this basis, the present strength of the force is 10,884 gardaí in service, with 431 trainees of probationers in the pre-attesting phases.  The highest ever strength of the force was in December 1986 with 11,382 gardaí, including those in training.  The actual number of trainees at that time was 144.  To compare like with like, the total number now is 11,315.  I should also say that the projected Garda strength for 1994 is 10,908 members with around 400 further non-attested members in training. So much for the missing hundreds. But perhaps the most important point is <Col N="212" /> that the operational strength of the force has been increased by virtue of the release of desk-bound gardaí for operational duties as a direct consequence of civilianisation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about the drugs situation. We are all aware of the horrific effects of drug misuse and addiction not only on the drugs abuser but also on their unfortunate families and communities.  For this reason, I have targeted the drugs problem as one of my top priorities.</P>
    <P>I agree that quite an amount of crime affecting people in all areas is drug related, with addicts robbing and stealing to feed a habit.  From my ongoing meetings with the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers, I know that the Garda authorities also treat the problem with the highest priority and that the gardaí are having regular successes in detecting and prosecuting drug offences.  We read about these cases regularly in the media. It is the general international experience that law enforcement agencies succeed in detecting a small proportion of illegal drug imports only.  The Customs and the gardaí have had some notable successes in the past year in detecting and seizing illegal supplies of cannabis and heroin. Some of these operations involved close inter-agency co-operation.</P>
    <P>Clearly everything in our power should be done to counter the importation of illegal drugs.  A report has been prepared in my Department which aims to introduce further measures to maximise co-operation between various State agencies which have a role in the fight against drug smuggling.  I expect that the measures recommended in the report will be the subject of a memorandum for the Government.  After the necessary consultations have taken place between the agencies concerned, I am aiming to have the main measures recommended in the report implemented during the summer.</P>
    <P>A recurring criticism expressed in relation to the drugs problem is the level of resources and manpower to tackle the situation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  A Garda National Drug <Col N="213" /> Administration Office was established in 1990 with responsibility for co-ordination of national drug law enforcement and international liaison.  This unit is based at Garda Headquarters.  Drug squads are based at Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway while specialist units are also based at a number of other Garda district offices.</P>
    <P>The main drug of abuse in this country is cannabis resin, which accounts for about 75 per cent of all seizures of drugs. That said, I am also aware of the level of heroin abuse, particularly in the inner city areas, and of the catastrophic effects it can have.  It was for this reason that I recently availed of the opportunity to visit the south Dublin inner city area to view the situation at first hand.  I am confident that the Garda authorities have the situation in hand.  I wish to assure the House that there will be no shortfall in human and other resources needed in the all out campaign against this scourge.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House refers in particular to the increase in the level of armed robberies and an increase in the use of violence in crime.  As I have already mentioned, I am concerned at any incidence of crime but in particular acts of violence where armed force is used.  The Garda Commissioner is also concerned about this.  It was for this reason that he established a quick response unit in the Dublin metropolitan area last year to tackle the problem.  This unit has been particularly successful in not only foiling many planned raids by armed criminals but also in capturing criminals caught in the act of armed robberies. Central to the unit's success has been the gathering and pooling of intelligence and its abilty to respond quickly and without regard to Garda district or divisional boundaries.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to the finalisation and implementation of a new set of aims, objectives and agreed priorities for the prison system, including a programme of positive sentence management and a time table for the implementation of the Whitaker report on prison reform.</P>
    <P>With regard to the so-called &ldquo;revolving <Col N="214" /> door&rdquo; system and the penal system generally, I will be publishing a comprehensive five-year plan on the management of offenders within the next month.  That document will deal with many of the issues that have been raised in other debates and, no doubt, will be raised in this debate also.  In particular it will draw on the thrust of the Whitaker report; review the main recommendations of the Whitaker report and what we are doing about them; contain overall aims, priorities and objectives for the prison system; contain an action plan for the development of the system over the next five years, including the concept of positive sentence management; develop strategies for dealing with problem areas including drug abuse in prisons; and include new draft prison rules and a draft code of discipline for prison staff.  I am satisfied that my proposals represent a modern, progressive approach to the prison system.  I have started already to implement core elements of the policy document.</P>
    <P>Arising from my special examination of needs in the area of prison accommodation the Government has approved the provision of 210 additional prison places.  This new accommodation will include a purpose designed custodial facility to accommodate up to 60 female offenders.  The new prison facility to accommodate 150 male offenders will be located at the site of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, County Roscommon. Since action speaks louder than words I am delighted to inform the House that the contract has been placed for the first phase of the construction project &mdash; the building of the perimeter wall to secure the prison site &mdash; and that construction will be commenced by the end of this week.  Furthermore, I can assure the House that I will spare no effort to ensure that the next phase of the work is got under way as early as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am moving on the proposed new prison for women.  We have here a unique opportunity to get a purpose designed prison suited to the particular needs of female offenders.  I have appointed a special steering committee <Col N="215" /> to advise me on the design of the new prison and the committee is proceeding in its work with all speed.  As in the case of the new male prison, I will be getting on with construction as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the provision of extra spaces, it is our policy to develop community based sanctions for suitable offenders.  I am committed to finding a balance between the provision of custodial and community sanctions.  With this in mind, I unveiled a strategy for the next four years which involves the recruitment of an additional 50 probation and welfare officers and support staff at a full-year's cost of £2.4 million a year; 25 of these probation staff will be assigned to closely supervising offenders on early release from custody.  To back up this supervision, additional probation accommodation and day attendance facilities at a capital cost of £2.5 million are being provided.  This will allow us to develop a system whereby planned and programmed early releases under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service can be resorted to.  I have also obtained approval to fill 20 existing vacancies in the Probation Service this year; 13 of these staff will be assigned to the intensive supervision scheme.  This is where young serious offenders are referred by the courts as an alternative to custody or from prison at an early stage of sentence.  Offenders are intensively supervised and are challenged to confront their offending behaviour not just its causes but also its consequences on themselves, their families and their victims.</P>
    <P>This is a core element of the broadly based programme which also addresses occupation and educational deficits.  The response rate, measured by the numbers who remain crime-free since their last conviction and by the attendance and level of commitment to the programme, is approximately 75 per cent.  I am satisfied this programme is doing an effective job for us in reducing the number of repeat offenders among serious offenders.  Over 100 offenders are currently participating in the scheme and <Col N="216" /> this will be increased to close to 200 when the extra 13 staff are recruited. The total of 70 extra staff will represent an increase of over 40 per cent in the strength of the service by 1997 and counters any suggestion that my Department is not providing enough resources for the development of the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>Temporary release of sentenced prisoners may be granted by the Minister for Justice and is subject in all cases to certain conditions.  Before temporary release is granted regard is had to certain factors, including the nature of the offence, the length of sentence, the length of time served, behaviour while in custody and, above all, the safety of the public. Release will not be granted in any case where I consider, in the light of the advice available, that it would constitute a threat to the public.</P>
    <P>Where temporary release is granted it is always subject to conditions.  In all cases there is, not surprisingly, the condition that the person released must continue to be of good behaviour but various other conditions may also be applied in individual cases, for example, that the individual concerned would be subject to supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service, that he or she should report at regular intervals to a Garda station, reside at a particular location, etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any of these conditions is breached and the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings.  The system is a good one and an important part of my strategy for the future is to develop it as an element of positive sentence management.</P>
    <P>One of the more commonly-advanced suggestions that I think worth commenting on here and now is that our prisons are chock-a-block with minor offenders who should not really be in prison at all.  I have even heard it suggested that nobody convicted by the District Court should undergo a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of alternatives to custody, as will be evident from my forthcoming policy document.  Of <Col N="217" /> course, alternatives are already used to quite a significant extent but we need to bear in mind that all the alternatives have been tried time and time again with many offenders but with no apparent success.  With some offenders, alternatives work, and work very well, but not with others.</P>
    <P>We need to bear in mind also that the term &ldquo;minor&rdquo; offence does not signify that the occurrence which resulted in imprisonment was a trivial matter which was really of little or no consequence to anybody.  All it means in practice is that a lengthy term of imprisonment was not deemed appropriate.  However, we are not talking about people whose offence was that they pulled up the flowers in the village green.  The actual convictions may include joyriding, larcency, assault and so on &mdash; in other words, offences which usually have left distraught or injured victims.</P>
    <P>I asked my Department to make a random selection this morning of 20 offenders in Mountjoy currently serving sentences of six months or less.  I believe the results are quite instructive.  Fifteen of the 20 had served previous sentences. Of these six had served one previous sentence, one had two previous sentences, two had three previous sentences, five had four previous sentences, and one had five previous sentences.  Of the five who have not served a previous sentence two are serving sentences for assault, one for possession of drugs, one for trespass, larceny and malicious damage and one is serving a month-and-a-half for driving without insurance.  The offences in the cases of those who had previous sentences include extortion, possession of drugs and forging prescriptions, malicious damage, possession of dangerous weapons, assault, trespass and larceny, receiving and joyriding.  I am not saying that custody alternatives have no part to play in the management of these offenders.  My point is that, when prescribing appropriate remedies for so-called minor offenders, we should know <Col N="218" /> exactly what kind offenders we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the concerns which the Deputy raised regarding the courts system, I am, of course, very concerned that the courts provide an effective, efficient and accessible service.  There are a number of problems facing our courts today but they are being tackled.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of time available to me, I intend to conclude by saying that I know everything cannot be done at once. However, I believe that the measures taken already &mdash; about which I have spoken in detail &mdash; and other initiatives planned, represent a most comprehensive response to the problem of crime in our society.  They address the various aspects of the problem referred to in the motion before the House. Accordingly, I cannot accept the critical import of that motion.  Instead I would commend the amendment tabled in my name to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The random sample of prisoners in Mountjoy to which the Minister referred really proves the point raised in the House this evening, which is that our prison system is an abject failure since all the people to whom she referred had had previous convictions, in other words, were recidivists.  This is a key problem that must be tackled within the overall prison system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While supporting the Fine Gael motion, which highlights the level of concern in the community, I take the Minister's point that if we look at relative figures for other western economies our crime rate is not so high.  However, this is a small country and everybody hears of the latest crime against our neighbour. The perception that law and order has broken down is just as important as the <Col N="219" /> figures to which the Minister refers. Rather than engage in redundant and almost routine condemnation of the Government and of the upsurge in crime and lawlessness, the Progressive Democrats would prefer to be constructive and to table a worthwhile agenda which the Minister could take on board in the context of the five year plan.</P>
    <P>Our first proposal is the establishment of a modern and effective criminal code. Almost every other common law jurisdiction operates on the basis of a criminal code, in which all the ordinary criminal law is set out in one statute.  There are many models and precedents for Ireland to choose from and to develop.  All that is missing is a criminal law review committee to get on with the task.  In this context, the valuable work done by the Law Reform Commission must be acknowledged but there is no reason to believe that the commission has the resources or the mandate to accomplish such a task.  On the contrary, other tasks facing the commission suggest that codification of the criminal law, as the Whitaker report on the penal system suggested, should be entrusted to a specialist criminal law reform committee. It is wrong to criticise the gardaí and at the same time ignore the appallingly out dated laws which they are supposed to enforce.  There has been a degree of unwarranted criticism of the excellent men and women in the Garda Síochána. Maintaining morale is critical if they are to continue to fight the perceived increase in crime, particularly violent crime, in the State.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Law Reform Commission is currently conducting a review of the law on bail.  It is not, apparently, engaged in preparing recommendations for a change.  Short of a referendum, the Progressive Democrats believe that the widespread abuse of bail could be tackled by making a bailsman liable to forfeit bail if the accused commits any offence while on bail.  At present <Col N="220" /> he is only liable to forfeit bail if the accused absconds.  By making bailsmen liable as sureties for the good behaviour of the accused, as well as failure to turn up for trial, the State could prevent an abuse of bail.  The amount of bail in such circumstances could reflect the criminal propensities of the accused without prejudicing his right to a fair trial.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that our present law on bail is too lax and the changes made in 1984 to require mandatory consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail, while of some value, are clearly not enough.  If the statutory changes proposed above to modify bail law are implemented, a referendum may still be necessary.  The people are demanding that some significant changes be put in place and believe they are right. It is generally recognised among the legal profession that the bail laws need to be changed.</P>
    <P>There is a need to speed up the criminal justice system to deal with the problems highlighted this evening.  There is no need for the present scandalous delays in criminal procedures.  Summary offences are commonly dealt with six to 12 months after the event because of court listing problems.  Appeals for summary convictions frequently take another six months.  This is the Minister's responsibility and I urge her to reform the courts system which needs to be updated urgently.  Trials on indictment normally take place 12 to 18 months after the events charged.  This delay is also the Minister's responsibility.  People on remand are clogging up the system by being put into Mountjoy and causing those who have been convicted of serious crimes to be released.  That revolving door, which has now become a sad cliché of the system, must be tackled.  In that sense I should like to refer to the prison system.</P>
    <P>Our prisons should be places not only of detention but of discipline and creative and productive work, which is part and parcel of rehabilitation.  Like Deputy <Col N="221" /> Mitchell I refer to the annual reports of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee for 1992 and 1993.  The 1992 report identified Mountjoy as a potential volcano.  The committee also recognised the limits to their own powers.  All they can do is make recommendations and file a report.  They feel that perhaps they are not being listened to.  They make excellent recommendations, many of which are simple and could be easily implemented.  For example, they recommend that there should be separate accommodation for remand prisoners rather than putting them in among hardened criminals.  In both reports the visiting committee homed in on the fact that 80 per cent of our prison population do nothing all day. There is no incentive for them to partake in any of the activities which are available to prisoners.  There is an excellent educational programme as well as various gym options but the reality is that 80 per cent take the easy option &mdash; inactivity. The report cites human setaside where prisoners are left to rot, to do nothing, to wait for their next fix and do not participate in any of the options geared towards rehabilitation and activity.  It states:</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the Easy Option (Inactivity) is the one which is not only Full Time, but that for which about 80% of the prisoners elect.  There is incentive only for Full Time idle social intercourse where effort goes unrewarded. Prisoners require goals.  For those who would participate the incentive is not offered.  Despite the best intentions and often superhuman effort on the part of teachers, governors and prison staff most prisoners in Mountjoy are permitted to let time hang heavily on their hands.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to quantify the extent to which the drugs and HIV problems in Mountjoy are being cultivated by daily aimless inactivity.</P>
    <P>If the taxpayer is to foot the bill of £600 per week for each prisoner in Mountjoy <Col N="222" /> we should expect them to work.  Why should they work when there is no incentive to do so?  Some prisoners opt for the gym because it means they get an extra shower per week while others opt for various activities, such as community work projects outside the prison on a supervised daily temporary release basis. Simple incentives work.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive assessment is needed as well as an audit of our prison population. There should be a plan for each prisoner and, as Deputy Mitchell said, they all have their individual human rights as prisoners.  A programme of work should be drawn up for each prisoner who should be made work.  There should also be a disciplined atmosphere in a prison.</P>
    <P>When I visited the women's prison at Mountjoy recently I was amazed that most of the women were between 18 and 24 years of age and 75 per cent IV drug abusers.  They were hanging around with nothing to do, waiting for the next fix.  Is it a good idea to put these women in jail given that it costs a fortune to keep them there?  We intend to build a specialist wing to house 60 women prisoners despite the fact that there are only 38 to 40 women in prison at any one time, the vast majority of whom are wrecks in terms of motivation and victims in many other ways.  They are in prison for petty offences, including shoplifting, to feed their drug habit.</P>
    <P>We should think carefully before we spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money building a state of the art women's prisons which will not meet the needs of inmates, particularly the specific needs of drug addicts.  The Minister sent a delegation to another jurisdiction to see how they deal with women offenders who, in the main, are not in prison for violent or serious offences but for petty offences such as shoplifting.  If a disciplined work programme was introduced in our prisons we would go along way towards tackling the inactivity which leads to a temptation <Col N="223" /> to get involved in drugs, with the heightened danger of suicide.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, needs to be reformed urgently to end the practice of taking the evidence of every witness down in handwriting under the deposition procedures when the accused so demands.  This procedure is being abused by hardened criminals to delay and avoid criminal sentencing.  It should be possible to circumvent the District Court procedure by allowing the prosecution to serve a book of evidence without the right, except in rare cases, to a written deposition.</P>
    <P>Recent events in Clare have shown &mdash; I have already highlighted this legal loophole&mdash; that a person sent forward for trial in custody on one offence is immune from any power of interrogation or from any obligation to provide scientific samples in connection with different offences while in custody.  This is of major significance and has been known for many years but nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that because of avoidable delays in serious appeals persons convicted on indictment of major offences cannot be confident of appealing the verdict to the Court of Criminal Appeal within 18 months.  This is another scandal and the responsibility lies with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern in the House about petitions for remission of sentences under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  My party believes that the Minister should be required, in every case where a sentence is remitted, to publish this fact in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Even if the identity of the person concerned should be kept secret in some cases the fact should be a matter of public record. The power of remission and parole should be exercised on the advice of a properly constituted paroles and remissions board.  There is growing concern, particularly in the legal profession, that there is insufficient or no consultation with the judges who impose sentences. <Col N="224" /> Sentences and fines are remitted in a secretive atmosphere and this is not in the public interest.  Often sentences are remitted where the appeals procedure has not been completed.  Many people believe that this undermines the justice system and constitutes an abuse of Executive power.</P>
    <P>On the subject of temporary release to which the Minister referred, this device is being used to disguise the fact that offenders now serve between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of their sentence on average and sometimes much less.  This abuse of temporary release by the State must be curtailed.  Many serious crimes are committed by people on temporary release from prison.  In future its use should be fully documented and supervised by a paroles and remissions board established under statute.</P>
    <P>Extra prison space is urgently required.  As things stand, the system only works by releasing convicted prisoners prematurely.  If an accused is remanded in custody a convicted prisoner is released to make room for him.  This is a crazy system and cause dismay among the general public.  It means that the guilty are released to make room for those who are still presumed innocent. The new facilities at Wheatfield and Castlerea may be adequate to deal with the problem.  Extra prisons cost money but if the cost was compared to that of crime the argument would be in favour of building adequate prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is a drug problem in our major prisons, particularly in Mountjoy.  Our jails are centres for drug abuse, recidivism and despair.  I call on the Minister to deal with this issue.  Drug addicts account for 30 per cent of the prison population and 75 per cent of female prisoners.</P>
    <P>As far as the criminal procedure is concerned, my party believes that it should be possible for a court in relation to the unqualified right to silence to draw an adverse inference from the failure of an accused to answer questions put to him in fair and controlled circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> In particular the formal questioning of persons detained on serious offences before district judges should be considered. If someone refused to answer questions in those circumstances the onus would be on that person to explain the silence to a court of trial.  The present law which allows serious offenders to escape justice by &ldquo;singing dumb&rdquo; is no longer acceptable in a society where crime is prevalent and sophisticated.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats also believe that we should compensate the victims of crime.  In a society dominated by over zealous litigants and by &ldquo;compensationists&rdquo; the Minister has a responsibility to provide modest compensation to the weakest section of the community &mdash; the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>The Government referred to a juvenile justice Bill; we need that Bill now, not talk.  There is a need for proper resources for the supervision and detention of juvenile offenders but, so far, we have been given promises and nothing else.  As the Minister said, juveniles account for 31 per cent of the total prison population. With the increase in youth homelessness and drug addiction this figure is bound to increase.  We need alternatives to detention for juvenile offenders.</P>
    <P>We need modern laws; more judges; courts that deal with offenders promptly; prompt appeals; speedy trial procedures; fair and transparent parole and remissions; workable bail laws and action on the part of a complacent Government. The reason the Government is complacent on a range of issues is that it is never pushed to the wire by the threat of a vote.  The Minister should outline her proposals for change in all these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that she will provide increased resources for the Probation and Welfare Service.  I do not know who to believe because last week IMPACT, the union which represents workers in the Probation and Welfare Service, indicated that the service is &ldquo;facing collapse&rdquo;.  It highlighted the crisis in the service and stated that more careful use of custody <Col N="226" /> could end prison overcrowding and the so-called revolving door syndrome.  It called for expanded community service schemes, drug addiction programmes and intensive probation schemes which would take the pressure off the country's jam-packed prison system.  There is discontent both in our Garda and among the probation service.  The Minister is failing to tackle the quite but slowly festering industrial dispute in the Garda which has come to a head this week.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not seen fit to intervene and appoint a mediator in that dispute.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 473,000 voters in the constituency of Leinster.  The tragedy in Rwanda is similar to wiping out every one of those voters in a period of six or seven weeks.  That may be a trivial example, but I am trying to bring home to us the enormity and horror of the tragedy that has occurred in Rwanda and neighbouring countries. Approximately 500,000 people are estimated to have been, killed in a brutal fashion.  It is with horror, shame and disgust that the people of this country read of people being told that they can have their lives ended by a gunshot wound or be hacked to death by a machete.  The De La Salle brother, Tom O'Donoghue, told the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that as he got on a plane to be taken to safety out of Rwanda a Tutsi sister knelt on the tarmac and begged those leaving to shoot members of her order in the head so that they would not have to face what was awaiting them. They had witnessed the horrific murders and killings and knew the same would happen them if they were caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote from a letter which a constituent <Col N="227" /> in Tralee sent to Deputy Deenihan.  She stated:</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that the Security Council should decide to withdraw all but 270 of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda at a time when the country is experiencing a human rights crisis of a kind hardly ever witnessed before. There should be action from the Security Council to stop the human rights violations.</P>
    <P>She want on to state:</P>
    <P>We can never make the excuse that we did not know that this carnage was taking place.  What sort of international community is it that can watch while innocent, men, women and children are cut down in horrendous massacres? Please do what you can.</P>
    <P>We cannot pretend that we do not know what has happened and is continuing to happen in Rwanda.  Many thousands of bodies have been washed into lakes and rivers of neighbouring countries.  Imagine the horror of seeing thousands of massacred and mutilated human bodies floating in front of our eyes in a lake in County Tipperary or elsewhere.  This is unbelievable. The horror is so awful that we blind ourselves to it because we cannot comprehend this type of inhumanity by one human to another.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that the Minister raised the issue at the Council of Development Ministers and the Tánaiste raised it at the Council of Ministers last Monday, we are not making our voice heard at international fora of which we are are members.  Will the Minister go to the United Nations tomorrow and make his voice heard to ensure that this massacre and slaughter ends?</P>
    <P>A recent report from Oxfam stated:</P>
    <P>The scale and brutality of the violence now taking place in Rwanda makes this the most appalling slaughter anywhere in the world today.  Thousands of lives are being lost every day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> In Oxfam's experience, this is the worst humanitarian crisis since the killing fields of Cambodia in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>We need to be reminded of what is taking place because, unfortunately, many other conflicts throughout the world are taking some of the attention from this tragedy.  I am concerned that the media will soon tire of this story and it will disappear from our television screens, radio and newspaper headlines and people will have to ask the name of the country where the 500,000 people were killed in six or seven weeks.  We should not allow ourelves to forget what is happening in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister tonight the motion of the joint committee which was passed and adopted on 11 May 1994.  It spells out clearly the concerns of that committee and calls on the Government to take a leading role in regard to humanitarian aid.  I acknowledge that a considerable amount of money has been sent through Concern, Oxfam, GOAL and other agencies who have gone out to help in Ngara where there are 300,000 refugees. I spoke to a member of Concern today and asked how the people in the camps are faring.  He told me that they are the lucky ones, they are out and alive. Life is not great for them, but they have a life.  That reminded me of all those who are locked in football stadia and churches guarded by people waiting for an opportunity to kill them.  They are depending on us in the rest of the world to make their voices heard.  If the Minister postpones all other matters on his desk to deal with this matter he will be thanked by the people of Rwanda and the neighbouring countries.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this very serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the killing of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi on 6 April last, Rwanda and its people have had to endure a human rights tragedy of unprecedented dimensions.  Hundreds of thousands <Col N="229" /> of civilians &mdash; perhaps half a million people &mdash; have been killed, many of them after the most appalling mutilation and torture.  Thousands have disappeared. Millions have been forced to flee their homes to seek refuge elsewhere in Rwanda or in neighbouring countries. Disease and hunger threaten the lives of those who have, so far, avoided death.</P>
    <P>The intensity and savagery of the slaughter over the past seven weeks has no parallels in recent history.  Rwanda has become a wasteland of death.</P>
    <P>We had Nazi Germany 50 years ago, Pol Pot's Cambodia just 15 years ago and we have Rwanda today.  In our own time this is a damning litany of man's inhumanity to man.  We cannot again, and we must not, abdicate our responsibilities to our fellow man when confronted by such horror.  We cannot say we do not know about it.  We know only too well.  All of us have seen, and none of us will forget, the images of the bloated bodies washed down the rivers to Lake Victoria from Rwanda's killing fields.</P>
    <P>Fighting between the forces of the Rwandese Government and the Rwandese Patriotic Front is continuing even though both sides have expressed their willingness to enter into a ceasefire. Government forces control the west and south-western parts of Rwanda while the RPF is in control of the northern and eastern parts of the country.  The capital, Kigali, is divided between the two sides but yesterday the airport fell to the RPF forces.</P>
    <P>Attacks on defenceless civilians continue throughout the country, especially in areas under the control of the armed forces of the Rwandese Government. There are reports that discipline in the RPF is breaking down and that reprisals against the members of the Hutu tribe are beginning.</P>
    <P>The Government has already condemned the fighting and the slaughter as an affront to everything we stand for and to the international system of order and justice for which we work.  We have said <Col N="230" /> that the crisis there calls for the highest level of co-ordinated action by the international community.  We have sought to bring about such action within the UN and the European Union.  The Tánaiste asked that the crisis in Rwanda be placed on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council on 16-17 May.  As a result of this the conflict was considered by the Foreign Ministers of the Union and the main lines of the Union's policy were set out in a declaration issued after the meeting.  The agreement reached at the Council reflects the key points of Ireland's policy.  Those key points include the following.  Ireland supports a review by the UN Security Council of the size and mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR).  That has been carried out.</P>
    <P>On 17 May the Security Council agreed to increase the size of UNAMIR and expanded its mandate.  The UN Secretary General has sent his special envoy and chief military advisers to Rwanda to consult the parties on all aspects of UNAMIR's expanded mandate.  Ireland supports the mission to Rwanda and Burundi by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The High Commissioner has visited Rwanda and I am arranging for a copy of his report to be placed in the Dáil Library.  Ireland supports an emergency meeting in Geneva of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  A two-day meeting began today.</P>
    <P>While we are not currently a member of the Commission, an Irish delegation will attend as observers.  Ireland's delegation is playing an active part in the European Union's contribution to the meeting.  At today's meeting the Union will support a recommendation to appoint a special rapporteur who will examine all aspects of the human rights tragedy in Rwanda. Ireland supports the proposal that future UN efforts aimed at conflict resolution and peace-building in Rwanda should contain a strong human rights component. Such a proposal will need an effective and comprehensive human <Col N="231" /> rights technical assistance programme. Ireland supports a UN Security Council arms embargo on Rwanda.  This has now been implemented by a Security Council Resolution.  Ireland made a proposal, endorsed by EU Foreign Ministers last week, that troika of EU Development Ministers make an early visit to the countries neighbouring Rwanda to evaluate the humanitarian position.  As I stated at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I initiated this proposal at the last EU Development Council meeting.</P>
    <P>The Declaration commits the European Union to increasing its humanitarian aid to the stricken population within Rwanda and to refugees in neighbouring countries.  It expresses appreciation and support for the efforts of the OAU and to President Muinee of Tanzania for their initiatives in convening a regional conference, to which both the authorities of Rwanda and the RPF will be invited.</P>
    <P>So far Ireland has contributed £547,000 to the humanitarian relief effort.  Most of this money has been channelled through Concern and Trócaire with donations also being made to Oxfam Ireland and World Vision Ireland.  Most of the funding is going towards assisting refugees in Tanzania where according to UNHCR there are now 310,000 Rwandans in camps.  Ireland has also given £100,000 to the Red Cross for its work in Rwanda. We are ready to commit further funds to these and other agencies as the position demands.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 11 May, we have investigated the possibility of funding being made available from the Irish aid programme to upgrade the airstrip at Ngara in Tanzania, where there are some 280,000 refugees.  After examination by an Irish aid team on the spot, it was concluded that the upgrading of the airstrip at Ngara is not an immediate priority for the agencies as the emphasis is being placed on meeting the needs of <Col N="232" /> the camps by road and rail on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>There are more pressing needs.  The camp at Ngara is extremely overcrowded, and it will be necessary to move people to new semi-permanent camps with full water and sanitation facilities.  The Government has offered to divert experts from our programme of development cooperation in Tanzania to help with this work, if this would be of direct assistance. We are discussing with the aid agencies what the most pressing priorities are and have informed them that we will respond sympathetically to their proposals.  I met some NGOs today to discuss their priorities.</P>
    <P>My impression is that the international agencies and NGOs are working very well together and that the immediate needs of refugees in Tanzania will be met.  The more difficult stage of the humanitarian effort lies ahead as order is hopefully restored in Rwanda.  At present the security position is making it very difficult for the agencies to deliver humanitarian assistance within Rwanda, but no one can doubt that, once aid workers reach those in need, they will have a task of the highest magnitude.</P>
    <P>This House last examined the position in Rwanda on 5 May.  What we have learnt since and what we see and learn everyday, makes it all the more compelling for this small country to commit itself to use every means available to end the nightmare of death in Rwanda.  The Government will continue to use every avenue open to it to bring an end to the conflict and to alleviate the suffering of the Rwandese people.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view that actions speak louder than words.  I have decided to travel to the region too view the position first hand.  I intend to make known the deep concern of the Government at the appalling loss of life, my support for the peace efforts of the Tanzanian and neighbouring Governments and the Irish aid effort.  I do not promise any miracles but if I can demonstrate by my presence <Col N="233" /> the intense concern and the anguish of the Irish people at the carnage that is happening before our eyes, then I feel such a visit will be worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Since March this year the value of the Irish pound has risen from 95p sterling to more than 98p and it reached 99p yesterday.  The 4 per cent increase in its value is having a serious effect on our exports to the UK and Northern Ireland.  It adversely affects the competitiveness of our exporters against UK suppliers in Third World markets, Europe, America and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Irish Dairy Board stated the Irish pound had risen to an unrealistic level which caused it to switch a product from the commercial market to intervention sales.  While 30 per cent of our total exports go to the UK and Northern Ireland, 50 per cent of the exports of the labour-intensive, manufacturing sector go to other markets.  A loss of market share on those markets will have an immediate impact on Irish jobs.  A survey carried out among exporters in the past few days shows that the punt at a value of 99p will result in an average drop in sales of 7.68 per cent while employment in those companies could decrease by 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of our currency is a major element in our international competitiveness but the negative effect is compounded by the very serious tax/PRSI wedge.  Companies maintaining operations in Ireland and the UK report that the Irish operation is becoming uncompetitive mainly because of our tax and PRSI rates.  One recent example was Pretty Polly in Killarney, a company that faced up to a great number of problems. It is one of the major companies in the south Kerry area but the problem is that in Killarney the social cost is £20 more per employee than in England, which <Col N="234" /> posed a major dilemma for the company. Unless we come to terms with our penal tax on jobs here there will be other examples of the type of problem facing Pretty Polly.</P>
    <P>The Government must find some mechanism to reduce the Irish pound from its present unrealistic level.  This could involve a reduction of interest rates or intervention by the Central Bank in the market by selling Irish pounds, which it did yesterday or the day before.  In the long run, however, we must question the Government's decision which seems to be to stay aligned to the Deutsche Mark rather than the pound sterling which accounts for a larger percentage of our exports and a much larger percentage of expert related jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government should also consider increasing the funds available for trade promotion to allow exporters to visit their markets.  There was a decrease of £3 million, or 8 per cent, in the Estimates for the marketing and administration funds of An Bord Tráchtála which will result in fewer grants being available for private individuals trying to market their products in the UK and other destinations, resulting in further problems for Irish exports.  Even though we are performing well ahead of the world average at the moment, we cannot take these markets for granted.  There is competition for markets and unless we sustain our efforts we can lost them quite easily.</P>
    <P>It will become obvious in time that a commot market which does not have a common currency is a nonsense.  Where would the US be with 52 separate currencies? Pressure will come from the new entrants to the European Union for a common currency, and the Government should be using all its persuasive powers to move Europe in this direction. Although there are vested interests against such a move in the long run it represents the best option for an international trading economy like ours.  Will the Minister spell out the Government's contingency plans to prevent a recurrence <Col N="235" /> of what happened at the end of 1992?  It should have a policy to ensure that Irish exporters are protected and that jobs, especially indigenous jobs, are not threatened.  Currency fluctuations are affecting indigenous industry more than other sectors.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this issue.  I am not aware that the level of the Irish pound is causing serious difficulties for Irish exporters generally, although I have noted concerns expressed in recent days on behalf of exporters to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The value of sterling has been fluctuating on the foreign currency markets. While the Irish pound has appreciated against sterling recently, it is still well below the level against sterling at which it was trading after the January 1993 devaluation.  Against other currencies its value is less than it was before the January 1993 devaluation and overall, on a trade-weighted basis, it is still somewhat below the level which obtained before the 1992 ERM crisis.  Of course, price stability continues to be the objective of exchange rate policy and policy is not designed to target any currency or basket of currencies.</P>
      <P>In any event the ability of industry to compete abroad does not depend solely on exchange rate levels.  A key requirement is that it operates in a macroeconomic framework characterised by low inflation, low interest rates and pay moderation.  This is the environment Governments have been providing over recent years: our economy is growing, inflation is low and Government finances are on target.  Such an environment is of course dependent on the maintenance of an exchange rate policy directed at price stability, as Ireland's is.  The Government is committed to maintaining this environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> In this context a key feature of the business environment is the level of interest rates.  Deputies should realise that recent months, when the Irish pound has been appreciating, have been a period of falling interest rates: they are now at their lowest level since the 1970s, a factor of significant benefit to businesses generally, including exporters to the UK.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, for course, appreciate that we do not and cannot control the value of sterling.  We cannot, therefore, guarantee that the Irish pound will always be at, or below, any given level against sterling.  In these circumstances, it is primarily up to exporters to ensure that their products are competitive on overseas markets.  This is a matter essentially of control of costs.</P>
    <P>As the House will also be aware, the financial markets provide exporters and importers with financial instruments to help to reduce the risks associated with exchange rate movements.  In particular, it is possible to buy and sell foreign exchange forward where a business considers that being exposed to foreign exchange movements is too much of a risk.  I, therefore, urge foreign traders and their bankers to review their approach to exchange rate exposure to ensure that they are taking advantage of the market opportunities available to minimise exchange rate risk.</P>
    <P>The Government has been active to improve the ability of Irish industry to compete internationally and, for example, the National Development Plan for the use of EU Structural Funds should be of significant help in this regard.  Many of the measures in the 1994 budget should also help exporters.  These measures include: the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy; the reduction in employers' PRSI contributions in respect of low-paid employees; the abolition of the health and employment and training levies in respect of low-paid employees the abolition of the obligation on employers to pay such levies in respect of low-paid employees who hold medical <Col N="237" /> cards and the introduction of an interest rate subsidy scheme to help certain small and medium-size enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Government intends in future budgets to take measures to further improve the international competitiveness of Irish industry as budgetary circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming here to reply.  This group water scheme at Cappataggle near Ballinasloe involves 67 householders.  I understand approximately 70 connections will be made if and when the Minister and the Department sanction the scheme.  The water supply source for this scheme was tested almost five years ago, in 1989, and was passed as suitable.  After that chemical and bacteriological tests were carried out and also passed.  There were some difficulties about the amount of money for road restoration. These have also been surmounted and the sum has now been reduced to £165,000.  Now that these problems have been dealt with, I hope the Department can give the go-ahead.  A contractor was appointed for this scheme over two years ago.  I hope the Minister will now see his way not only to sanctioning this scheme but to increasing the level of grant aid for group water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had grants at the rate of £700 for householders and £500 for farmers for the past nine years.  The group water scheme cannot be completed without a special contribution.  In all such schemes special contributions are made.  It would make much more sense if grants were doubled and I propose that the Minister do so in order that schemes proceed more quickly.  Many group water schemes in County Galway are ready to proceed but <Col N="238" /> the grants package available is not sufficient to deal with them.</P>

      <P>There is a greater number of schemes in County Galway than in Mayo.  We were fortunate in that one scheme was announced last week in the Ballinasloe area and I am pressing for other schemes to be undertaken in that area.  This scheme is very good value for money.  The Minister should recognise the voluntary effort of those providing a service for people who would normally receive a water supply from the local authority.  The Minister should approve the grants and give sanction to start work on the Cappataggle group water scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Kitt for raising the issue of the Cappataggle group water scheme.  This proposed scheme is intended to serve up to 65 houses and 60 farms.  The group also intends using a local ground water source to supply the scheme.  Deputy Kitt will appreciate that Cappataggle is not a typical or straightforward group water scheme.  The estimated cost of completing this scheme is well over £500,000, a unit cost of around £8,000 per house served.  Group water scheme grants are estimated at around £75,500 or 14 per cent of overall cost.</P>
      <P>The area to be served is lacking in natural sources of water supply and far removed from the nearest public water supply at Ballinasloe.  Two possible sources were identified, a local spring and the proposed Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme.  The current proposal is based on developing the local ground water source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the group intends supplying up to 65 houses only, the design capacity of the intake and associated headworks, as well as the distribution system is considerably in excess of immediate group scheme needs.  This arose out of Galway County Council's recommendation that <Col N="239" /> the design for the scheme should be expanded in order to integrate with the council's long term water supply plans for the region.  As a result, the cost of the group scheme has increased enormously and the scheme is no longer financially viable as a standard group scheme, financed by way of group water scheme grants and members' own contributions.</P>
    <P>The Cappataggle project is a very large and complex one, requiring large diameter watermains and sophisticated abstraction and treatment facilities. Because of the cost involved, the scheme is extremely difficult to accommodate under my Department's group schemes programme since grants plus members' own contributions amount to less than 30 per cent of overall cost.  In order for the project to be developed as a private group scheme, it would require a supplementary grant of up to £400,000 out of the provision for public water and sewerage schemes.  Having regard to the existing high level of commitments for public schemes as well as high priority group schemes, it has not been possible to approve the Cappataggle scheme so far.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt will be aware that in this House on 8 March last I indicated to him that arrangements for water and sanitary services schemes generally, including group water schemes, are being reviewed in the context of the operational programme for environmental services, now at an advanced stage of negotiation.  I assure Deputy Kitt that we intend to look again at the Cappataggle position in the light of the outcome of the current negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State present, but this is the third time in recent months this matter has been raised &mdash; it was raised <Col N="240" /> in the Seanad by Senator Burke on 3 February and this is the second time I have raised it on the Adjournment &mdash; and I am extremely disappointed that on each occasion the Minister for Health was not present, nor was the Minister of State at that Department.  I regard this as contemptuous treatment of a legitimate and valid claim which was first made 20 years ago.  It is simply not good enough that time after time when a mater is raised in this House the Minister responsible fobs it off to a decent Minister of State who does not know the intricacies or the details involved in what is a complex matter.  I speak for the people of Mayo, for the nurses and doctors of the hospital, the patients and all involved with Mayo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The 1994 Estimates include a provision of £45 million for capital services for hospital buildings and the provision of medical facilities in hospitals.  In respect of the commencement of phase 2 of the work at Mayo General Hospital only a paltry sum is required.  There is a conspiracy of complacency between sections of the health board and the Department of Health in this matter.  It is obvious that there are some people who do not want phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital completed. I am astounded at the length of time it has taken to establish an agreement between the Department of Health and the Western Health Board that this is the board's priority for capital development &mdash; I note in the Minister's reply to a question from me last week that he agrees this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the official the Minister was supposed to have sent to Mayo General Hospital not appear to discuss this matter?  Why has no meeting taken place between officials of the health board and the Department of Health on determining the difference in estimated funding for completion of phase 2 &mdash; £15 million is the Department of Health estimate and £7 million is the Western Health Board estimate?  I challenge the Minister to examine the report submitted <Col N="241" /> by the quantity surveyor, which is with the health board, and shows an estimated cost of £7 million for completion of phase 2.  Why did the meeting not take place as promised?</P>
    <P>This matter has become a political football at the expense of the people of Mayo.  When Commissioner Flynn was in office he promised that this work would go ahead, but he failed to deliver.  Deputy O'Rourke, when Minister for Health, promised this facility, as did Deputy O'Hanlon when Minister, but both Ministers failed to deliver.  Ten years after I was elected to this House Barry Desmond, then Minister for Health, sanctioned work on phase 1 of this project.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, a hardworking Minister, made an announcement on this matter on 3 February, but it is not good enough merely to announce the go ahead for planning and design. There is a further six months' work involved in the planning and design stage and very little money will be required in 1994.  I expect the Minister, when he visits Mayo on 30 May, to not alone announce the go ahead for planning and design but to state that we will allow the matter to proceed to tender thereafter.  He should guarantee that money will be made available in the 1995 Estimates to ensure that work begins on phase 2 of this project.</P>
    <P>A geriatric assessment unit is urgently required at Mayo General Hospital, in view of the fact that this part of Ireland has the highest number of people over 65 years.  The casualty department has only three cubicles and is completely inadequate to deal with over 16,500 attendances per year.  A distance of over 400 yards must be travelled to bring x-rays to and from casualty departments.  What was designed as the centre of the building is now at the end; it is half a hospital and represents contemptuous treatment of people who must travel very long distances between Sligo Regional Hospital and University College Hospital in Galway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> There is a conspiracy of complacency in the Department of Health in regard to this matter.  Somebody does not want the phase 2 development to be completed and I challenge the Minister, on behalf of all the people of County Mayo, to state categorically that he will allow this phase to go ahead because the road is now clear for him to do so.</P>
    <P>I warn Fianna Fáil and Labour that this matter will not be treated lightly in the next two weeks.  These weeks are critical for the provision of facilities for all our people for the next 50 years.  It is insulting that one should have to raise this matter continually in the House without having the Minister present.  It is simply not good enough that the people of County Mayo should be left deprived of medical facilities that are so urgently required.  The Government, with a majority of 36, can take this action at any time but it so happens that a by-election is due to take place on 9 June and I hope the matter is dealt with before then.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to communicate to the Minister for Health the serious concerns of everybody in our county in regard to this matter.  We know action cannot take place overnight; it must happen on a phased basis.  I passionately urge the Minister of State to communicate this request to the Minister immediately so that he can deal with it on 30 May when he visits our county.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Kenny for giving me this opportunity of commenting on the phase 2 development of Mayo General Hospital. As the Deputy is aware, the need for a second phase development at this hospital is fully accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board has recently submitted proposals for a reduced phase 2 scheme to the Department. The board's proposals are only sketched in broad outline at this stage and it will be necessary for the Department to go into more detail, in consultation with <Col N="243" /> officials of the board, in order to establish the feasibility of the proposals from the planning and service points of view. Pending the completion of this assessment, I am not in a position to give an accurate estimate of the costs involved in the revised proposal, but I can assure the Deputy that as soon as the examination has been completed, full consideration will be given to progressing this matter <Col N="244" /> in the context of all the other competing demands for capital funding that are currently in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health will be visiting Mayo General Hospital on Monday next and will be availing of the opportunity to examine the existing facilities at first hand and meet with all interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 May 1994.</P>

      <P>The main elements of the Government's approach to the terrible conflict in Rwanda were set out in my speech to the Dáil on 5 May.  Subsequently I asked that the matter be placed on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council on 16-17 May.  The conflict was considered in depth by Foreign Ministers of the European Union and the main lines of the Union's response are <Col N="71" /> set out in a Declaration issued after the meeting.  The Declaration incorporates the key points of Ireland's policy: support for a review by the UN Security Council of UNAMIR's size and mandate.  This has now been carried out.  On 17 May the Security Council in Resolution 918 agreed to an increase in the size of UNAMIR and expanded its mandate. The UN Secretary-General has sent his Chief Military Adviser to Rwanda to consult the parties on all aspects of UNAMIR's expanded mandate; support for the mission to Rwanda and Burundi by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The High Commissioner has visited Rwanda and I am arranging that a copy of his report be placed in the Dáil Library for the information of Deputies; support for an emergency meeting in Geneva of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  This will now take place on 24-25 May.  Although Ireland is not a member of the Commission we will attend as an observer and the Irish delegation is playing an active part in the European Union's preparations for the meeting; support for a UN Security Council arms embargo.  This has now been imposed by the Security Council in Resolution 918; Foreign Ministers endorsed Ireland's proposal for an early visit by the Troika of Development Ministers to countries neighbouring Rwanda to evaluate the humanitarian situation and the Declaration also commits the European Union to increasing its humanitarian aid to the stricken population within Rwanda and to refugees in neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>I believe that the agreement in the Foreign Affairs Council gives significant international backing to Ireland's policy. We will continue to work in every way possible for a resolution of the conflict and for the alleviation of the suffering of the Rwandese people.</P>

      <P>At its meeting on 11 May the Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the possibility of funding being made available from the Irish Aid Programme for the upgrading of the airstrip at Nagara in Tanzania so as to assist with the delivery of humanitarian relief to the Rwandan refugees in the area.  In a resolution adopted at that meeting, the Committee urged that Irish Aid should take a lead role on this.</P>
      <P>Two officers of the Irish Aid Programme in Tanzania, one of them an engineer, were immediately sent to Nagara.  They held meetings with the UN High Commission for Refugees, which is the UN agency responsible for co-ordinating the relief effort in the area, with Concern, GOAL and other aid agencies. On the basis of these discussions, it was concluded that the upgrading of the airstrip at Nagara is not an immediate priority.  The European Union is carrying out improvements to the airstrip and to the access roads but neither the UNHCR nor the other agencies envisage the further upgrading of the airstrip to take heavy cargo aircraft.  Emphasis is instead being placed on meeting the needs of the camps at Nagara by road and rail.  There is an urgent need to improve the water and sanitation facilities of new camps which are being set up and such heavy equipment as is available is being employed on this work.</P>
      <P>The Government have made it clear to the Irish organisations which are assisting the victims of the Rwandan civil war that we are prepared to provide further financial support for suitable projects in addition to the £547,000 already provided. We are discussing with these agencies what the most pressing priorities are and have informed them that we will respond sympathetically to their proposals.</P>

      <P>At the World Health Assembly on 12 May 1993, a resolution was adopted by 73 votes in favour, with 31 against and six abstentions, requesting the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on whether or not, in view of the health and environmental effects, the use of nuclear weapons by a state in war or other armed conflict would be a breach of its obligations under international law, including the WHO Constitution.  The International Court of Justice has invited statements on this issue by 10 June 1994 from interested States.</P>
      <P>Ireland's opposition to nuclear weapons is of long standing and well known.  Successive Governments have made clear our policy of seeking the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  We have consistently and actively supported the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we are currently working to achieve an indefinite extension of the Treaty at the Review Conference which will take place next year.</P>

    <P>It is clear that the World Court Project, in its campaign to secure an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, has secured widespread public support in a number of countries, reflecting concerns about the health and environmental <Col N="74" /> effects of a nuclear war.

      <P>The existence of a significant leak in the tunnel in question which passes under the Grand Canal first came to the attention of the Commissioners of Public Works two weeks ago.  Work to repair the leak, which was allowing water to escape from the canal, was commenced immediately.  Passage of boats through this section of the canal is not possible until the repair works are completed.  It is therefore essential to complete the work as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The siphon referred to was placed in the tunnel by a local landowner apparently without authorisation about 12 years ago.  The Commissioners of Public Works have no objection to the removal of the siphon which serves no purpose in relation to the canal.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are not prepared to carry out the suggested lowering of a pipe as part of the repair work now under way as this would be very costly, would prolong the closure of the canal to an unacceptable extent and would be of no benefit to the canal.  It is not at all clear that the suggested works would solve any drainage problems that exist in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that if anyone wishes to pursue the possibility of installing or lowering a pipe under the canal at their <Col N="75" /> own expense, they should take the matter up directly with the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

The <Col N="76" /> authorities responsible for implementation of operational programmes under the Community Support Framework are listed in Appendix 3 of the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999,</i> a copy of which is included in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The main implementing bodies are represented on the Operational Committees of the Regional Authorities, which are being established to advise and assist the authorities on matters concerning their functions in relation to EU assistance.  It is envisaged that the operational committees will usually meet not more than four times a year to receive and consider progress reports and financial statements on current and planned implementation measures.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce a tax relief to offset the cost of childcare.  The introduction of such a general tax concession would clearly be very expensive in terms of revenue foregone by the Exchequer and would have to be made up elsewhere. In addition, were such a measure to be introduced, it would undoubtedly generate cognate claims from other taxpayers for tax reliefs in relation to other personal expenses arising out of their particular circumstances.  Such claims would then, in equity, be hard to resist.</P>

      <Quest>if a house which has been left to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 by his late mother in a valid will can be transferred to this person without cost in view of the fact that this person's only income is unemployment assistance of £59.20; and if he will waive stamp duties in this case.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when property which has been left by will to a person is transferred into that person's name a number of charges may arise including capital acquisitions tax, CAT, probate tax, <Col N="79" /> stamp duty, probate fees and Land Registry fees.  Probate fees and Land Registry fees fall within the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>In so far as transfers from parent to child are concerned, CAT is normally only payable on amounts in excess of the Class I exemption threshold, currently £174,000.  As regards stamp duty, a nominal £10 charge will apply with no provision for waiver.</P>
      <P>Probate tax is charged at 2 per cent on the taxable value of the estate where this exceeds £10,150.  However, the family home is exempt from probate tax where it passes to a dependent child or relative of the deceased where the dependant's total annual income does not exceed a specified amount, currently £4,023.  To qualify as a dependent child, one must be under 18 years of age at the date of death or, if not, be receiving full-time education.  A dependent relative is a relative of the deceased who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity.  I should add that the relevant legislation in relation to CAT and probate tax enables the Revenue Commissioners to allow a postponement of the tax, including waiver of interest, in cases of hardship.  While details of the particular case to which the Deputy refers have not yet been received by the Revenue Commissioners, on a general level such cases are viewed on their individual merits by the Revenue Commissioners in the light of all the circumstances of the beneficiary.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this year's Finance <Col N="81" /> Bill provides for a very generous stamp duty relief for transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young farmers who meet certain training requirements.  The transferee must have acquired a Teagasc certificate in farming or an equivalent educational qualification; or, if born before 1 January 1968, have three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc farm management training courses of not less than 180 hours duration.</P>
      <P>The training conditions are important to ensure that the relief is focused on transfers to suitably skilled farmers with a commitment to the practice of farming. Accordingly, there are no provisions whereby a person who has not completed the full 180 hours training on the date of execution of the deed may benefit from the stamp duty relief.</P>

      <P>Covenants by a parent or grandparent to a child or grandchild are effective for tax purposes only if the amount covenanted does not exceed 5 per cent of the covenantors total income.  The legislation does not set out an upper limit on the level of total income to which the 5 per cent applies but there is an inbuilt control in the system.  If the amount covenanted together with any other income the child or grandchild has brings his or her effective tax rate to the same level as the effective tax rate of the parent or grandparent, then there will be no tax advantage arising from the covenant.</P>

In 1994 I will be increasing the higher rate further to £25 representing a total increase for the higher rate of over 9 per cent since early 1993.

      <P>I can confirm that I have received representations requesting the provision of a full time Garda station in Leixlip, County Kildare.  I would also refer the Deputy to my response to Parliamentary Questions No.  70 of 10 February 1994 and No. 189 of 6 October 1993 in the matter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware a Garda substation was officially opened in Leixlip in 1991 and is open to the public from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. and from 7.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. from Monday to Friday and from 12 noon to 2 p.m. on Saturday.  There are no plans to change these arrangements, which ensure that the maximum number of gardaí are available for outdoor policing duties in Leixlip rather than being confined to administrative tasks at the sub-station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Leixlip forms part of the Ballyfermot District and receives a 24 hour police service by the gardaí attached to Lucan Garda station.  The Garda authorities have assigned a sergeant and two extra gardaí to the sole purpose of policing the Leixlip area with effect from 7 March 1994.  This brings the overall number of gardaí allocated exclusively to community policing duties in Leixlip, to one sergeant and six gardaí.  These members work on shifts between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 a.m.  A Garda vanette is allocated to the area on a full time basis.  The area is also policed by mobile patrols <Col N="90" /> from within the District during the hours of most need, particularly late at night or early in the morning and at weekends.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present arrangements are adequate to meet the policing needs of the Leixlip area.  However the question of providing additional staff and resources will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 132 together.  The provision of speech therapy services in County Mayo is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  Speech therapy services for children with a mental handicap in County Mayo attending special classes in mainstream schools are provided by the Western Care Association on behalf of the Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of problems generally concerning speech therapy services which is primarily due to a lack of sufficient numbers of trained staff.  My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College, Dublin, commencing in the 1992-1993 academic year. The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 <Col N="124" /> students in 1995-1996.  The development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy.</P>

Between 1990 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families. The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care and respite services has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, funding is being made available to develop specialist services for those with dementia in South-East Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  It is hoped <Col N="125" /> that these services will be in operation before the end of the year or early next year.  My Department is also considering a request for funding from the Alzheimer Society towards the development of the valuable services for the society.</P>
    <P>I am having the case raised by the Deputy investigated and I will write separately to the Deputy with the findings.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board has been developing its mental health services in line with the recommendations of the report on the psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future</i> which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive Governments.  This report advocated the <Col N="126" /> development of a comprehensive, sectorised, community-based mental health service as an alternative to institutional care which isolates patients from their communities.  The report proposed that acute admission units, attached to general hospitals should be established to operate in association with a range of community-based services.  In the Western Health Board functional area, acute units are located in University College Hospital, Galway; St. Theresa's Unit, Castlebar, County Mayo and in Roscommon General Hospital.  Community-based facilities such as community residences, day hospitals, out-patient clinics, day centres and training workshops have been provided in each catchment area.</P>
      <P>There are three long-stay psychiatric institutions located at St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe, County Galway accommodating 450 patients, St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar, County Mayo accommodating 243 patients and St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, County Roscommon with 75 patients.  St. Patrick's, Castlerea will shortly be transferred to the Department of Justice for the development of a prison and the Government is committed to the provision of alternative accommodation for patients resident therein.</P>
      <P>The remaining information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following table.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board plans to continue its development of community-based services thereby reducing its traditional reliance on long-stay hospital care.  This will be completed with a phased transfer of resources to community care services and few will doubt the improvement in the quality of life of the mentally ill following their transfer from an institutional to a community-based setting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Health Strategy, which I launched recently identified a number of organisational weaknesses affecting general practice in Ireland which are of particular relevance to general practice in rural areas.  General practitioners, particularly rural practitioners, often work in isolation from their practising colleagues. Such isolation is also evident in the need to improve rural general practitioners' interface with other primary care services and hospital services.  Because of the manner in which general practitioner services are organised, with the preponderence of single handed practices, there are inefficiencies in the use of resources, duplication of costs and increased workload for general practitioners.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the strategy in so far as general practice is concerned is to ensure that the service will be better organised and supported in fulfilling a wider and more integrated role in the health care system.  In achieving this aim, incentives for the improved organisation of general practice will be designed so that patients have easier access to a wider range of services provided by their general practitioner.  Assistance will be targeted on group practices, amalgamated practices and in particular on co-operative type arrangements which are in many instances more applicable in a rural setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health board general practice units are currently developing proposals with individual general practitioners which will address organisational problems particularly those relating to rural practitioners. Units are also developing arrangements with practitioners to provide additional services where these can <Col N="129" /> be carried out more cost-effectively than at present.  This is particularly relevant in relation to the transfer of services from hospitals into the community referred to by the Deputy.  Such services may include paramedical services, diagnostic services traditionally performed within hospitals, counselling and nursing services.</P>
    <P>The strategy is specific in ensuring that treatment and care are provided in the most appropriate setting.  In addition, there are opportunities for the improved interface between the general practitioners and the hospital service by the involvement of hospital outreach clinics within general practice, the development of combined care protocols and pre-hospital referral protocols involving general practitioners and consultants.</P>
    <P>There are important opportunities for the development of general practice in rural areas on the lines I have outlined. The successful implementation of the strategy requires that general practice has the capacity through appropriate organisational arrangements and the resources to respond effectively to such developments. I am satisfied that resources will continue to be made available to implement these important elements of the National Health Strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem of this type.  In December 1993, following further discussions, I allocated an additional £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the accident and emergency hospitals to be eased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six <Col N="131" /> major A &amp; E hospitals in Dublin, who were no longer in need of acute hospital care, in step-down accommodation more appropriate to their condition.</P>
    <P>The changes which I have recently announced in relation to the charge for attendance at accident and emergency departments is intended to create an incentive for patients to attend their general practitioner in the first instance, in cases where their condition would be most appropriately treated at this level. I am hopeful that this change will help to ease the pressure on hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Mater Hospital that the person in question was admitted to the accident and emergency department on 16 May 1994.  Whilst in the accident and emergency department, he was under the constant supervision of the medical and nursing staff of that department.  I understand that he is currently a patient in the hospital and is undergoing tests and examinations in relation to his illness.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <P>My proposals for changes in the organisational structures of the health services are set out in the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo; chapter of the Health Strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board will be <Col N="132" /> replaced by a new authority which will be responsible for all health and personal social services in the region.  With regard to the other health boards, which are to be renamed &ldquo;health authorities&rdquo;, there will be a clearer distinction made between the roles and responsibilities of the boards and their executives.  Also, in delivering their services the health authorities will be expected to focus more closely on health and social gain, key concepts in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The new health authorities will be composed of board and executive.  I have not yet made my decisions about the composition of the boards.  I will take account of any views expressed during the consultation which will now take place in relation to implementing the health strategy. The detailed management arrangements will be worked out later.</P>
    <P>The health authorities will continue to be Exchequer funded but new financial controls are being introduced to reinforce budgetary observance.  Also, the direct funding of voluntary agencies by my Department will cease and this responsibility will be taken over by the health authorities.  It should be noted that the independent identity of the voluntary agencies will be fully respected under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The organisational changes set out in health strategy are necessary to achieving the reshaping of the health services in terms of a clear strategic direction so that improving peoples' health and quality of life become the focus of the health authorities' activities.  The legislation to implement these changes will now be prepared for submission to Government.</P>

    <P>The essential feature of the third level student support schemes is to facilitate access to students into third level who because of low personal/parental income would not normally be able to support their attendance at third level.</P>
    <P>Many improvements have been made to the schemes in recent years including the introduction of special provisions for mature students and the increase in income limits by 40 per cent in 1992.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the schemes and application forms were reviewed and made more user friendly, income and fee limits were further increased and provision for the renewal of grants for repeat years, in case of certified serious illness were introduced.</P>
    <P>The 1994 schemes contained changes which will continue to improve access for students entering full-time third level education.</P>
    <P>The main changes are:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Academic Attainment Conditions &mdash;</i> The two honour requirement is effectively superceded and a student who secures a place in an approved third level course will be deemed to satisfy the academic attainments conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Second Chance Students &mdash; Higher Education Grants Scheme and vocational education committee Scholarships Scheme &mdash;</i> Second chance students have been added as a new category of person to whom the scheme applies.  Such students who have had a break in studies of five years and return to repeat at the same level in 1994/95 may receive grants aid.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increased Income Eligibility Criteria/Maintenance Grants/Fee Grants</i>&mdash; Income eligibility limits have been increased by 5.4 per cent and maintenance grants by 1.7 per cent.  These increases are in line with movements in <Col N="135" /> the average industrial wage and the consumer price index respectively.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post Graduate Students</i>&mdash; Mature students commencing a postgraduate course without already holding a primary degree may now qualify for grant-aid.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Application Form</i>&mdash; The layout of the application form has been further simplified to make it more user-friendly.</P>

      <P>Courses in the Agricultural College in Enniskillen are not currently approved for the purposes of my Department's third level student support schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Higher Education Grants Acts 1968-1978 grant aid is only payable <Col N="136" /> to students attending approved courses in approved institutions.  As the Agricultural College in Enniskillen is not an approved institution grant-aid under the third level student support schemes is not payable.</P>
    <P>Grant-aid for such courses in Northern Ireland is only covered by the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and is regarded as outside the remit of the Northern Ireland Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to include this college under my Department's third level student support schemes.</P>

      <P>The Youthreach programme is provided in the education sector by the vocational education committees in a network of out-of-school centres.  The programme provides integrated education, vocational training and work experience for young people in the 15-18 year age group who have left school early with no qualifications or vocational training.  The overall provision for the scheme in the education sector this year is £7.752 million. The grants to operating authorities are based on an overall average unit cost of per trainee, and cover tuition, overheads, equipment and materials and other running costs.  The figures exclude training allowances which are paid by FAS.</P>
      <P>The programme is designed to provide a flexible response to the needs of early school leavers, and programme content is tailored to motivate trainees to acquire a range of competences essential for further training or employment.  In the context of exchanges and visits abroad my Department understands that a number of Youthreach centres avail of schemes such as &ldquo;Youth for Europe&rdquo; and the PETRA programme to enable trainees to spend short periods overseas.</P>

Primary schools can be selected at random for such audits or where it is perceived that difficulties exist in the maintenance of the school account.  My Department has on occasions conducted such audits.</P>
      <P>However, in the discussion paper which I recently produced on regional education councils, I acknowledged that the current position regarding auditing the expenditure of Exchequer funds by individual schools was unsatisfactory, and that I envisaged that each council when established would be required to audit such expenditure under an annual audit programme.  This annual audit programme would be subject to approval by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts of a number of community and comprehensive schools are <Col N="145" /> audited by my Department's officials on an annual basis.  The financial control mechanisms for secondary schools, which are private institutions and which are grant aided by my Department, do not include audit by my Department.  The accounts of vocational education committees are audited by the local government auditors.  In this audit the accounts of schools may also be audited.  From 1 January 1994 the accounts of the vocational education committees will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>The teacher allocation for a secondary school for a particular school year is made up of a number of elements as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  An allocation on the basis of the current pupil teacher ratio in respect of the enrolment at the end of the preceding September and</P>
      <P>2.  Ex-Quota and concessionary posts.</P>
      <P>The teacher allocation for this school for the 1994-95 school year has been determined on this basis.  It shows an increase of three posts over the allocation for the current school year.  Two of these posts arise as a result of increased enrolments and the third post arises as a result of the vice-principal post being regarded as ex-quota in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to the school authorities to apply for an increase in the allocation on the basis of a projected increase in enrolments.  Should such an application <Col N="151" /> be received, it will be considered in the normal way.</P>
    <P>This school is one of the schools which have applied for an additional post under the terms of the scheme for the allocation of additional posts to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas.  The school authorities will be advised in due course whether their application has been successful.</P>
    <P>Schools receive an allocation of teaching resources and grants towards recurrent costs in respect of transition year students.  The rate of capitation grant for secondary schools was increased by £8 per student from January 1994 and by £23 per student in the case of disadvantaged schools.  The question of providing further resources for the transition year is under consideration in the Department at present.</P>
    <P>No application has been received from the school in question regarding grant-aid for the provision of a link to the adjacent primary school building.  If and when one is received it will be given detailed consideration.</P>
