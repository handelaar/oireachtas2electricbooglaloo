      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Progress on the implementation of the Government programme is kept constantly under review. Deputies will be aware that for every full year that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have been in Government, we have published an annual progress report. The third annual progress report of this current Administration was published on 25 July 2005.</P>
        <P>The total cost of printing and publication was &euro;665.50 which relates to the cover design services and &euro;14,484 for translation into the Irish language. The document was printed in-house in the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The progress reports set out the progress to date in implementing every single commitment in the programme for Government. It is the responsibility of each Minister to ensure that the commitments in the programme that fall within his or her portfolio are fully implemented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of the Taoiseach derives its mandate from my role as head of Government. As such, it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government. It provides support to me as Taoiseach and to the Government through the Government secretariat, the Cabinet committee system and through its involvement in key policy areas and initiatives.</P>
        <P>The current key strategic priorities of the Department are set out in its strategy statement. They include Northern Ireland, EU and international affairs, economic and social policy, social partnership, public service modernisation and the information society and e-Government.</P>
        <P>I and the Ministers of State in my Department answer questions in the House on these issues. In all of its work, my Department works closely with other Departments and offices. Individual Ministers are answerable to the House in respect of their own specific areas of responsibility.</P>
        <P>The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of An Agreed Programme for Government can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of social partnership, working with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, co-ordinating the e-Government initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of on-line Government services and ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of my role as a member of the European Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach well satisfied with the performance of his Government as measured against the programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="799"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For example, does that relate to the commitment to have 80% of taxpayers paying income tax at the standard rate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost 90% of our record tax reductions went to someone other than a person who pays the top rate of tax. Therefore, we have targeted all our measures at those on lower incomes to try to improve their position. The tax rate is no longer at the extraordinary high rates of the past. It has reduced from 48% to 42%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the commitment was for 80% and almost 50% are paying at the marginal or top rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said in the past, questions of a specific nature might be addressed directly to the Minister responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be another two budgets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not able to handle specific questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;5 billion has been given back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier this year the Taoiseach told the House:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department of the Taoiseach derives its mandate from my role as Head of Government. As such, it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If the Taoiseach is prepared to say he is happy with the performance of his Government, how can he stand over a situation in which one in five children leave primary school with difficulties in reading and writing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have quoted the Taoiseach&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has always accepted questions in a general way. Specific questions should be addressed to the line Minister. This has been the ruling of successive incumbents in this Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is prepared to state specifically that his Government is doing a good job. He says so on behalf of all his Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach answers general questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the life of this Government and the previous one, thankfully the vast bulk of <Col N="800"/>resources have gone into education and particularly into education for the disadvantaged. An enormous number of additional teachers, some 4,500, including 3,000 resource teachers, have been employed in our primary schools. Particularly in this Government we have targeted our measures towards education for the disadvantaged to try to help eliminate areas of disadvantage. In international criteria we hold up extremely well in most aspects of education and in our primary education in particular. There are some areas where we would like to see some improvement and that is what the whole education system is about. This is why we spend the kinds of resources we do. However, we have continually targeted this area. Allocating more money means additional teachers as that is where the whole expenditure is in education. They have been appointed to deal with disadvantage and improve the service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Taoiseach defend his Government by saying it is doing very well? For instance, the Government was found out having a liability of &euro;2 billion for illegal charges in nursing homes. The Supreme Court struck down legislation the Government introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last occasion when the Deputy had a list of issues he wanted to raise the Chair pointed out the questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment that the Government is doing well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;should be put to the Minister responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How can the Taoiseach stand over and defend a Minister who he says is doing well, who introduced a system for the personnel, payroll and related systems in the Department of Health and Children, which has run amok and is completely out of control?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled on these questions in the past and successive incumbents have ruled on these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quoting the Taoiseach&rsquo;s words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions relating to individual Departments should be addressed to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>You are not Taoiseach yet, a Cheann Comhairle. The Taoiseach said in the House: &ldquo;As such, it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that if I were to apply what the <Col N="801"/>Deputy wants, everybody in the House would be entitled to answer questions for the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why he is the Taoiseach, the Head of Government. It is why he is prepared to say in the House that he is involved in virtually all aspects of all the work of Government. He is quite prepared to say that the Ministers in his Government are doing well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why Deputy Kenny is not Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have questions for the Minister for Education and Science after this. If we were to employ Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s principle, there would be no need for us to have them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle must have been up very early this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny knows the Supreme Court decision on the nursing homes issue went back over many decades and successive Governments. It is a decision we must respect and legislation is being prepared to deal with the situation.</P>
        <P>People have different views on the computer issue. It would obviously have been better if a review of the contract had taken place every six months or year. However, an organisation with 146,000 whole-time equivalent employees needs a modern computer system. Whatever analysis is done and whatever the Health Service Executive finally decides, it needs a proper technology system that will allow it to have up-to-date information. I accept it should have had tighter controls as it proceeded with the system, but it did not. Both Deputy Kenny and I probably found out at the same time during the summer from the staff involved how the HSE system was operating. Let us hope we learn a lesson from it for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We noticed the Taoiseach came from Finglas to Blanchardstown yesterday for a number of official openings. Did he have the pleasure of spending a long time in the biggest car park in the country, the M50? He did not do any official opening of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It only took me ten minutes to get back into town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, ten minutes on the inside lane in his public service vehicle. The Taoiseach should have gone out to see the M50 car park this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone around Blanchardstown is working now. They are not stuck there at that time of the day. It is not like it used to be. They are all at work.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="802"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They are stuck out in that car park from 6.30 a.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>At least the M50 is in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Deputy Higgins a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Does the Taoiseach see that a conflict has arisen in a number of areas between his programme for Government and the regulators and quangos his Government has tended to set up to avoid direct responsibility? They are at a remove from Cabinet Ministers and the Government. I will make a brief reference to what I mean to illustrate this. The programme for Government promised 3,000 extra beds in the public hospital system, but the chief of the HSE, which has been set up since, says we do not need that number. The T&aacute;naiste does not seem to know whether we do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a question for the Minister responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a fundamental issue of democracy involved which I want the Taoiseach to tease out for us. When there is such a conflict, who prevails &mdash; the quango or the programme for Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I resent the HSE, which employs 146,000 people, 100,000 of them full-time, in the health service being called a quango.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not call the health service a quango. The Taoiseach should not divert from the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That organisation provides the health service in this country. Obviously, we must take into account the views of the HSE. We need additional beds. The capital programme this year is &euro;500 million and next year it will be of the same order. Much of that money is providing better facilities and a large number of beds in different hospitals throughout the State. As it is probably unlikely we will get to the stage of providing all the required beds, we must continue to try to provide them. We need more beds. Our population has increased and the problems we have in accident and emergency units dictate that we need them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Professor Drumm says that we do not need them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think he says we do not need beds. He might argue about the number required and about how we use existing beds, day beds and facilities. However, he is not arguing that we do not need beds.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="803"/>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make two points. First, does the Taoiseach agree that the first paragraph of the programme for Government states that the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;overriding priority will be to secure lasting peace in Ireland through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement&rdquo;? The Government committed itself in the programme to &ldquo;the consolidation of its institutions, and the development of a spirit of friendship and cooperation between North and South ..... without prejudice to the ultimate goal of achieving a united Ireland in peace and agreement&rdquo;. Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the progress that has been made in respect of that central aim of the Government? Will he clarify the level of progress he expects will be made in that regard between now and the end of the year?</P>
        <P>Second, one of the key aims of the programme for Government is the improvement of infrastructural supports and links on an all-Ireland basis. I think the Taoiseach will agree that particularly slow progress has been made in many of these areas. I ask him to outline the progress that has been made in respect of the all-Ireland travel scheme for pensioners, which is an example of a project to which the Government committed itself, but has yet to be delivered. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the absence of progress on a full raft of important and worthwhile projects is disappointing and is setting back the overall project? I refer to the Ulster Canal project, for example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going into specific matters which are more appropriate to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am only giving instances of what I am speaking about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, Deputy, but you are being specific.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to infrastructural development projects which were committed to in the programme for Government. Is the Taoiseach aware that a study published today demonstrates the need for formal arrangements for the cross-Border delivery of accident and emergency services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only asking whether the Taoiseach is aware of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise from Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="804"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Deputy, the Chair has ruled on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There are infrastructural projects other than the construction of roads and canals. I refer to the development of essential services, for example, and the health service is an integral part of this country&rsquo;s infrastructure. As a resident of the Border region, I am deeply concerned that people in my locality do not have access to the full raft of accident and emergency services in the region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have one rule for the Deputy and another rule for other Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the Taoiseach on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s first set of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Government will demonstrate its concern for the residents of Border areas, who need the support I have mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will abide by the Chair&rsquo;s ruling by giving a broad reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s general questions. A new round of meetings with the parties is under way. It is hoped that progress can be made, although perhaps not by the end of the year. We will try to understand the concerns of the parties and to listen to their views on how we should tread forward in the new year in respect of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope we will be able to start making progress early in the new year on how best to get the institutions up and running. That will have to be our priority after the IMC report is published in January. I am sure the present round of discussions, which is based on listening to the parties, engaging with them on various issues and finding out how they would like to proceed, will prove to be useful. I am having a round of meetings. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will also be involved in meetings which will take place before the end of the month. The extent to which the various parties will engage with the process in January or early in the spring should be clear to us by the end of the month. I still believe we should hold firm to that agenda and try to move in that regard.</P>
        <P>I will comment briefly on the North-South bodies and the issues of an infrastructural nature <Col N="805"/>raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. It is enough for me to say that they are still on a care and maintenance basis and it is important that we keep them on such a basis until we get the institutions up and running again. I will not answer the specific questions asked by the Deputy, in accordance with the Chair&rsquo;s ruling, other than to mention that I outlined in a speech I made to the Institute of Directors last week how we should move forward in respect of the Ulster Canal and some other issues. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, spoke publicly about similar issues in recent speeches in Belfast and Derry. The T&aacute;naiste will visit Belfast shortly where she will discuss health issues which cover the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of school groups are in the Visitors Gallery and I am sure they are trying to follow this line of questioning. I take it we are still talking about the Government&rsquo;s third annual progress report. On that basis, is this a case of the Government assessing its own progress or has any level of independent assessment been brought to bear on this document? Is it not fair to say that this could be seen as akin to an errant student writing his or her own report card and obviously trying to put the best possible gloss on it, whether or not it is fully truthful? Would it be advisable in a report of this type to be more up-front in admitting to mistakes made, promises that perhaps should not have been made in regard to the ending of hospital waiting lists or the objective of having primary school classes of less than 20 pupils, an objective which is far from being met? I do not wish to go into greater detail as the Ceann Comhairle will tell me to ask the line Minister. The Transport 21 plan is an example of what I am talking about. This time last year the Taoiseach said the metro could not possibly be countenanced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, Deputy. Perhaps for the benefit of the Deputy I will again read out Standing Order 33.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle does not have to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Questions addressed to a member of the Government must relate to the public affairs connected to his or her Department or to matters of administration for which he or she is officially responsible.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I was trying not to fall into that trap by giving an illustration. I hoped the Ceann Comhairle might see it as such. My point is that this time last year, in regard to the last report, the Taoiseach told me we could not possibly have a metro as, to use his words: &ldquo;it would soak up the whole capital programme for the State for the <Col N="806"/>next ten years&rdquo;. I just wonder if the next progress report will be more objective and if it will face up to the fact that mistakes were made. We are all human. Nobody is saying that everybody is perfect. Would the Taoiseach not admit that mistakes have been made and lessons have been learned? People might then feel it is a more objective assessment of the Government rather than a public relations exercise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question on education, spending on education has gone up 120% in recent years and we have provided an extra 4,500 teachers and 3,000 resource teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Classes are still big.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but there has been an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio. There has also been an improvement in the capital programme and in addressing disadvantage. Smaller class sizes are being introduced, particularly for the disadvantaged. A number of improvements have taken place. As I said in reply to Deputy Kenny, one would like to achieve even more, particularly for the disadvantaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>You promised it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is happening and resources are being invested all the time. An enormous budget is being provided. In the education area much of the budget relates to people. Apart from the capital programme the bulk of funding is spent on teachers and this is improving the situation.</P>
        <P>The report indicates that 75% of what was promised in the programme for Government has been delivered. I accept there may be difficulties in completing every aspect of it. I never say there are problems that are insurmountable. The Government is always endeavouring to improve. As for things promised a few years ago, circumstances change and one must try to do more. That is the nature of the thing. I never said that everything is perfect. It is not a utopia and nobody is beyond reproach. All I ever ask is a fair examination of matters. As Deputy Sargent said, the Government provides a progress report but the people will ultimately decide. That is how it is in a democracy. That has always been the way. We have endeavoured to make improvements across the areas in the programme for Government. This country is doing extraordinarily well. There is a low level of unemployment and national debt and a high level of infrastructural spending. There have been considerable improvements in many areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There is inequality.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="807"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is some inequality but equality has improved greatly and we are high on that list. Last week a report by German economists put this country number one in Europe in these areas. We are number one in the lifestyle area. There are areas in which we are lower down the list, and I accept that. Each year we should try to improve on them. The reason for being in public life is to try to improve things. If everything was perfect, it would not be much fun being in it.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sargent asked me, on behalf of his constituents, to try to get a transport system in the next ten years not only to the airport but to Swords and north county Dublin. Now that I have done that, he is giving out to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked what the Taoiseach meant a year ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is in much better form this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My cold is gone. I apologise if I growled at Deputy Rabbitte last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No. The Taoiseach is always very polite in the face of severe provocation.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach not think the time has come to rethink the spending of &euro;665,000 on a report that is not serving its objective, which is to impress the people? It might have seemed a good idea when we were still getting accustomed to the extraordinary growth rates we have had for a dozen years but the people have grown accustomed to them now, they are paying their taxes and they expect to get results. They are interested in the things the Government is not doing rather than seeing the things it is doing being puffed up. For example, what reliance is the average citizen to place on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to implement the health strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not asking a particular question on it. Earlier the Taoiseach dealt, in considerable detail, with what Professor Drumm said about this, that and the other. One would think the Taoiseach was the Irish out half playing against the All-Blacks the way the Ceann Comhairle seeks to protect him. He is the Head of Government and he should be allowed to answer a question as such.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not protecting anybody but am applying the Standing Order as it has been applied by all my predecessors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What reliance do we place on the programme for Government in the major area of health, for example? Has the whole orientation <Col N="808"/>of the strategy changed? Are we now heading off in a different direction? If we are to go back to Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question, why does the report not state that the Government has rethought the whole health area, that the way it was going at Ballymascanlon was the wrong way, that it has changed direction under Professor Drumm, who is now making policy, and that it is going in the other direction?</P>
        <P>As regards getting Deputy Sargent to Balbriggan, the Taoiseach did not answer his question which was that if a year ago the cost of the metro would put us in hock for ten years in terms of other infrastructure projects, how come it can be thrown in now as if it were an afterthought in the middle of the &euro;34.5 billion which the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is promoting in the <i>Irish Independent </i>today. Are we now to have a series of political advertisements like we had coming up to 2002 fronted by Ministers? The Taoiseach will remember that coming up to the election in 2002, there was not a Minister in his Cabinet who did not have a radio promotion, an advertisement in the newspapers or whatever paid for by taxpayers&rsquo; money advertising public services but promoting politicians.</P>
        <P>I am happy my friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is getting a look in because between the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Cullen, it is very hard for him to do so. I am anxious he gets a look in but do we have to pay for advertisements to promote him between now and the general election? He said in the newspaper today that he will ensure there will be no snarl-up of traffic coming up to Christmas, and we are paying for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy submits a separate question on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very narrow view of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach must answer for the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. I am asking him if this is the beginning of another political splurge at the taxpayers expense.</P>

	<P>On the health issue, the Government has carefully developed the health strategy in recent years and it has implemented the structural, institutional changes by moving from the health boards to the Health Service Executive. The key changes and positions in the HSE are being organised and implemented on a national basis. None of that has been changed. It was decided that this policy, by and large, would rest with the Department of Health and Children while the <Col N="809"/>implementation and management of day-to-day activity would be the responsibility of the HSE. There is interaction daily between the Department and the HSE on a range of issues. All the initiatives that we have implemented and worked on, whether they relate to the capital programme, improving the medical card scheme, which was a major issue a year ago, or the national treatment purchase fund, which has significantly reduced waiting lists, will continue successfully.</P>
        <P>When Deputy Sargent wanted us to move on the transport infrastructure Bill a year ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the metro?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said we did not have a ten-year plan. In December 2004 the Minister for Finance said he was prepared to examine such a plan. The multi-annual programme only covered three years and there was no way to resource a ten-year programme because of the costs. However, now we examine the indicative costs based on the best assessments by the agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government found more money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Looking back over the past seven to ten years, we can see the cost of the capital programme. We are much better placed to try and deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it cheaper?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the guidelines relating to what Ministers and Ministers of State can do. Any departmental advertisement must be based on information. The announcement earlier by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, set out the arrangements for Operation Freeflow and the availability of additional transport to assist the public, as happens at this time every year. It is a public information issue.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach in his earlier reply spoke of a care and maintenance position being adopted in the absence of the restoration of the institutions. Is he aware the Secretary of State and a number of direct rule Ministers have indicated that is not the case and there is no impediment to them taking decisions on major cross-Border capital works in the absence of the restoration of the institutions? However, I agree projects would be expedited and would proceed with greater care and enthusiasm under indigenous occupants of these positions. Nevertheless, does the Taoiseach accept the use of this phraseology and the trundling out of the care and maintenance approach as an excuse for the absence of progress is not acceptable and that, under the programme for Government, there must be an enthusiastic pursuit of all the projects, including those I cited such as the Ulster Canal <i>et al</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the responsibility of a line Minister. The Deputy should be brief. Other Deputies are offering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach confirm there is ample evidence there is no impediment to progress at this stage and that progress must be made on these projects which are an integral part of what his Government promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will elaborate on my reply, as I did not seek to play down any role. The care and maintenance arrangements are in place for the present North-South bodies to keep them operating and functioning. That does not preclude action in other areas. Like the Deputy, I would prefer a different arrangement but in recent weeks and months Secretary of State Hain and his colleague, Minister of State David Hanson, have been progressive on the Ulster Canal and other projects. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has been dealing directly with this and much progress has been made on a number of issues. In fairness to Secretary of State Hain and his ministerial colleagues, they have taken a position on issues, including implementation bodies, on which we can make progress, as stated by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. Since the new administration took office it has been very forthright and we have seen movement that we did not see previously. There has been much engagement by Ministers and I hope that continues. Regarding care and maintenance for implementation bodies, it is important we keep activity on these issues moving.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="811"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>One element of Government policy which I support strongly is its attempt to introduce regulation for undocumented Irish in the United States. I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs in New York last week. The estimated figure for undocumented Irish in the United States is between 25,0000 and 50,000 out of an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants in the United States. President Bush has signed the homeland security Bill and the intention is to send every immigrant home. While there is no direct intention to remove the Irish, the view of American legislators is that regulating their situation might not be as easy as was assumed. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to have this matter regulated if possible, a position supported by every party. I suggest the Taoiseach take every opportunity to raise this matter with the American authorities. I will write to the Taoiseach on a number of issues arising from this matter that deserve Government consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s support on this issue, which is creating a high degree of frustration and concern for undocumented Irish, particularly those who left for the United States in the wave of emigration in the early 1980s. They are over 20 years in the country. As was the case last St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, I will take every opportunity to raise this issue with key figures from the administration.</P>
        <P>As I reported to the House previously, we must pursue two fronts on this issue. One concerns the legislative measures in the three proposals in the administration, between the Senate and the House of Representatives. I believe that Senator McCain&rsquo;s Bill will surface but we cannot be certain. The difficulty is that the old system of quotas no longer applies. If a quota arrangement were in place, one could lobby for a quota. We are unlikely to receive preferential treatment, as Deputy Kenny is aware from his discussions. How can we encourage the administration to make the distinction between the Mexican situation and smaller countries? It is very difficult to legislate for this situation. If there was a quota system, it would be very small in proportion to the number of immigrants there. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and all other Ministers, when meeting here or in the United States, will continue to lobby on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the review of the implementation of An Agreed Programme for Government, will the Taoiseach consider the increasing outsourcing of responsibility to other agencies? As elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, we cannot ask about these agencies on the floor of the D&aacute;il. I received a number of letters today from your good self, a Cheann Comhairle, rejecting questions I tabled for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Govern<Col N="812"/>ment on crucial issues concerning the Environmental Protection Agency and its conduct of a serious pollution issue for farmers near Askeaton. If we wish to put questions to the Taoiseach, you repeatedly direct us to the line Minister. However, when we put crucial issues to the line Minister that should be his responsibility, we are told that he has no such responsibility to the D&aacute;il. I am not on the board of the Environmental Protection Agency, I have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I should have the right to question the Minister about important issues on behalf of constituents and citizens generally, rather then being blocked in this way.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that if I had been elected to the D&aacute;il ten years ago I could have asked questions and obtained responses on this matter? Whether the answers would be satisfactory or not, I do not know, but at least I could challenge the Minister on far more crucial issues than I am allowed to do now. Is that not going in the opposite direction to democratic accountability?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is obliged to implement Standing Orders, which are based on decisions made by this House. If legislation determines that outside agencies have responsibility, the Chair must discharge its responsibility to Members of the House. I am not getting into an argument about it with the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>I call on the Taoiseach to answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think any Act states that one must not ask about this or that matter. The legislation gives the Environmental Protection Agency responsibility, but that should be subject to the Government and the Minister who are answerable to elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair implements the Standing Orders laid down by the House, Deputy. If the House is not satisfied with them, it knows what to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a fundamental point that originates from the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924. It is an 80 year old provision which has been subject to deletions and additions. In its wisdom, the legislation provides that the State believes there are areas of responsibility that are better given to outside agencies established by Acts of the Oireachtas to deal with day-to-day affairs. I am sure an audit would show that there are more, but it is not something new. The basis of the Act is that, rather than Ministers <Col N="813"/>making decisions on various matters, it should be done by others to extend protection. The legislation has been on the Statute Book for a long time and has not changed much in the interim. It still operates on the same basis as when it was enacted 81 years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the annual progress report we are discussing is, in many ways, a reinvention of the programme for Government? It is the latest manifestation of that programme as it was at that time. It has been subject to many changes to the extent that the programme for Government is a moveable feast. For example, the Luas did not join up in 1998, but is due to do so under the Transport 21 plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time to conclude Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on whether the progress report we are talking about is more of a reinvention of the programme for Government, which is not to be believed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At a cost of &euro;665, most of the third annual progress report provides a factual assessment of what progress has been made in the life of the Government through decisions based on the programme for Government, as well as giving an account of where such projects currently stand. I would have thought it was useful to provide an annual update for the Houses of the Oireachtas, the media and others who follow the affairs of this House. It is a guide to where things stand. It does not purport to be any more than a report but that is useful. We have had it for the past eight or nine years and it makes the House and Government more accountable by reporting what was said would be done and what was done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ferns Report made for some very disturbing reading because it detailed the stark reality of the abuse suffered by children and young people and the lack of support and assistance they received at their time of greatest need. The witnesses who came forward to help the <Col N="814"/>inquiry showed the strength of character and courage which has also been evident to all of us who have met survivors of abuse over the years. I register my sincere thanks and appreciation to them for without their bearing witness, the report could not have reached its findings.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the report of the Ferns inquiry that there was a general failure to recognise the terrible hurt and damage that child sexual abuse can and does cause to the victims and their families, and that prompt and effective action was not taken for many years to protect vulnerable children. As a society, we must learn from the mistakes of the past and never allow such events happen again.</P>
        <P>In addition to increasing public awareness and understanding of the horror of child sexual abuse, the Ferns Report provides practical and far-reaching recommendations to strengthen child protection measures in organisations working with children and to ensure a speedy and effective response to allegations of abuse. The Government has accepted the report&rsquo;s recommendations in principle and is committed to their implementation by Departments and relevant agencies. My Department will participate fully in the implementation process which is being driven by the National Children&rsquo;s Office under the leadership of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
        <P>Protecting the child is the fundamental imperative of this process, and ensuring this requires the full engagement of Government, church and the community. Our educational institutions and policies have a key role to play. Our approach to child abuse has changed significantly over the past 15 years. In education, we have brought in child protection guidelines for primary and post-primary schools and clearly defined procedures for reporting allegations or suspicions of child abuse. We have also sought to raise awareness of the issue in the curriculum through social, personal and health education and the Stay Safe programme. The commitment to implement the recommendations of the Ferns Report will contribute to the further strengthening of child protection measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the main points in the report, on page 260, was that some priests appear to have abused their positions as managers of boards of management to gain access to children in school. Does the Minister intend to make any changes to the procedures for appointing people to boards of management?</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister is aware that Fine Gael published proposals on vetting that would apply to teachers and people working with children in any capacity. When will the Minister come forward with her proposals and legislation in this area? Does she have any intention of bringing <Col N="815"/>that forward to include people on boards of management as well?</P>
        <P>The Ferns Report acknowledged the necessity to use soft information to stop abuse of children. In Northern Ireland this type of information is frequently used in child protection procedures. Does the Minister have any proposals to use soft information?

	<P>A school needs to ensure that anybody who has unsupervised access to children is suitable to have that access. Clear guidelines have been sent to all schools to cover working with and protecting children, which is foremost in everybody&rsquo;s mind. The vetting unit recently moved to Thurles and its numbers are being substantially increased. That will enable it to do more vetting than it does. In the context of formal education, vetting is carried out in respect of special needs assistants, bus escorts and people who work with children in detention schools. We intend with our new resources to ensure that vetting is extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children. We will be able to start that immediately once the extra resources and staffing are put in place, which I understand will be in the middle of this month.</P>
        <P>Vetting of boards of management is a wider issue because it raises the question of whether one vets people working in a voluntary capacity. Many parents and other adults help out in schools, on school tours and so on, but it is crucial to see to what extent people have unsupervised access to children. In consultation with the partners and others, we will see how best to progress this. We will be asking everyone to be vigilant. If people and schools follow the Children First guidelines, it will be clear what type of procedures they should adopt. While protecting children, we do not want to destroy volunteerism. In the first instance, the vetting will be extended to cover teachers, caretakers and bus drivers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think there is any danger that volunteerism will die because of vetting. Most youth organisations, the GAA, the National Youth Council and others have called for vetting of volunteers.</P>
        <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;Schools need to ensure&rdquo;. I accept that, but when will the necessary legislative back-up be given to schools? Guidelines are not enough in this area. We need strong legislation which is not currently provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Child protection and the implementation of the Stay Safe programme for all children in every primary school are priorities for my Department. The Stay Safe programme, also known as the child abuse prevention programme or CAPP, is a primary school-based approach to the prevention of child abuse. The programme aims to reduce vulnerability to child abuse through the provision of in-service training for teachers, parent education and personal safety education for children at primary school level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Stay Safe programme is a four-stage approach to preventing child abuse, involving children&rsquo;s safety education, teacher training, parent education and community awareness. The programme aims to give children the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse or victimisation and teaches them that they should always tell of any situation which they find unsafe, upsetting, threatening, dangerous or abusive. Stay Safe is a personal safety skills programme which can be used with primary school children from senior infants to sixth class. It seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protective skills by participating in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, touches, secrets, telling and strangers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An initial one-day in-service training seminar on the Stay Safe programme has been provided for all primary schools. Since the programme was introduced, 99.7% of primary schools have participated in this training. At present, based on a sample survey, approximately 80% to 85% of primary schools are teaching the programme to their students, but the percentage may be higher.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should be recognised that the Stay Safe programme is not mandatory and schools can decide whether to introduce it. However, the central elements of the programme, primarily personal safety strategies and, more importantly, the overall issue of child protection, are now taught as integral parts of the subject of social, personal and health education, SPHE, which is part of the <Col N="817"/>curriculum taught in every primary school. Specifically, the strand unit entitled &ldquo;safety and protection&rdquo; provides material for teachers to explore with children appropriate strategies in personal safety which incorporate elements of the Stay Safe programme. In addition, the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s child protection guidelines for all primary schools has given an additional impetus to the stay safe programme as well as the overall issue of child protection.</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a priority of my Department to ensure that a high level of awareness and the necessary skills to address child protection issues, which includes the implementation of the Stay Safe programme, is maintained in all schools. For this reason, my Department will continue to support the promotion of child protection within the context of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</P>
        <P>The current high level of take-up of the stay safe programme, combined with the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s child protection guidelines and the incorporation of the central elements of the programme, and in addition to the coverage of the overall issue of child protection within SPHE is very positive. However, I strongly encourage all schools to use the stay safe programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>While listening to the Minister, I could not help thinking how useful that programme would have been to many of the young children abused in the Ferns diocese. Why is the programme not mandatory? It is very useful because it involves giving the children skills. It also involves teachers, parents and communities. I do not understand why it cannot be made mandatory or has not been made so. Does the Minister intend to make it mandatory, or is there some obstacle which prevents the Department making it mandatory in all schools? We cannot take the risk of having children left out of such a valuable programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it is a very valuable programme and it is desirable that all schools would agree to have it implemented. As I noted, it is not just a programme administered between the classroom teacher and the children because it also involves parents, the wider community and teacher training. All those need to sign up for the programme to be part of the school. The current high take-up is very encouraging, as is the fact that we have the guidelines, and so much of the programme is now incorporated into the SPHE programme. All that is very positive.</P>
        <P>I will keep the programme under review. Over the weekend I looked at the various books for the different classes and I cannot see why anyone <Col N="818"/>would object to teaching the programme or why any parent would object to his or her child being taught the programme. It can be taught very sensitively in the context of the school ethos and I strongly encourage and recommend that all schools implement the programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just trying to find out why the Minister cannot make the programme mandatory and give a directive to all schools to implement it. I received a letter from the Catholic Primary School Management Association which said that Catholic primary schools are required to follow the national guidelines for protection following consultation with the parents with regard to the stay safe programme. From the Department&rsquo;s point of view, is enough effort being made towards ensuring that all schools follow the programme? Has the Minister any indication as to what type of schools are not in the stay safe programme or what reasons are given as to why they might not be included in the programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that teachers are very positive about the programme. The schools in which it has not been implemented are those where parents have objected to it. The reasons included a dislike of the emphasis on &ldquo;yes-no&rdquo; and a preference for &ldquo;right-wrong&rdquo; in a moral context. Some parents felt that the basis of the programme was quite dubious.</P>
        <P>In a school where the programme is offered, parents have the right not to have their children participate in it. We have evidence only with regard to about 46 children withdrawn from the programme, but 26 of those were from one school. It is clear therefore that there were particular issues in a small number of schools. I would much rather see a situation where by explaining the programme properly and bringing those parents on board, the programme could be implemented with the full co-operation of the entire school community rather than by diktat from me or the Department. We are very close to seeing the programme fully implemented. Even though I supplied a take-up figure of 80% to<?oasys _jy?>85%, I understand the INTO believes the figure to be a good deal higher. I will keep the situation under review but would prefer if the school communities themselves appreciated the value of the stay safe programme in protecting children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has been actively pursuing the acquisition of a suitable site to facilitate the construction of a permanent building for the school referred to by the Deputy. Nine sites were initially under consideration by the OPW acting on behalf of my Department. Detailed reports were received on three of these earlier this year. The report identified one of the sites as being the most suitable, subject to a geotechnical survey. Following a favourable report, negotiations were initiated with the owners, the local authority. My Department has concluded these discussions and I understand the issue will be on the agenda of a forthcoming council meeting. Upon legal finalisation of the site acquisition, my Department will seek a fast-track solution to procurement of the school building.</P>
        <P>As the board and patron are already aware, the provision of interim accommodation remains the responsibility of the school authorities until such time as a permanent solution is provided. Officials in my Department are willing to work with the school authorities in their efforts to address the interim solution and have communicated recently with the school authority in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her very clear answer. I am glad to hear there is a site and that the situation is finalised. Will this new school be included in the schools programme for 2006? Otherwise, there will be no alternative to the street for these children because the lease will expire next May and is not renewable, although the owner will allow the school to remain until June.</P>
        <P>Will these gaelscoil students face similar circumstances to the 700 illiterate students who are on the streets because the Minister left County Mayo VEC with a funding shortfall of &euro;50,000? Newspapers such as the <i>Mayo Echo</i> are double Dutch to people who cannot read. Will the Minister provide &euro;50,000 to County Mayo VEC so that these people may continue to take literacy courses? If they cannot continue, they will face life sentences in terms of being unable to read.</P><Col N="820"/>
        <P>Will the Minister include the gaelscoil in Westport in the 2006 Estimates? If she does not, its pupils will not have a school. The five prefabs that comprise their current premises are a health and safety hazard. The Minister said that once a site has been secured she will take steps to ensure that a new school is built. Will the Minister ensure that it will be included in the 2006 schools building programme so that the children will not be on the street and dependant on the VEC? Will the Minister provide the &euro;50,000 needed by the VEC for illiterate students?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>While the issues of the VEC and illiteracy do not pertain to the question in hand, the VEC in County Mayo was given its allocation and I am surprised it would choose to allow the most vulnerable to suffer. The Deputy may wish to take that matter up with the VEC.</P>
        <P>With regard to Gaelscoil na Cruaiche, I have said that we will progress the school building once a site is acquired. Naturally, because the school must leave its temporary accommodation next year, that will become a priority. A number of ways are available to us in terms of expediting the building of schools. Acquisition of a site was the main hindrance in this process but I understand that matter will be formally cleared shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>County Mayo VEC has done magnificent work and has done more than any other VEC to ensure that the maximum numbers of students attend. However, it has a shortfall of &euro;50,000. Can the Minister see a way to providing it with these funds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is up to the VEC to work within the resources it has been given. The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, already spoke to this matter on the Adjournment Debate. The resources have been provided and the VEC must decide how to allocate them.</P>

	<P>The task force on student behaviour will complete a final report, including recommendations later this year. In its interim report, the task force recognises that the most important feature of its work is to generate a set of recommendations that will impact in a positive way and will help to curtail the spread of disruptive behaviour in our schools. At its interim report stage, the task force decided to document the broad areas that are emerging to form the bedrock of its recommendations in its final report, which is <Col N="821"/>expected in December 2005. Since the task force was established early this year, it has come to grips with the breadth and complexity of this vitally important area. In tackling its job it has consulted widely and built upon submissions, research and its own analysis to define the areas on which its final report will make recommendations to underpin future change.</P>
        <P>I am particularly impressed with the ability of the task force to focus on the core issues. It has indicated to me that it is on target to produce a final report and detailed recommendations in December. Before producing that report, it wants to engage further with the wide range of interests in this area and to review what works domestically and internationally. I am greatly encouraged by this interim report and I look forward to receiving the final report and its recommendations.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of bullying in schools, the education of students in primary and post-primary schools in anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self awareness, respect for others, self esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand Myself and Others from infant classes onwards. In second-level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle in the module Belonging and Integrating.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy that includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying. I will give careful <Col N="822"/>consideration to any recommendations on bullying behaviour the task force may make in its final report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, arising from which I have further questions. Many schools are frustrated with section 29 of the Education Act 1998. I am aware that the Minister is awaiting the report of the task force but has she given any consideration to this issue in the interim? Some schools are forced to take students who have been previously expelled, which leads to a situation where students believe they can behave however they wish because the sanctions that can be applied are limited. Does the Minister plan to bring forward any legislative changes to section 29?</P>
        <P>Dr. Maria Lawlor estimated that approximately 15% of second-level students are being bullied. The Minister will be aware that it was recently estimated that up to &euro;3 billion is being lost to the Irish economy due to absenteeism and poor productivity arising from bullying. This behaviour is often learned in school yards and continues in later life.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister given any further consideration to the establishment of a national anti-bullying programme? The people who work on these matters in Trinity College believe that such a programme, which would not be particularly expensive to establish, could reduce the aforementioned 15% figure. Pilot programmes have been shown to be successful and I ask the Minister to consider their expansion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A misunderstanding seems to exist among schools in terms of the trend over recent years in the results of appeals under section 29. When these appeals were first made, a significant number undoubtedly were not favourable to schools. However, now that schools have proper procedures and policies in place, two thirds of decisions are in favour of schools and one third in favour of students. Recently, when I revealed these figures to members of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, they were surprised. The figures demonstrate that, if the correct procedures are in place, a school will be supported in its work. At the same time, we have to ensure that a child is given the opportunity to put his or her case and to receive an education. Cases are followed up with the National Education Welfare Board and welfare officers to ensure that children receive opportunities to pursue studies.</P>
        <P>Although Dr. Maeve Martin said they would not do it, I asked her to see whether change is needed in this area. The significant amount of bureaucracy which appears to be involved causes as many problems for schools as the provisions made in section 29. I have asked Dr. Martin to <Col N="823"/>determine whether recommendations should be made.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied, with the supports that have been put in place, that requiring schools to devise anti-bullying policies is the most positive manner of addressing the issue of bullying. These actions must be taken in conjunction with boards of management, teachers and students. It is a matter of getting people to sign up to the anti-bullying policy of a particular school.</P>
        <P>We funded a number of programmes, including the TCD programme mentioned by the Deputy and, this year, a summer course for participants. These pilot programmes feed into our overall policy. Rather than go down the road of adopting one or another, it is crucial that a whole school approach is involved and that it is fully integrated into the curriculum. Policies such as SPHE and curriculum development will ensure that young people focus on self esteem and respect for others. However, the other programmes help to feed into policy making.</P>

	<P>The task force is examining the effectiveness of the strategies being employed at present because good practices are in place throughout the country which can be built upon and used by others.

        <Quest>her response to calls from the National Heart Alliance for schools to play a crucial role in terms of promoting a healthy diet and adequate physical exercise for children; if she will reintroduce the sports equipment grant and ban the sale of sugary fatty energy-dense food from schools.</Quest>
        <QRef>[33077/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our schools promote, support and encourage healthy eating and physical exercise in a range of ways. Physical education is part of the curriculum at primary and at post-primary level and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will, hopefully, carry with them into adult life.</P>
        <P>With regard to educating students about making good food choices, a curriculum in social, personal and health education is mandatory for all primary students and its implementation is being assisted by a full-time support service. Health and well-being with food and nutrition are two areas <Col N="824"/>dealt with under the &ldquo;taking care of my body&rdquo; unit of that curriculum. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, pupils should be enabled to realise that they, as individuals, have some responsibility for adopting a healthy balanced diet and for taking regular and appropriate exercise.</P>
        <P>All second level schools have been required to provide SPHE as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. The aims of this programme include preparing students for responsible decision making and promoting their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from curricular provision, schools can implement measures to encourage physical activity during school breaks and schools already play a major role in promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>Together, the above initiatives ensure that children not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. I believe that schools are playing their part in terms of promoting a healthy diet and adequate physical exercise for children. However, it is important to remember that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school so schools can only do so much with regard to promoting exercise and healthy eating and the main role must rest with parents.</P>
        <P>Regarding sports equipment grants, my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools specifically for this purpose, to enable them to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for subsequent years. The question of a further grant will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years. Schools can also use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula, including physical education. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45 or &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;133.58 in the current year, an increase of almost 134% in the period.</P>
        <P>The position on the question of banning the sale of certain foods in schools is that schools are privately owned, privately managed institutions which, although funded by the State, enjoy a large degree of autonomy. It is, therefore, primarily a matter for the boards of management of individual schools to devise policies on the types of food that are available on the school premises and such policies should be driven by the needs and the welfare of the students. I know that many schools <Col N="825"/>have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents&rsquo; associations and I would encourage others to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply but I ask her to take account of what needs to be done as well as what is being done. The National Heart Alliance has called on the Department of Education and Science to take a lead role in tackling childhood obesity. The alliance should be pushing an open door in approaching the Minister with suggestions in this area, given that one in five children are obese in Ireland, while the EU average is one in six. In this context, we are closer to Boston than Berlin.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take account of the decrease in physical exercise which is reported among children from seven to 18 years. Only 49% of such children are exercising four or more times a week, down from 54%. These figures represent an average and girls are generally much worse than boys in this regard. In that context, I ask the Minister to make the case more strongly, during the Estimates process, that the physical education equipment grant scheme be reinstated and given additional resources to try to reverse the trend of fewer children taking physical exercise.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that schools are private institutions but the Department has a major influence in the running of schools. The Minister must take account of the need for a healthy food policy in all schools and for a code of practice, at both primary and secondary level, on vending machines. I understand there is a voluntary code on vending machines at primary level, but the secondary level sector also needs guidance and influence from the Department on this matter.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to be open to meeting the National Heart Alliance to discuss further practical measures, from a health and medical point of view, that may need to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two significant ways of dealing with this issue, one of which is the provision of facilities. In all major extensions and new school buildings, particularly at second level, state-of-the-art gymnasia are being installed, including, for example, a balcony area with fitness equipment, which seems to be particularly attractive to teenage girls. Even though this adds substantially to the cost of physical education halls, I have decided that we should continue with this type of development as it is a way of keeping girls involved and fit.</P>
        <P>The second way to deal with this issue is through the summer works programme. Last year, my Department provided over &euro;2.3 million for outdoor play areas for schools. This enabled them to resurface basketball courts and so on. This is an attempt to improve the facilities in schools throughout the country. The general pur<Col N="826"/>pose room in schools can also be used for physical education.</P>
        <P>A significant number of schools are now adopting a healthy eating policy and I recommend that more do so. Obviously, this is something that must be done in conjunction with parents. We cannot just ban junk food in schools and have children arriving to school with nothing. A healthy food policy must be implemented with parents&rsquo; associations, which may be guided by the schools as to what is appropriate for children.</P>
        <P>The SPHE programme, which includes information on nutrition, also includes a media awareness unit, which makes children realise how much advertising is targeted at them. It encourages children to be objective with regard to advertising. From the point of view of education, I am anxious to facilitate any initiatives that would improve the health of children. However, the parents who are looking for more time for physical education in schools are the ones who drive their children to school, collect them from school, bring them home, put them in front of a video and then give them a Gameboy for the rest of the night. A balance must be brought back into this discussion.</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister is not casting aspersions on the Minister for Transport over the lack of safe routes to school, though that is a matter to be resolved between Cabinet colleagues. During my time as a teacher, and perhaps during the Minister&rsquo;s time also, milk was provided in schools. There is a need to liaise with other Departments to provide healthier foods at schools in an attempt to reverse the habit children have acquired, perhaps through parental irresponsibility, of eating sugary energy-dense foods. The Departments of Education and Science and Agriculture and Food have a role to play in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Standardised testing on a systematic basis has great potential to enhance the quality of teaching and learning for our students at classroom level and to provide valuable information for parents about their children&rsquo;s learning. It is clear that test results, provided on a sampling basis, can guide policies aimed at improving performance and combating educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I agree with the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment that all pupils should take standardised tests in literacy and numeracy at the end of first class or at the beginning of second class and at the end of fourth class or at the beginning of fifth class, according to the wishes of individual schools.</P>
        <P>Important groundwork must be put in place before committing to specific dates for the introduction of requirements in this regard for schools. I am eager that this work be completed as soon as practicable. In that context, I have asked the NCCA to prioritise the preparation of guidelines for schools on developing and implementing a policy on assessment, assessment practice in classrooms and reporting to parents. I understand that this work is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>I have also asked the council to advance the preparation of exemplars of pupils&rsquo; work to guide teachers&rsquo; judgments and summaries based on the curriculum of what pupils should achieve at each level of their schooling. A national report card for recording and reporting data on pupils&rsquo; attainment is also being developed, as is a national policy on the transfer of information from primary to post-primary schools. In tandem with this work, my Department is exploring potential implementation models, in advance of entering into discussions with the education partners on the matter. The question of providing training to teachers on standardised testing is also an issue that has to be considered in the context of any decision to be made on an implementation date.</P>
        <P>My intention is that we will proceed carefully but as quickly as possible to ensure that the recommendations proposed by the NCCA are implemented in a way that has positive benefits for children, parents, teachers and the system as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>These proposals were initially announced by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, over a year ago. The Minister has outlined what she intends to do but has not given indications of a timeframe for completion of this project.</P>
        <P>I agree that standardised testing is important, but we need to know the base line skills of children, particularly when they are moving on to second level. The release of information in schools could be guided by standardised testing and pupils&rsquo; baseline skills coming into the system.</P><Col N="828"/>
        <P>There is much concern about how the timeframe will work and not having the test on the one day so that it does not appear like the 11 plus, which would put pressure on children at too young an age. Will the Minister address these issues? When will the testing begin? I am aware it happens in schools on a less formal level but when will the actual standardised testing begin in schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot see information from standardised testing being used in any way on the release of information. Information from standardised testing should be used for the benefit of children as learners and for the benefit of teachers. This information should be given to parents who could guide policy at national level, perhaps as a sampling basis. I would never envisage a situation where schools would be required to give information about the results of the standardised testing. I referred the matter to the NCCA for its collective advice. It was on foot of this that it suggested the two class years, at the end of first class and the beginning of second or at the end of fourth class and the beginning of fifth etc. It is important that decisions are made by local schools. The last thing we want is to have a national day of standardised testing for seven year olds, but it will be school based.</P>
        <P>There are issues that must be overcome. We discovered that schools are using 22 different tests and information is neither being collated nor used in a proper way. Obviously teachers need to be trained in dealing with the issue. We also need to ensure there are tests which are appropriate for gaelscoileanna, for which there are none at the moment. There must be examples which teachers could use. As soon as the NCCA gives me its final advice &mdash; it is at an advanced stage &mdash; I will be able to proceed with the training of teachers. I intend to move on the issue as soon as I get co-operation from the partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>On standardised testing, does the Minister agree that there appears to be an obsession with testing rather than genuine assessment in regard to primary school children in particular? Does she agree that if we go down the road of other countries, teachers will spend their school day, which in primary schools is approximately five hours per day, writing up reports, carrying out assessments and doing tests rather than providing quality teaching time, and that no attempt should be made to reduce that teaching time within the school day?</P>
        <P>When we talk about standardised testing and assessment of children, is she aware that there are children in estates throughout the country, including in my constituency of Dublin North-Central, where 52% of children are not even ready for primary school? From day one, when they enter the primary school system, they are <Col N="829"/>already years behind. Will the Minister focus the extra resources and attention on these children in these areas? When dealing with the issue of standardised testing, she should encourage teachers and parents to focus on reading and literacy as a major priority. She should focus the resources on early childhood education.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that approximately 90% of primary schools are already using some form of testing. We are aiming to ensure that teachers will use the test for the benefit of children, teachers and parents, and for the learning experience of children, not with a view to imposing further tests on children. At the moment, a number of different means are used for assessment. This will be one of them in a school context. Homework, for example, is a way of assessing children. Teachers say that the most obvious way to assess a child&rsquo;s knowledge and ability is observation, whereby they are able to witness the child&rsquo;s progress in the classroom, which is what teachers are trained to do. However, they are looking for further help and support in this regard.</P>
        <P>On early education, it has been proven that children from disadvantaged areas, in particular, depending on their family&rsquo;s literacy level, can benefit most from early education. This is why, under the new action plan for disadvantage, the DEIS programme, there will be an expansion of the number of areas which will be included in an early education programme to ensure these children can be prepared for school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where children are found to be very much below the average on these tests, will the Minister provide for some fast-track support system to give these children intensive support to bring them up to the average level? If there is no such support, the standardised testing will not achieve much for individual children who have difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the benefits of putting in place in every school in the country special needs resource learning support teachers is that these facilities are now in place. By having these tests, teachers will be able to identify more accurately and more quickly the children who need extra support and, therefore, they will be able to refer them to the resource teacher who will be present in the school. This means the needs of the child will be met quickly without having to depend on psychological reports.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the way in which Irish music, dance and culture is catered for in the primary school curriculum; if same is being implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[32771/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a major emphasis in the primary school curriculum on our Irish culture, including music and dance. Pupils are encouraged to develop an awareness of Irish customs and traditions and to deepen their appreciation of the Irish identity. Throughout the curriculum and the accompanying guidelines, there are numerous examples and suggested learning experiences that draw on the Irish cultural environment and emphasise our heritage, games, music and dance.</P>
        <P>The curriculum places value on our Irish culture in the context of growing diversity among the pupil population and the importance of respecting and celebrating the cultures of others. Language is a powerful medium through which pupils acquire an awareness of culture. The primary school curriculum is built on the right of all children, from the beginning of schooling, to experience language learning in both English and Irish. An appropriate experience of both languages has an important contribution to make to the development of the child&rsquo;s cultural awareness and sense of cultural identity. The Irish language is at the core of our heritage and the most obvious aspect of our Irish culture. One of the main aims of the Irish curriculum in the primary school is to develop cultural awareness. Learning the Irish language enables the child to connect with that culture, its literature, folklore and music. In the teaching of English, children are encouraged to read and respond to a wide range of literature and poetry, including the works of Irish authors.</P>
        <P>The emphasis on Irish culture permeates other curriculum areas also. For example, in the visual arts, pupils are taught to look at and respond to Irish works and in history the child&rsquo;s learning about &ldquo;myself and my family&rdquo; might focus on feasts, festivals and lifestyles of the past. Among the objectives of the music curriculum is the development of an awareness and appreciation of song and traditional Irish instruments. The tin whistle is recommended as one of several suitable means by which pupils can achieve appropriate levels of mastery in the production of music. Dance is a strand of the physical education curriculum and one of its learning objectives include enabling children to perform dances with confidence and competence, including simple folk and Irish dances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the delivery of the in-service seminars for music in the 2004-05 school year, specific emphasis was placed on raising teachers&rsquo; awareness of as many resources as possible for the <Col N="831"/>teaching of Irish music. In addition, the Irish Recorded Music Association Trust presented a tin whistle to every teacher in the country. Dance is one of the three strands being presented to teachers during this year&rsquo;s in-service in physical education. Irish dance is a particular focus and teachers get opportunities to practise set dancing during the in-service seminars.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While her response sounded quite impressive, is she satisfied that this is being implemented? I ask the question in the context of having encountered young children in various parts of the country in recent years who appear not to have the wherewithal to sing an old traditional Irish song like B&aacute;id&iacute;n Fheilim&iacute; or Poc ar Buile. It appears to be something we have encased away and emphasis is not being placed on it in primary schools as was the case heretofore. How will the Minister ensure this part of the curriculum is being implemented, because I am of the opinion that this is not being done? Will she agree that there may be merit in the concept of considering specialised teachers in this regard? One cannot expect every primary teacher to be an Enya or a Michael Flatley, but some teachers have an ability in this area. Will she consider providing specialised teachers who would service several schools, instead of expecting teachers to be Jack of all trades, which many of them are not?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been a great pleasure for me over the past year or so to visit more than 200 schools. I am usually impressed by the emphasis being put on dance, singing and the Irish language. While one will get the Mamas and the Papas, and other such songs, in perfect harmony, one will also get the traditional Irish songs. I witnessed wonderful Irish dancing in Monaghan without the wigs and glittery costumes. I have also seen a great seisi&uacute;n in Wexford. Tin whistles and the recorder are very popular. Obviously the culture and the environment of the community play a huge part. If traditional music is strong in a particular area, it permeates into the school. I opened a school extension in Glenamaddy recently where one of the traditional singers from the town taught the songs of Glenamaddy. That is useful interaction.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with the idea of having specialist teachers who come in just to teach music because it is a central part of the training of the primary school teacher. The emphasis and basis of train<Col N="832"/>ing primary school teachers is that they are multidisciplinary. However, one will find that teachers co-operate with each other and may, perhaps, bring the two first classes together. One who is good at sport will take one group and another who is good at music will take the other.</P>
        <P>I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from. In some areas, because of multiculturalism in our schools, the amount of time spent on Irish culture may be diluted to compensate for the broadening of other cultures. In its own way that can be positive because it can ensure that the Irish student looking at his or her Irish culture will appreciate it even more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister correctly mentioned that some areas that do not have a tradition of Irish music, dance and so on may not have it in the schools. Does the Department have any indication or mapping of these areas? Traditionally, there are areas where it is not strong and it is not taught in the schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not have mapping of the areas involved. That is obviously a wider cultural issue for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. One may not think that my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, formerly Kingstown, would be a hotbed of great Irish culture, yet Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute;&Eacute;ireann has its headquarters there and hundreds of children attend every week for traditional music. Also the first gaelscoil was set up there. It is difficult to identify an area where a particular culture may be strong or otherwise. I know everybody puts on a good show when the Minister turns up but it certainly shows a talent among the teachers who encourage the children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of Irish music and dance in primary and secondary schools, there is already a huge resource within some schools which are examples of good practice. Deputy Timmins&rsquo; question is relevant because there are some schools that may not necessarily have the same examples of good practice in respect of Irish music, dance and all other aspects of the arts. Perhaps the Minister would use the resource of schools that already have an excellent programme running to assist those schools that may not necessarily have such a programme. In some of the poorer schools in the city there are great examples of Irish dance and dance from different nationalities and respect for cultural diversity. There are some creative teachers who implement these policies in schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy. It has no bearing on the position of the school or the socioeconomic breakdown of the school as to what type of culture is taught or the involvement of the children. However, much depends on the interest of the teacher. That is the reason the <Col N="833"/>summer programmes, the summer schools and literacy through the arts are hugely important for encouraging the teacher to pass on the skills.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the design process for new school buildings or where an existing school building is undergoing major refurbishment. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20- ?><P Just="Left">In regard to specific sports equipment grants, my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools specifically for this purpose to enable them to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for subsequent years. The question of a further grant will be kept under review.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0- ?><P>Schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula, including physical education. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45 per pupil to &euro;133.58 in the current year, an increase of almost 134% in the period. Also, all primary schools with permanent recognition receive an annual minor works grant from my Department. Each school gets a standard rate of &euro;3,809 plus a per pupil rate of &euro;12.70. Special schools and schools with special classes receive an enhanced per pupil rate of &euro;50.80. It is open to school management authorities to use this devolved grant for the purchase of equipment, including physical education equipment, provided it is not required for more urgent works. My Department also considers applications for additional grant aid for such equipment where schools can demonstrate that the minor works grant funding is insufficient for this purpose.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee on Education and Science did a report, for which I was rapporteur, on physical education, one of the recommendations of which was that there would be a specific period of specialised funding for PE, similar to that provided for information technology. Has the Minister considered that recommendation? Deputy Sargent tabled a question on promoting a healthy diet in schools. We must accept that part of this must be done in the PE section of the school curriculum. Some primary schools are doing a good job but others do not have the facilities. While the building programme is still under pressure in terms of applications, I cannot foresee a time when only PE buildings will be used for that purpose. In light of the Estimates I ask the Minister to consider a specific period of specialised funding for PE in schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from. Despite the fact that we are spending almost &euro;500 million this year, stand-alone PE halls are still only a priority four. When one weighs up the needs throughout the country for classrooms, new schools, buildings for special schools, special units and so on, I cannot prioritise stand-alone sports halls any higher. We are building them in the context of new schools and major new extensions.</P>
        <P>Equally, where there is any new major extension to primary schools, they get large general purpose areas. A number of schools had to sacrifice their GP room when there was a shortage of classrooms. As their needs are met with extra classrooms, such as the new scheme introduced this year of permanent accommodation where schools have applied for a permanent accommodation grant to add on an extra classroom, they will then be able to retrieve their GP room. For the moment I do not envisage being able to set aside money which would be to the detriment of schools getting classrooms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister had any formal discussions with her Cabinet colleague in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism with a view to ensuring that if he provides a grant to a club, those facilities would be accessible to a school? I appreciate that is being done on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis but will the Minister have more formal negotiations with her colleague with a view to ensuring a better allocation of resources? Perhaps it could be made mandatory in giving a grant that the facilities would be available to local schools.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have had a number of discussions with and good co-operation from my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue. In some local areas there is good co-operation between sports clubs and the schools. Where there is not co-operation, there can be terrible enmity and jealousy between <Col N="835"/>schools in the one town. If one school happens to get a new building and a PE hall with it, the other school demands another PE hall. I know of one town where two new schools got two PE halls and now the third school is insisting on a PE hall. There are only 7,000 people in the whole town and yet there is no co-operation between the schools on the issue. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is doing an audit throughout the country on what sporting facilities are available in different towns. We hope to build on that, fill the gaps and ensure co-operation between everybody.</P>

	<P>The involvement of priests with national schools has generally been in the role of chairperson of the board of management or as visiting priest assisting a class teacher in the provision of religious instruction, for example, in preparation for First Communion or Confirmation. The rules for national schools require that the chairpersons of the boards of management visit their schools regularly and satisfy themselves that the rules for national schools are being complied with. The timetable for primary schools provides for a period of 30 minutes per day for the teaching of religion. While the teaching of this subject would be a matter for the class teacher, the teacher may invite the clergy of the relevant denomination to visit the class during this period if they so wish.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the claims made by the One in Four group in so far as they have been reported in the media. I understand they relate to concerns about certain priests with a propensity for child abuse having had access to children in national schools primarily in the inner city of Dublin in the 1980s. Obviously, if there are particular con<Col N="836"/>cerns in this regard they would need to be investigated fully. We now know from the Ferns inquiry the awful reality of how persons, who were accorded a position of trust in the community, wilfully abused that position to visit the horror of child sexual abuse on their victims with such damaging consequences for them and their families.</P>

It is not clear from her response. The One in Four group has suggested that children from a deprived or working class background were taken out. The governor of Mountjoy Prison often talks about the usual groups and communities from which people come. Many of the children abused at school went to institutions at which they were again abused and ended up in prisons where they were also abused. I am trying to ascertain the information the Minister has on the abuse that appears to have happened in the past.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the Ferns Inquiry and as a society we must learn from what happened in the past. However, if this information is not in the Department of Education and Science, should we look to abuser groups to place this information on the public record or should Departments such as the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children come out openly and accept the problems that existed in the past and hopefully learn from it?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have spoken to Marie Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin and have indicated to her that unfor<Col N="837"/>tunately I am not in a position to add that mother and baby home to the Schedule because the State did not have any inspection role in that home at that time. It therefore cannot be included. Obviously she is very upset over this matter. I did not want her to suffer any further in anticipation that something could happen. However, I am precluded from doing it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Understanding the relationship between the schools and how abuse took place is important. Will the Minister reconsider allowing the Department of Education and Science to provide copies of material regarding special schools to the National Archives of Ireland, which does not have material from special schools because it is being used for the redress board? Copies rather than originals could be supplied. It is very important that as much information as possible is put into the public arena to maximise protection and understand the relationship between the State and those schools.</P>

	<P>The Deputy gave the reasons we cannot hand over that documentation. Normally documentation would be supplied after 30 years. However, because it is in use by the redress board we cannot hand it over. As soon as the board&rsquo;s work is complete we will be happy to ensure that information is made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Taoiseach is aware, thousands of farmers took to the streets today in protest at the European Commission proposals for the next round of the World Trade Organisation talks which will take place in Hong Kong in December. Farming is the one sector in Ireland not to have felt the benefit of the Celtic tiger as it should have. In 1977 the country had 130,000 full-time farmers and this number has reduced by 17,000 to 113,000 full-time farmers now. Since 1997 when the Taoiseach came to office, 50 full-time farmers have left the land each week. The average income in 1997 was &euro;14,000. Since then in many cases farmers&rsquo; incomes have reduced and average farming income now stands at just &euro;15,000 while the average industrial wage is at &euro;30,000 per annum.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach should be aware that the farming community is very fearful of the proposals made by the European Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson, who has proposed cuts in tariffs of up to 60% in some areas. These proposals would spell the end for small and medium-sized farmers in Ireland and throughout the EU, and could cost the Irish food sector &euro;800 million. The farming community was given clear assurances during the lead-up to the CAP reform in 2003 that that reform would form the negotiating position for the WTO talks in December 2005. Irish farmers signed up for CAP reform with the then Commissioner, Mr. Fischler, on that basis. They are now being told they will need to accept more cuts. The ink had hardly dried on the Fischler pro<Col N="839"/>posals and the cheques had barely started to come through, and they are now being told there is no certainty that these will deliver for farmers.</P>
      <P>Can I take it that the Irish Government will work with other EU countries to stop proposals on the basis that they go too far and will decimate Irish farming? Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Irish European Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy? What is his view from the Commission in respect of the proposals made by the European Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy said, the negotiations in this matter have been going on for some considerable time. There has been a series of rounds of discussions both within the European Union and with the Americans. Throughout these negotiations we have taken the line that we are in favour of a successful round in the World Trade Organisation talks. We want to see the Doha round concluded. For the sake of trade and trade liberalisation, and to allow for world trade particularly for developing countries we want this round to be successful. We have been adamant in our position that the negotiations of 2003 which led to the latest round of CAP, building on the 1992 round, and the three other negotiations of CAP in recent years should not be given away. As the Deputy knows, we have had some disagreement in these negotiations with the European Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson.</P>
      <P>Our view on the negotiations is that we have already given a significant round of concessions in the 2003 agreement. Therefore, our opening position should be that there is no need for us to give further breaks and changes, pending what the Americans will or will not give. The Americans have a different view and have been lobbied extensively on it. There have been several meetings on this, right up to yesterday&rsquo;s round. Yesterday, we were supported by the French, the Greeks and the Cypriots in the discussions. We will continue to put forward our position. At the European Council meeting two weeks ago in Hampton Court both the French President and I, and to a lesser extent other countries, continued our strong opposition to this and supported sticking to the CAP position. As Deputy Kenny knows, there is not a strong lobby on our position within the 25 countries, but we have held the line firmly.</P>
      <P>Not to pick up Deputy Kenny, but to make the point as I see it and have held in negotiations, I do not believe it was an &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; in the 2003 discussions. It was a commitment. Those discussions were based on a commitment that would go into the next Doha round. It is incorrect, as we established in the meetings with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, for Mr. Mandelson to <Col N="840"/>feel obliged to give anything further on this. Our commitment was in the decoupling arrangements of 2003. I have argued strongly for the cause of Irish farmers on this. I have argued vehemently in opposition to many of the multinationals in this country who take the trade view. I continue to do that and have spoken to many of the presidents of multinationals here to outline why the issue of CAP reform is so important to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Very few people comprehend what is going on or that a small handful of people behind closed doors make these decisions. I recall that at the end of 1996 I was involved in these trade talks in Singapore on behalf of the European Community.</P>
      <P>This issue opens a much broader social and moral question about how much we value the need to have a domestic food sector here the quality and safety of which we can be assured. When we put profit before quality, we threaten our food supply and bio-security. These reforms will open the floodgates in Europe to a significantly increased market from, for example, Brazil, whose produce is often of a lesser standard and quality than we would employ. This must remain a source of concern to us. The public must face up to the debate on whether we want food to come from factory farms or hypermarkets, where consumers cannot be assured of traceability, origins or standards of production. We cannot allow imported food products such as beef that does not satisfy the same high standards we demand of our farmers to be sold in Irish retail outfits.</P>
      <P>This is an issue of social and moral consequence. Consumers must be assured that the food they consume is of the highest standard. The current proposals will weaken bio-security and the safety of food for all consumers. Does the Taoiseach share my view that the European Commission needs to revisit these proposals, that if it does not, the proposals will decimate Irish farming and expose the consumer to food production practices of doubtful quality and lower safety standards than we have and if implemented, will introduce a regime of cheap food policy? The Government should declare its position openly and clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Commissioner Mandelson has stated, following the special meeting attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, that he would stick to the mandate of 2003. The issue was that he should not go outside that mandate. If we gave away too much, it would help Brazil particularly, and other countries. While we want a liberated trade agreement that helps trade all over the world and deals with tariffs and exports, we do not want one that damages European farming or the Irish position <Col N="841"/>and what was negotiated in the last round of the 2003 agreement.</P>
      <P>We are not opposed to changes in the food regime. Part of our negotiating position for several years has been that we help developing countries, particularly the least developed countries. We have been supportive of allowing imports from developing countries into Europe. Europe now has the best record in the world of giving an opportunity to developing countries. This campaign has been fought by NGOs for some years and we have supported it. These imports must live up to the quality standards of the EU. An important point about the CAP, which is not always understood by some of the biggest countries in Europe, is that it provides us with the advantage of good food arrangements, good hygiene standards and good quality. I agree that is hugely important. We have argued this point throughout the discussions.</P>
      <P>On domestic supports, the European Union has carried out a radical reform of CAP by decoupling direct payments. That is the position we continue to outline in the talks. We have outlined a strong position, but we are in a minority on that position. We will continue to outline it. It is put forward by some that to be pro agriculture is anti trade or business, and Deputy Kenny raised this issue. We want a balanced agreement. Irish agriculture has gone through three rounds of reforms in the past 15 years and we have given quite a deal in that time. We should not have to give more on the basis of an arrangement where others might give something but have not got agreement for it. I, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for trade, Deputy Michael Ahern, have been involved in numerous discussions. It is our view that we should not go outside our mandate and we will continue to hold that position in the weeks ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach will join me in deploring the circumstances in which 13 Latvian workers were abandoned on a small island off the coast of Skerries. This is part of a pattern. It is the latest, but most extreme example of the casual regular everyday exploitation of immigrant workers, in particular poorly paid workers.</P>
      <P>The case history is well established. In the case of Gama, it was due to official policy &mdash; sponsored invitation from the Minister of the day to that company. The Taoiseach has made his views known in the House on the case of Irish Ferries, where Irish workers were displaced by cheap labour, but I am not sure he has managed to do anything about it. There is a dispute ongoing in Doyle Concrete, in Rathangan, in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Wall, where <Col N="842"/>workers have been disemployed to allow for the employment of cheap labour. We have had some horrific cases of abuse of migrant workers in domestic service, who are excluded from the terms of the Employment Equality Act. Domestic service was not a phenomenon at the time it was enacted.</P>
      <P>One of the latest cases I know of from the rights commissioner is that two workers employed for only three weeks were found to have been cheated out of &euro;7,000. It is unclear whether the money will be paid to the people in question on foot of the rights commissioner&rsquo;s findings. In another case, a person who worked on a mushroom farm for 12 hours a day, seven days a week, was paid half the minimum wage rate. Such cases are part of a pattern.</P>
      <P>The number of inspections carried out by the labour inspectorate decreased from 8,373 in 2002 to 5,160 last year. Four new inspectors have been appointed to the labour inspectorate, bringing the total number of inspectors from sixteen and a half to twenty and a half. There is less than one inspector for every 100,000 workers. There is less than one per county. Every county has a dog warden, but not every county has a labour inspector. The number of labour inspectors is inadequate to force compliance with employment legislation and to tackle the phenomenon I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Rabbitte in condemning the actions of an employer of some sort, who abandoned a group of Latvians on an island off Skerries at the weekend. The status of the employer in question is not quite clear from the reports I have been given, although I have received a name. The people in question were abandoned off Shenick&rsquo;s Island, which is half a mile from the coast of County Dublin. They would have had to stay on the island overnight if it were not for the assistance of the Skerries lifeboat and the marine co-ordination centre. I have received a report outlining the details of what happened in this case, but it will probably be tomorrow before more detailed reports are available to me. A number of parties, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health and Safety Authority, the marine inspectorate and the labour inspectorate, have started to investigate the incident over the past day or two. One of the issues being examined is whether the employer in question had a licence to engage in activity of this nature. If he was involved in some formal way in the production for sale of periwinkles, which I presume he was, he was subject to many Acts and may well have been in breach of them. Such matters are being followed up and examined by the various relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>I am keeping in close touch with developments in respect of Irish Ferries. The latest position is that the unions met yesterday and it is expected that the court will issue its determination shortly. <Col N="843"/>Both sides restated their positions yesterday but did not engage in negotiations, unfortunately.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred specifically to the labour inspectorate. The recently recruited cohort of inspectors will be allocated specifically to areas of employment dominated by migrant workers, such as cleaning, agriculture and services. The Government provided funding at the end of April to meet the cost of an additional ten labour inspectors and a supervisor, to be appointed to work mainly in that area. The interviews have been completed and some inspectors have been employed. When they are all in place, there will be a total of 31 labour inspectors. The Deputy was correct to state that fewer inspections have been conducted this year than last year. The decrease took place when a number of inspectors were taken from other work and asked to examine certain issues relating to Gama Construction. That was the right thing to do at the time.</P>
      <P>Although most employers, including those who employ workers from the new EU member states, follow the rules and obey the laws, there are breaches. We have to use the additional inspectors being recruited to work on such cases. I hope that will be enough. Some 8,000 inspections were conducted each year under the old system. Extra work has had to be done on the detailed inspections. The Minister will keep the system under review. I deplore the breaches of the law to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputy Rabbitte and certain people outside the House that the Government decided last year to allow people from the new EU member states to work in this country from 1 May 2004. That decision was taken to help the position of the Irish labour market and to deal with the fact that we had full employment, in effect. We were confident that laws were in place to ensure that such people were treated properly. It behoves everybody to obey the laws to which I refer. We have to come down extremely heavily on employers who are in breach of those laws. The Government is in the process of increasing the number of labour inspectors from 20 to 31. I hope that will make an impact. I will give Deputy Rabbitte the full details on this issue as soon as I have them, but it will probably be tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we deal with the facts? The number of labour inspectors has not yet been increased from 20 to 31. A recent response to a parliamentary question made it clear that there were sixteen and a half inspectors. Just four of the ten new posts mentioned by the Taoiseach have been filled. Therefore, there are twenty and a half labour inspectors, in my language. We are not talking about the complement &mdash; we are talking about the number of labour inspectors actually in the service. I would like to comment on the report submitted by the labour inspectorate <Col N="844"/>to the Government. According to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 April last:</P>
      <P LI="1">Lack of staff, resources, training and legal support is hampering the pursuit of employers who exploit their workers, labour inspectors have told the Government. Confusing legislation, inadequate powers, ambiguous targets and a lack of clarity on their roles are also hindering their work, the inspectors say in a confidential document [submitted to the Government].</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is the actual position. We are facilitating the development of an underclass of cheap labour in this economy. We can see on our television screens the implications elsewhere in western Europe of alienating an underclass who are abused.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people from other countries, who are working in domestic service, are prisoners in the homes of this country&rsquo;s <i>nouveaux riches</i>. They are being exploited and abused as they work for long hours to do the most menial of tasks for the poorest of pay. Such abuse is not confined to sections of the construction industry, Irish Ferries and Gama Construction. The Minister promised portable work permits, but the Bill that was brought to the House did not measure up to the Minister&rsquo;s promises. The work permits that will be issued to people from other countries under the Bill will not be portable. The proposed legislation is an inadequate improvement on the existing position. Even if the 31 labour inspectors were in place &mdash; they are not in place &mdash; there would be little more than one inspector for every 100,000 workers. We need to take action if we do not want to build problems for ourselves. The casual replacement of workers taking place in Rathangan shows that the policy being pursued at Irish Ferries is catching on. It is possible to casually replace a number of indigenous or other workers with cheap labour. We need to address such matters now and to show the foresight that will help us to avoid the kind of problems being encountered in the suburbs of Paris and elsewhere.</P>

	<P>For shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the reason they are not all in place is due to the difficulty in getting people to take up this kind of work. People have been interviewed for the jobs. Dealing with this end of the labour market is not seen as a very attractive profession even though the remuneration is quite good. We must deal with this issue. It is believed that we can tackle it when we have <Col N="846"/>31 inspectors. We will try to get them in place as soon as possible. I have been checking on the matter both this morning and yesterday since I saw the reports on this particular issue.</P>
      <P>In some cases where there is a vacancy in a workplace an individual from Latvia, Lithuania or Poland is taken on. That is not a case of displacing an Irish worker. Where there is blatant displacement by an employer, it should be reported. We can examine those issues. We would take a very dim view of a campaign by some employers to improve their margins by getting rid of Irish workers and replacing them with workers on lower earnings. That is a different issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a well known fact that it is nearly impossible to get an Irish person to work in the meat industry. Let us not start confusing the issue. If people are abusing the system or there are sectors we have not covered, I am in favour of doing whatever is necessary in that regard, but a host of legislative measures already exist. When I inquired today about the legislative measures in place to deal with this action over the weekend, I was informed that approximately 25 laws are in place to deal with the person concerned in the area of food, the marine, hygiene and safety. A host of legislation is in place. If issues are reported, there is a process for dealing with them in a range of areas. The particular individual in question is being investigated in five different areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a report published today by public health researchers in Trinity College has analysed the travel distance and travel time of people <Col N="847"/>accessing health care and that the data have been gathered from throughout the country? The report shows that people living in parts of County Donegal, all of County Leitrim, the western part of County Cavan and throughout County Monaghan are at a major disadvantage as far as accident and emergency service access is concerned. The report calls for a formal and structured arrangement for the integration of accident and emergency services along the Border, not only to serve the needs of those in the counties I mentioned but also their counterparts living directly opposite on the northern side of the Border. Through such a structured arrangement, people would have quicker access to emergency services, especially accident and emergency services.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach urge the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to act on this report and to step up formal co-operation on health services generally on a North-South basis? In the course of Taoiseach&rsquo;s Question Time he acknowledged the importance of North-South co-operation. In light of this report I also ask the Taoiseach to urge the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to restore accident and emergency cover on a 24-7 basis at Monaghan General Hospital as an integral part of this address in the interests of all the people of County Monaghan.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I recently had personal experience of a quite serious road traffic accident just north of the Border from County Monaghan in County Fermanagh. The experience was very disturbing. No emergency service arrived at the scene of the accident for almost two hours despite repeated calls. The Garda would not come 200 yards across the bridge to attend the accident and it was almost two hours before the PSNI attended the scene. No ambulance came in response to the calls to the emergency services, although one happened on the scene after an hour and 40 minutes by chance as it travelled on an errand between Monaghan and Cavan hospitals. Two of the people involved in the accident, including the driver who was aged more than 70 years and was suffering from chest injuries, were left at the scene of the accident for a considerable time. They were subsequently brought to hospital and detained overnight.</P>
      <P>There are many instances of this type of experience along the Border. I urge the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to exercise themselves to ensure we have an equitable health service in the Border counties and one that is truly caring and accessible. The report today from the Trinity College researchers confirms the importance of action before there are further unnecessary fatalities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The report stated that those people who are not close to hospital services, especially those in rural communities, must travel greater distances. That is stating the obvious. I will not go into the situation at Monaghan General Hospital again. There are hospitals in the area and an examination is being carried out into the best clinical and medical ways of dealing with the health needs in the area. Discussions are taking place on that matter. Discussions are also taking place between clinicians and management in Letterkenny General Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry to seek to develop services, particularly breast cancer services. An application for a consultant general surgeon with a special interest in these issues is under consideration by the National Hospitals Office. A new dedicated transport service has been established for patients travelling from Sligo to University College Hospital Galway.</P>
      <P>Obviously we will do what we can to improve the travel arrangements for people to hospitals, either in Border areas or anywhere else in the country. The investment that has been made in many regional hospitals in facilities will help in that regard, as will the appointment of additional consultants in many of these areas. Obviously, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive will continue to do all they can to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer lacks any substance. It is imperative that he listens to the cry of the people because a great need exists. This is the reality of their experience. Will the Taoiseach insist that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children initiate whatever formalised and structured arrangements are necessary to improve the accident and emergency cover in the Border counties? Will he help ensure greater integration of accident and emergency provision in the Border counties, of which the Monaghan case is one that is integral and cannot be divorced from the overall need and requirement along the Border from the Cooley Peninsula to the Inishowen Peninsula? The Taoiseach&rsquo;s colleagues in Government are very aware that such an integrated approach is essential to save lives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>My time has concluded but I ask the Taoiseach not to conclude on this issue. It is important that he listens and recognises that people are putting forward a cogent argument that has been supported by sustained inquiry from professional and informed people. This latest report is yet another example of the body of work that argues and sustains the argument for an integrated and co-operative approach <Col N="849"/>to accident and emergency cover in the Border counties. I again state, without apology, the importance of the restoration of 24-seven accident and emergency cover at Monaghan General Hospital. Will the Taoiseach do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To specifically answer the Deputy &mdash; I may have been too general &mdash; all the hospitals, Letterkenny, Sligo, Omagh, Daisy Hill in Newry, Cavan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Monaghan, are trying to work in co-operation. That is why I mentioned the efforts with Altnagelvin and Daisy Hill. We are very anxious to work with them. The T&aacute;naiste is due to have meetings next week or the week after with the medics in the North about further co-operation. We are in favour of that and of trying to improve the services and facilities.</P>
      <P>As has been stated, one cannot have everything in every hospital, but one must try to ensure we have a good service across all these areas as well as in other rural areas. We are committed to doing that and it is happening. A large number of the additional accident and emergency consultants have been appointed to these hospitals and we are making efforts to try to continue to do that.</P>
      <P>Over the past four or five years much work has been done on a North-South basis. We are trying to increase co-operation where it makes sense to do so to avoid the type of case the Deputy mentioned where neither service responded to an incident.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 36, lines 5 and 6, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 5 down to and including &ldquo;1996&rdquo; in line 6 and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 178(1)(a)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Social Welfare Act 1996 provided for the introduction of the one-parent family payment which subsumed a variety of schemes applicable at the time to persons rearing children alone. That Act also repealed the provisions governing the deserted wives&rsquo; benefit, deserted wives&rsquo; allowance and prisoners&rsquo; wives allowance schemes. In addition, the 1996 Act incorporated a saver clause which allowed for the continued payment of deserted wives&rsquo; benefit, deserted wives&rsquo; allowance or prisoners&rsquo; wives allowance for as long as the recipient retained a continuous entitlement under the relevant scheme.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, an amendment was introduced to incorporate this saver provision into the text of the Bill. As a consequence of this amendment, a small number of references in the Bill require adjustment and these amendments provide for the necessary reference updating.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should not start with such comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been the subject of some of them myself, so I know what it is like. Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan is extremely adept at dealing with this area and the Minister gave him credit for some of the points he made on Committee Stage. Deputy Ryan will be speaking on this matter later and I certainly do not wish to hijack something in which he has a deep interest and has outlined extremely well. Will the Minister take cognisance of the anomaly whereby a recipient of deserted wives&rsquo; benefit can have her payment reduced by more than &euro;1,600 per annum for every &euro;1,270 per annum gross earned in excess of &euro;12,697, which is &euro;10,000 per annum? We are aware that the entire system changed in 1997 when the one-parent family scheme was introduced, but Deputy Ryan has consistently raised the anomaly involved because the scheme became means-tested. Does the Minister agree that the anomaly is unjust? The thrust of the deserted wives&rsquo; benefit is that nobody should be worse off as a result of this anomaly which we now have a chance to remove. It would be a glaring omission, indeed a sin, on our behalf if we failed to remove this anomaly. Only the Minister can deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>I received a lovely letter from the Ceann Comhairle this morning &mdash; they are certainly not cheques when they arrive from him &mdash; ruling my <Col N="862"/>amendment No. 3 out of order. The deserted wives&rsquo; benefit scheme closed off new applications with effect from 2 January 1997 when the one-parent family scheme was introduced through the Social Welfare Act 1996. No new applications were received after that date. At the time the deserted wives&rsquo; benefit scheme was abolished, a woman in receipt of it would continue to receive the payment for as long as she had a continuous entitlement to the deserted wives&rsquo; benefit. We now have a major anomaly, however, whereby it involves more than a euro for euro reduction. It would leave us open to significant criticism if we failed to address this matter in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The thrust of amendment No. 3, which was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, was to address this anomaly. I do not know why it was ruled out of order. We want it reviewed to force a debate on the floor of the House and to ensure the Minister is fully aware that this anomaly constitutes a grossly unjust measure. The persons affected will be worse off, losing &euro;1,600 after earning &euro;1,270. It does not make sense so I ask the Minister to address that matter.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan, would like to contribute because he has expertise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Boyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give way to Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to debate this matter, albeit in a roundabout way. The Minister has acknowledged that there was a deficiency in the original Bill which deleted all reference to deserted wives&rsquo; benefit. In dealing with this issue, the Minister and his officials will acknowledge that there is an anomaly. If that is the case, we should endeavour to deal with it. We are talking about approximately 300 people. The anomaly arises where a recipient of the deserted wives&rsquo; benefit loses at least &euro;1,600 per annum for each &euro;1,269.74 per annum earned in excess of &euro;12,697.38 per annum. In that context, does the Minister agree that the means bands need to be adjusted as a matter of urgency?</P>
      <P>I also refer the Minister to the information provided by his Department, which gives a direct comparison between the earnings limits for deserted wives&rsquo; benefit and the one-parent family payment. The two payments are not comparable, however. The deserted wives&rsquo; benefit is an insurance-based payment &mdash; such payments generally speaking are not means-tested &mdash; with the same contributory conditions and payment rates as the widows&rsquo; contributory pension. Therefore, there was a linkage all along. When the system was changed, it was linked to one-parent family payments with an earnings limit. It was only given <Col N="863"/>to women who had been deserted by their husbands, not to people who voluntarily separated. The marriage breakdown aspect was investigated in all cases by an inspector of the Department. Many claims were rejected on the basis that husbands did not leave of their own volition.</P>
      <P>Given the linkage between the deserted wives&rsquo; benefit and the contributory widow&rsquo;s pension, we must note that no earnings limit applies to the latter payment. This situation concerns a small group of people who were deserted. The deserted wives&rsquo; benefit scheme was closed off to new applicants with effect from 2 January 1997 when the one-parent family payment was introduced under the Social Welfare Act 1996. As no new applications for the scheme were accepted after that date, this would not have a knock-on effect on new applicants. A woman in receipt of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit at the time the scheme was abolished was told she would continue to receive the payment for as long as she had continuous entitlements to it. In effect, however, that has not happened because the bands were not increased.</P>
      <P>If someone wants to go out to work to improve her lot, she will suffer a considerable loss. I do not know whether it is possible to achieve this change in the context of the Consolidation Bill. A relatively large number of people from the small group that exists have informed me that they are being hard done by. Officials in the Department unofficially acknowledge that an anomaly exists but they also say that there will not be much progress on the issue because it is not serious enough and does not involve enough people.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing what the Minister says on this point. If it cannot be dealt with in an amendment to this Bill, he might give a commitment to consider it and return it for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the requests from Deputies Penrose and Se&aacute;n Ryan that the Minister consider this anomaly. It is unusual that the small group of people still receiving deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit, which is fading out, is exposed to several anomalies.</P>
      <P>Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, I was informed that the anomaly prohibiting people in receipt of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit being excluded from community employment schemes no longer existed. Will the Minister explain why these anomalies persist for this small group of people, which, according to the reply to my parliamentary question, is no more than 200, although Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan indicated that the figure is 300? What can the Minister do to ensure that the anomalies are put aside once and for all? As the Opposition has only limited room to manoeuvre in a Consolidation Bill and given that the original amendment has been ruled out of order, I appeal directly to the Minister to address this anomaly.</P><Col N="864"/>
      <P>I wish to make a further appeal regarding the consolidation process, which will apply to other areas of the Government&rsquo;s programme but, based on past trends, will probably not apply to social welfare legislation for another 11 or 12 years. We should consider how the consolidation process might fully involve Members. The changes that can be made in the process are limited and the committee appointed by the D&aacute;il, to which the Minister can add a specific number, consists only of Members of the two largest parties. In this instance, the Minister added one Member from the Government side and two Opposition spokespersons. That, however, excluded those of us in smaller parties, for example, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, Independent Members and the Progressive Democrats, should they choose to participate in social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>The consolidation process should be re-examined because being prohibited from participating in a Consolidation Bill on Committee Stage, and not being able to raise relevant issues at that point, limits one in terms of tabling amendments on Report Stage. It is an unsatisfactory situation and while the changes are technical, as were those discussed on Committee Stage, in order for the Members to be properly involved in the process it needs to be examined at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the latter point, I am aware that the consolidation procedure is very restrictive. It is laid down in Standing Orders and when I was asked to nominate three people, I did not have much scope and chose members of the two larger Opposition parties and one person from the Government side. It is no reflection on other Members. I would have been delighted to include other parties had I had the manoeuvring room to do so.</P>
      <P>I will discuss with colleagues whether there is scope to amend Standing Orders in the consolidation area. If the Deputy&rsquo;s party makes a formal submission on the subject, I will ensure that the Chief Whip and others examine it closely. There is no reason to exclude anybody who has something to offer from such a committee.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for raising the issue of the deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit anomaly. These policy changes, however, are not permitted in a Consolidation Bill. Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan has obviously studied the subject carefully. Two or three Deputies from my party raised this issue at recent parliamentary party meetings.</P>
      <P>At the end of August, 10,355 people were claiming deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit. Approximately 28% of those were awarded the payment on or after 31 August 1992. For good reasons at the time, the Social Welfare Act 1992 introduced an earnings limit on entitlements to the deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit. As a special measure no earnings limit operated for persons in receipt of this allow<Col N="865"/>ance whose claim was made after the end of August 1992.</P>
      <P>We abolished the deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit in 1997 and replaced it with the one-parent family allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did that not happen at an earlier date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, the scheme was closed off with effect from 2 January 1997. No new applications for the scheme were accepted after that date. Some people were stranded within the old scheme because they fell between the two earnings deadlines. This has been brought to my attention and in the past couple of hours my officials and I sat down to discuss this issue which needs to be resolved. We are considering the options for doing so. While it involves only a couple of hundred people, it can grow to involve thousands. The latter would make it a larger issue. Hopefully, we can deal with it now.</P>
      <P>I am examining closely how to resolve this during the process of preparing Estimates, budgets and the subsequent social welfare and pensions legislation. Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan made some specific suggestions about how to approach the problem but if he knows of a more specific way in which to deal with it, I am of a mind to act because it does not involve many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s positive response to that amendment and I will contact him or his officials. We will hopefully arrive at a point where people will see that the system looks at anomalies and endeavours to deal with them. I hope we can resolve this issue and I thank the Minister.</P>

We also welcome the commitment the Minister has made to produce for the public a user-friendly guide to the Bill. We look forward to getting that, as will constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies who gave consideration to the Bill on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and in the House today. I found the contributions very practical and we have come <Col N="867"/>away with some markers on what further progress we need to make. I thank Deputies for that. I also join them in thanking the officials and law officers for all their expertise. To borrow an Americanism, it is awesome to see the blood, sweat and tears that go into drafting a consolidation Bill of many measures, the last one being in 1993. One can only imagine the work that goes into it. It is here now and will be very useful to present and future legislators, and the public at large.</P>
      <P>I confirm that at the time of publication of the Act, we will produce a useful guide. I thank all involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Speaking as someone who can be pernickety with regard to amendments and so on, I thank the Minister for listening to us. We know he is circumscribed with regard to what he can do, but we often table amendments for the purpose of provoking debate on particular issues. In his Second Stage contribution, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan showed the importance of that. It is clear the Minister listened, which is also important. We recognise that and thank him. We also thank his officials for the help they have given us with many Bills.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not just for Deputies or lawyers, but also for the general public. Deputy Stanton is right regarding the explanatory guide. I know it will not purport to be a legal interpretation; that is always the safeguard of the Minister and others. Nevertheless, the guide will be useful. It will be the document many people will read to hopefully interpret some of their dues or entitlements.</P><Col N="868"/>
      <P>I also thank the legal staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and that of the Attorney General, who have contributed to the Bill. They have all done a very good job and served the consumers of social welfare in a solid manner with this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will now move on to amendment No. 7. Arising from Committee Stage proceedings, amendments Nos. 8, 9, 11 and 13 are related and amendment No. 10 is an alternative to amendment No. 9. Therefore, amendments Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, and amendment No. 13 will be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 12, line 38, to delete &ldquo;12&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;9&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage, it was signalled that consideration was being given to the overall composition of the council and that a substantive amendment to section 9 would be tabled on Report Stage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The health and social care professionals council will have a pivotal role in the system of statutory registration established under the Bill. Its object is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions. It will have responsibility for overseeing and co-ordinating the activities of the registration boards. It will also enforce standards of practice for registrants, including the codes of professional conduct and ethics adopted by registration board. Moreover, the council has responsibility for establishing committees of inquiry into com<Col N="870"/>plaints against registrants of the designated professions and for making decisions regarding the imposition of disciplinary sanctions on registrants.</P>
      <P>When providing for membership arrangements for the council, it is essential, therefore, to strike a good balance between professional expertise, knowledge of the health service and public interest so that the council is in the best position to fulfil its responsibilities. On this basis, and as indicated on Committee Stage, I have tabled amendment No. 11, which provides for the inclusion of three people among the council membership who have such qualifications, interests and experience which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be of value to the council in performing its functions.</P>
      <P>The overall number of members will not change, nor will the overall balance of practitioner and lay members. Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 are, therefore, technical amendments, consequent to amendment No. 11. Amendment No. 13 provides for the Minister to consult, as appropriate, in regard to appointments.</P>
      <P>Opposition amendments Nos. 8 and 9 suggest that the number of educational representatives on the council should be increased from one to two, with a corresponding reduction in the number of public interest representatives. The council does not have a primary interest in educational matters for the various professions, the responsibility for which lies with the relevant <Col N="871"/>registration boards. As part of the functions and powers of the council, it should encourage registration boards to collaborate with each other, including in the professional education and training of registrants. In light of this fact, I consider that the specific inclusion of one third level representative on the council is sufficient representation from that sector and the proposed Opposition amendments are, therefore, not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister of State has chosen to take the line he has and am surprised he feels that education has little or no role to play in the functions of the council because those who are involved in education and training feel very differently. This is particularly so, given the nature of the professions that are being defined, their responsibilities within the health and social care areas, the changes that occur in such responsibilities and the effect that has on education and training. It is important that there be a significant education component in the workings of this council.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 8 aims to ensure that a representative of the institutes of technology be considered for such a role on the council because it is not directly defined. On those grounds, I am seeking to change the allocations of educational representatives and general representatives from one and nine to two and eight, respectively. The Minister of State's amendments seek to change the number of general representatives to six, with three related to the area of employment. If the Minister of State thinks the employment area rates three times more highly than the education area, that reveals a significant flaw in the workings of the Bill as it progresses towards Final Stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to declare an interest in that my third level qualification in the social care area was achieved in the institute of technology sector. It was formerly called a child care qualification, which was achieved in the 1980s. It was a very loose use of terminology. It has since been changed to a degree in community care because in the 1980s formal qualifications for people working with community and youth sectors were not readily available in the Irish educational system. The institutes of technology, or the regional technical colleges as they were then, stepped into the breach to fill that gap. A significant expertise was developed in the institutes of technology in Cork, Athlone and Sligo, and they subsequently developed a competence in social care education in Waterford, Limerick and Dublin. It is now the pre-eminent provider of educational training for social care professionals. As we debate the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill, it is important to recognise that fact in the formation of the council. First, the educational component should be given due recognit<Col N="872"/>ion and, second, the importance of the institute of technology sector should be given proper weight in the formation and subsequent workings of the council.</P>
      <P>On these grounds, I hope the Minister of State will veer from his opening statement and accept that there is a need to give such recognition to a representative of the institutes of technology and to accept the spirit of what is being proposed, at least, in amendment No. 8. Amendment No. 10 is a technical amendment which depends on what the House decides in regard to the Minister&rsquo;s amendments relating to the nine general representatives and three subsequent representatives from the employment sector. Even at this stage, I ask the Minister to formally protect and acknowledge in the legislation the educational representative from the institute of technology sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Minister of State to elaborate on his proposal. I am concerned about the new paragraph <i>(c)</i> introduced in section 9, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">3 persons who have such qualifications, interests and experience as, in the opinion of the Minister, would be of value to the Council in performing its functions.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These are three positions that are being taken from paragraph (iv) of section 9, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">9 are representative of the interest of the general public and are appointed with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This infers the other six will not have such qualifications, interests or experience to be of value to the committee. Why draw such a distinction when the appointment of the nine representatives did not preclude the appointment of people representative of the interests of the general public who would have such qualifications, interests, experience or whatever, or any combination of or all three? What was intended was members of the public who will act in the interests of the general public and who would be considered as representative of that interest for service on the council. Why draw a distinction, and almost a hierarchy, in respect of three representatives over six representatives?</P>
      <P>I find the proposition very disagreeable. As the Minister of State is prepared to categorise three of the nine persons to be appointed as representative of the interests of the general public, how would he describe the other six persons? Would he describe them as people with no qualifications, no interests, no experience and, therefore, of no value to the council? The proposition is objectionable and opens a whole range of questions. I wonder has it been properly thought through.</P><Col N="873"/>
      <P>The proposals from my colleagues in the Green Party merit support because there is a kink towards one area of third level education, which is likely to be the predominant player. The colleges to which their amendment seeks to afford access are important and cover a range of areas, including bringing forward people who would have qualifications, interests and experience in the substantive areas addressed in the legislation. I agree with the Green Party amendments and I am deeply concerned about the approach adopted by the Minister and presented by the Minister of State. I hope he will give an account of the decision to proceed as outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Green Party&rsquo;s amendment which seeks to allow the educational institutions and people with training in the area to be represented on the council. Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I expect that all members of the council would have an interest, at least, experience and some knowledge of their role and value, and that the Minister would require some level of qualification, interest and experience in respect of the nominees to the council. For the Minister to say that just three people should have qualifications, interests and experience that would be of value to the council means that six need not have qualifications, interests or experience to be on the council. I am surprised the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is involved in such a proposal. I am surprised the Minister of State has proposed it here because of the implications for what Fianna F&aacute;il might do. I thought the Progressive Democrats would not accept such a suggestion because of the various appointments by their partners in the past to various bodies. I expected a higher level of ethical approach to such issues by the Progressive Democrats. While I may say this with some level of sarcasm, I am also raising a genuine query in this regard. The Minister of State will probably understand my concerns given that just three of the nine appointees will be required to have qualifications, interests and experience. It appears like Fianna F&aacute;il was going out of Government and they were making a whole lot of appointments before they leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Two issues arise from these amendments. The first relates to the issue identified by Deputy Boyle regarding the part to be played by the educational institutions and the educational sector generally. There is a problem in some professions in that the link between the professions, the professional bodies and the requirements of the professional bodies does not appear in some instances to match what is happening in the educational institutions. In recent times, particularly in the case of some professions &mdash; admittedly not the ones that are the subject of this Bill &mdash; the educational institutions appear to <Col N="874"/>be proceeding to teach undergraduate courses without knowing changes are taking place in the requirements of the professional bodies concerned. In some cases, students who are two or three years into a course find that the prescribed course does not match what the professional body will subsequently require. I am not sure whether the fault lies with the professional bodies changing the goalposts without regard to what is happening in the educational institutions or with the fact that those responsible for running the courses are not keeping up to speed with what is happening in the professional bodies but there is certainly a need for greater formal tick-tacking between professional bodies and educational institutions in regard to the courses. Therefore, the emphasis Deputy Boyle is proposing to put on the educational representation is well merited.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s amendment is one of those great curiosities. There will be three people who have such qualifications, interests and experience which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be of value to the council in performing its functions. This is rather like nominations for the Seanad. A person who likes food might be considered by the Minister to be suitable for the dietitian&rsquo;s board. This amendment is wide open. It is a prescription for the Government putting political activists, from whatever cumann is aggrieved about the fallout of the selection convention, on a State board. It is about the person who did not get the nomination at the selection convention. Anyone who is aggrieved by the outcome of such a convention will be fixed up by the Minister on a State board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>What about interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement of qualifications, interests and experience is wide enough in its own right but in the event there is any doubt, it is qualifications, interests and experience which, in the opinion of the Minister, would render them to be of value to the council in the performance of its functions. I have seen some formulas come before the House which are basically about giving the Minister a free hand to appoint every Tom, Dick and Harry for whatever reason on to State boards but this is the best I have ever seen. I am surprised the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is piloting this formula through the House. It has nothing to do with appointing people who are genuinely qualified, who have a contribution to make or who have some expertise to bring to bear on the work of the council. This is about appointing political activists on to the board and it is wide open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment involves appointing party hacks and cronyism. We have <Col N="875"/>had far too much of that in Irish political life. The public is rightly cynical about this type of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, stand up for the T&aacute;naiste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is departing the scene knowing quite well that what is being proposed here is the type of stunt we associate with other parties, perhaps the senior member in the coalition arrangement. His party has always professed itself to be above this type of action and it is actually engaging in it. That is regrettable and the Green Party will oppose the amendment. My colleague, Deputy Boyle, has outlined the reasons we wish to see people with real qualifications and particularly people from the institutes of technology becoming involved in the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies will be aware from a perusal of the legislation, the vast majority of appointments to this body will be made otherwise and on the direct say-so of the Minister. We are talking about three persons who have qualifications, interests and experience which will be of value to the council in performing its functions. The T&aacute;naiste is conscious of the fact that she has to have some accountability to the House in the public interest in regard to appointments to a body of this kind. I heard words such as &ldquo;cronyism&rdquo; used. They apply to all of us, to those who use the expressions as well as those to whom they are directed in the House. The T&aacute;naiste has political responsibilities under the Constitution &mdash; as has the House &mdash; and she is obliged to discharge them. It is not unreasonable, in legislation of this character, where there is substantial membership on the council, that the T&aacute;naiste should appoint three persons of whom she takes the view, in the public interest, have something to contribute.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, having replaced his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is probably not in a position to reply to the wider debate. However, he should accept that the proposal by the Government to reduce the nine general places to six and allow the Minister for Health and Children to directly appoint three people has everything to do with the initiation of the Bill, should it become an Act. It directly takes the nominating rights of nine people from the Minister for Education and Science and gives the Minister for Health and Children the right to make three of those nominations. If that does not constitute cronyism, I do not know what does. It is directly related to political personalities and <Col N="876"/>has nothing to do with the specific skills needed in the formation of the council and is unrelated to the general good of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State was not present to hear the opening contributions on the amendment tabled in my name and that of Deputy Gormley. The amendment relates to a specific competency that should be on the board, which should be weighted towards the third level sector. In addition, there should be proper recognition of the role played by the institutes of technology in the development of training, particularly in the social care professions. Perhaps the Minister of State will take this second opportunity to respond on that issue. These amendments are not seeking that the Opposition directly appoint members to the council or that individual political parties within the Opposition make such appointments. This is a specific reference as to how the Bill should work from its inception in regard to the educational sector and the training of social care professionals in particular. On the surface, it appears to be a reasoned amendment. I am disappointed that the Minister of State seems to have followed the indifference of his colleague in not responding to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that the appointment of the nine persons, both of the three proposed in amendment 11 and the six thereby remaining, as proposed in amendment No. 9, will be appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and not the Minister for Health and Children. Prior to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, coming before the House, I had asked his colleague, who has just left, to explain the criteria that will be used to appoint the other six members who will be representative of the interest of the general public as against the three who have the special designation, in the opinion of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as having such qualifications, interests and experience which would be of value to the council in performing in functions. Other colleagues and I on the Opposition benches have expressed our concerns in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am focusing on the inference that the other six would be people who would not have qualifications, interest or experience and who, in the opinion of the Minister, would be of limited or questionable value in service in the council. We should have left things as they stood in terms of the nine people, although I accept the Green Party amendment. I stated that we are drawing a hierarchy of three over six. A special determination is being made regarding three appointments and the remaining six will become lesser mortals. It would have been my view that any of the nine people representative of the interest of the general public would have one or more of the elements proposed in amendment No. 11, that is, <Col N="877"/>they would have qualifications or interests in or experience of the critical areas to be addressed by the council. Without exception, all of them would be viewed by the Minister, in this case the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, in making his or her appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on this point. They would all be people whose presence and involvement would be of value to the council in the service of the public interest. I await the further comments of the Minister of State on this questionable development on the original proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their queries and I am sorry that I was not in a position to address them in my reply. Deputy Boyle pointed out that the amendment seeks to increase the representation of the educational sector. The legislation as drafted proposes a representative of the third level educational establishments involved in the education of persons with respect to the practice of the designated profession. That person is nominated by the Minister for Education and Science. Provision exists in the legislation for representation by a third level educational establishment. Deputy Boyle seeks to increase this representation from one to two, one of whom must be representative of the institutes of technology. I believe that is the burden of his amendment.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for a representative from the educational institutions. In legislation of this type we must be careful not to have too many representatives from the educational institutions. Ultimately, these boards prescribe the standard that the institutions must follow. There is a danger in having too many representatives from the institutions that are, in effect, being accredited by the board, which gives rise to the possibility of a conflict of interest. We must be careful about extending that representation too far. I believe the Minister has struck a balance in securing the principle of representation.</P>
      <P>The questions raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in were more wide-ranging and philosophical in nature. He is suggesting that this legislation allows the Minister to exercise two very different types of discretion. He was trying to distinguish them and suggested that we might be better sticking with the original formula, which was that the Minister would appoint nine people representative of the general public with the consent of the <Col N="878"/>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, rather than subdividing the nine into six appointed in the public interest and three &ldquo;who have such qualifications, interests and experience as, in the opinion of the Minister, would be of value to the Council in performing its functions&rdquo;, as the T&aacute;naiste has put it in her amendment. It could be considered that the Minister is confusing the issue somewhat.</P>
      <P>The new provision introduced by the T&aacute;naiste encompasses a category which is arguably excluded under the existing provision, which is the category of public servants who might have considerable knowledge of these matters. The existing section states that the &ldquo;9 are representative of the interest of the general public&rdquo;. The view might be taken that the holding of a position as a public servant might be incompatible with representing the public interest. Specifically referring to qualifications, as the T&aacute;naiste does in her amendment, enables her or any future Minister to make an appointment to this board from within the public service. This is one consideration which weighed with her in arriving at this formula.</P>
      <P>I would not presume to give an authoritative interpretation as to how the T&aacute;naiste might exercise her discretion under the existing or proposed legislation. While I would not hazard a guess on the matter, the criteria are clearly laid down in the legislation. The essence of the original proposal relating to the nine appointments representative of the general public was that these would be consumer representatives. They are the representatives of the laity. The Minister was anxious to secure some expertise on the board which would still be external to the nominating processes which gives rise to the membership of the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to correct the record slightly. My confusion stemmed from the amendment being in the name of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. I was not reading from the Bill but from the amendment. I made reference to the Minister for Health and Children as being the nominating person when it is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My central point remains the same. The act of nomination is divided between two Departments. I would like the record to be corrected in this respect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>This time last year, Fine Gael used its Private Members&rsquo; time for much the same reason. I refer to the relentless upward curve in the number of road traffic accidents, the increase in the number of people killed, particularly young drivers and their passengers and the growth in the number of <Col N="884"/>serious accidents. We tend to pay less attention to the injuries than to the deaths, perhaps forgetting the life changing consequences such accidents have for the injured and their families. We all know the statistics of those killed and injured and we know the figures are not improving. October was a particularly grim month with almost twice as many killed as in the same month last year, 42 as opposed to 22. Tragically, many of these were young people. Ireland is the only EU country where the trend in road deaths is upwards instead of downwards.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have seen horrific television images of the aftermath of accidents and enough broken cars to be able to imagine all too clearly the broken bodies lifted from those cars. We have seen enough to empathise with the broken families who opened their doors to the worst news any family could get, the news we all dread, that some loved one is dead. Yet the inexorable rise in road deaths goes on &mdash; deaths that could have been avoided and accidents that could have been prevented. We can now predict each weekend with absolute certainty that the news bulletins will be characterised by the latest grim statistics. When the accidents are particularly bad, the victims young and the numbers involved more shocking and when the grief seems utterly unbearable we get promises of political action. All we ever seem to get are promises. It never seems to move beyond that. There is always another report pending, more legislation being prepared, always another excuse for why we have not come to grips with the real causes of accidents.</P>
        <P>Nothing we have to say will be news to the Minister. He can rightly say he has heard it all before. However, we make no apology for that. If repetition is what it takes, then we must be repetitive. As the Opposition it is our duty to highlight Government failures, to hold Ministers to account to the D&aacute;il and to the people. When lives are at stake, which is the case in the context of road safety, that duty is absolutely compelling and we cannot ignore it. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said recently that many Deputies say things they do not really believe. To avoid being accused of that I wish to say at the outset that I do not really believe Governments can put an end to people being killed on the roads.</P>
        <P>People not Governments drive cars and there is a significant element of personal responsibility involved. Parents also have a responsibility to instil in young drivers, especially those to whom they give their cars or for whom they buy cars, that it is simply not acceptable to speed, drink and drive, or take risks with their own lives and, especially, the lives of others. The relentless message to young people must be that a car is a potentially lethal weapon. If necessary, parents <Col N="885"/>must make themselves available at weekends to drive their children when they socialise, organise a non-drinking driver or pay for a taxi. I am conscious that it is more difficult for young people in rural areas to socialise but there must be a sense of mutual social responsibility from drivers, their families and passengers to ensure that no matter where people live they will change their driving habits and organise themselves so that they can travel and socialise without taking unnecessary risks. Even though the direct cause of most road accidents is due to driver behaviour, that behaviour can be and is influenced by Government action, or inaction.</P>
        <P>In all areas of our lives, rules, laws and regulations seek to influence what we do and how we behave. We have countless examples of how legislation has changed how we behave. The shame of being caught breaking the law, the fear of the legal consequences, the fines, the jail sentences and the withdrawal of privileges, such as driving licences, all operate as deterrents modifying our behaviour. As somebody said, fear works. Properly enforced legislation does much more than merely change our behaviour, it changes the entire culture of a society. The culture surrounding driver behaviour is an entirely negative one, informed by the attitude of apparent official indifference. Every aspect of official attitude, from legislation to enforcement to administration, sends a message of the low priority driver behaviour and, consequently, road safety has for Government. How can we be surprised if drivers pick up on this message and act accordingly? How can we be surprised when each Garda in the country arrests, on average, only one driver on suspicion of drink driving per annum? How can we be surprised when, as that figures implies, only one person for each of the 12,000 pubs in the country is arrested for drink driving in any year? Bizarrely and unforgivably, how is it that only one quarter of that 12,000 people are actually convicted?</P>
        <P>The priority accorded to road safety is measured by the resources allocated to it by the State. These figures speak for themselves and, consequently, over 30% of car drivers on main roads speed, drink driving is commonplace and the general driving standard is lamentable. Many people evidently feel they can do as they like on the roads, speed with impunity and drink with impunity. As far as driver behaviour is concerned, the message from Government is, anything goes. The chances of being detected are slim and of being convicted, even slimmer. Similarly to speeding offences, only 20% of the national road safety target is being reached. Heavily laden trucks with lethal potential speed with impunity, 85% on motorways, 60% on dual carriageways. With that level of non-compliance, one might as well not have a speed limit at all. It is simply ignored. The lack of a visible police presence is <Col N="886"/>creating the impression that drivers can break the law and get away with it. Worse than that, the message is that, not alone will one not be caught, as one is safe from detection, but that one is also safe from traffic accidents.</P>
        <P>The pre-election promise of 2,000 garda&iacute; was a deception with the first numbers only appearing three years later and the full complement, at best, not due to appear until 2008. An even greater deception is the much vaunted Garda traffic corps. It was announced with much fanfare this time last year. At that time, helicopters, motorbikes and luminous yellow jackets were much in evidence. Several months later we discovered that this year there would only be an increase of a miserable 33 garda&iacute; in the traffic unit. An even greater deception that only came to light recently is the fact that this is not a real traffic corps at all. It is not a dedicated corps, ring-fenced for traffic and road safety duties. At any time its members can be dealing with burglaries, filling in forms, signing passports or rescuing cats from trees. In fact, the traffic corps only comes into effect when its members don their yellow jackets. Once again, the public has been duped. Much was promised but little has been delivered.</P>
        <P>Penalty points, about which much has been said in the House, are another farce. They held the promise of having a dramatic effect on road deaths and initially this was the case. On 2 November, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, blamed the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda for delaying the expansion of the penalty points system. The previous week the Joint Committee on Transport was told by Assistant Commissioner, Eddie Rock, that the Garda had no difficulties handling the penalty points system. I have heard this message from the Garda for some time although, clearly, the opposite is the case. This indicates not only a lack of transparency but also a dismal failure of leadership in terms of delivery of road safety with no one willing to take responsibility.</P>
        <P>I would like to know what is the real story on penalty points. Nothing has changed or improved since the system was first introduced. In reply to a parliamentary question I was informed that the cost of installing the PULSE system was &euro;63 million. I do not know what it has cost since then in terms of maintenance and upkeep. Will it ever deliver on its promise? Until the system is fully and effectively functioning Garda time and energy is wasted and we will continue to have more road deaths.</P>
        <P>Random breath testing was promised by a previous Minister for Transport in 1999 but it has fallen completely off the radar. I accept there are concerns that the Garda would just use it to bump up the overall numbers of people tested and that there are also civil liberties concerns. However, we cannot just walk away from it because so many of the cases brought to court are failing <Col N="887"/>simply because the Garda must prove that tests were not random and that they had cause to stop people. It is time to prepare legislation and have the Supreme Court test it. Safeguards can be included in regard to civil liberties and other concerns which people have.</P>
        <P>If penalty points are a farce, speed cameras are high farce. Fixed speed cameras currently only exist in counties Dublin, Meath, and Louth. A total of 20 fixed camera boxes exist but there are only three cameras. Speed cameras were initially rolled out as a pilot project, with the aim being to roll out such cameras nationally. The three mobile cameras are rotated between the 20 boxes. After almost three years, there are no additional cameras outside these areas. A reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform tabled by me revealed that of the 20 boxes, nine, or almost 50%, were damaged. Nobody ever thought of repairing them &mdash; it took up to eight months to repair them. In essence, we have a very restrictive speed camera system confined to a couple of counties.</P>
        <P>After lengthy consultation, many reports, published on the website, press statements and so on, and with much fanfare, it was announced that the speed camera system would be outsourced. The Minister decided he could not manage it and decided to give it to someone else to manage. Outsourcing was promised which would solve everything in that there would be increased efficiency and output. More legislation was promised to facilitate that. Both those promises are up some cul-de-sac. There has been no output as a result of those promises. There has been research, reports and promises about outsourcing but zero outcome. Surely the Minister has not been so caught up with preparing his one page plan for transport that he could not achieve anything in the area of road safety.</P>
        <P>Driver testing is a crucial area because it is where young people first interface with the rules of the road and where they form the attitudes and practices which they will probably carry throughout their lives and which will influence their behaviour in the future. This area is a complete mess and I do not believe anyone in government could say otherwise. Over half of all drivers fail their first driving test. This is either due to poor instruction or poor driving, or both, or poor testing. The Government must introduce some regulation of the driver instruction process. Anyone can set up a driving school. One does not even need a driving licence, which is absolutely incredible. Regulation and certification are needed.</P>
        <P>One in six drivers on Irish roads have not passed a full driving test. The number of drivers holding provisional licences is partly due to the fact that 43% of them have failed their test. Even when they are retested, the failure is almost as <Col N="888"/>high. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system which allows drivers who continually fail their test to go back on the road armed with nothing other than a certificate of incompetence to drive, yet they are let out year in, year out. It is sending a message that the Government does not care and that people do not have to be careful and do not even have to make an effort to pass the test. That must change. Nobody can stand over such a system.</P>
        <P>Legislation to delegate responsibility in this area was introduced in the House some months ago. The content of the legislation showed a lamentable paucity of ideas as to how this problem should be solved but at least a new authority was to be set up. The Minister expressed the hope that this would change everything, but the legislation has disappeared. The Minister said he will reintroduce it beefed up but there is no sign of it. People are still dying on the roads and we have no idea what will happen.</P>
        <P>There are countless other issues to be addressed. For instance, an issue which is emerging is the impact of drug misuse on driver behaviour and this is a major cause of death. There is no roadside testing system. Clearly, any road safety programme or campaign must take into account that this may be a significant cause of road traffic accidents.</P>
        <P>Of course, other issues have raised their heads in the context of the appalling accident in County Meath, such as the role the road surface plays in accidents. That must be addressed. It must be made absolutely clear to local authorities that they must enforce whatever guidelines are there because it is unacceptable that roads are left in a condition which is not safe, particularly when local authorities are responsible for rendering them unsafe. When road works are going on, particularly on lonely country roads, they must be clearly marked so that everyone is fully aware the road surface is not considered safe.</P>
        <P>Another issue about which I feel strongly was raised by the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, or perhaps the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resource, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that is, mobile telephone use. Originally, the use of a hand-held mobile telephone while driving was to be a penalty point offence but the Minister did not know how to define a mobile telephone, so he had to withdraw that proposal. It is extraordinary that it can be defined in every other country in the world. This is an issue to which we must return.</P>
        <P>To include such an offence under the penalty point offence of dangerous driving is simply not good enough and it is not working. In single car accidents involving young people, the use of a hand-held mobile telephone while driving may well be a cause. We must create a culture where it is not acceptable to drive a car while using a hand-held mobile telephone. Indeed, I have seen <Col N="889"/>truck drivers do three-point turns with mobile telephones held to their ears. It is an unsafe practice and we must make it clear that it is not acceptable. People think it is perfectly legal and they use mobile telephones while driving all the time and make no attempt to hide the fact that they do so. An attempt to legislate must be made to at least reduce their use. I understand there may be problems with enforcement but we could reduce their use and the likelihood of such accidents.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is responsible for traffic. Road safety is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and only he can act to make a difference. Even best practice will not secure zero deaths but, according to the National Safety Council, it would save 140 lives per year and save 1,200 people from crippling injury. It is up to the Minister whether he saves those lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We face an emergency in regard to road deaths and serious injury on our roads. The figures are startling. Last year there were 374 road deaths and over 3,000 serious injuries. It is clear these figures will be exceeded this year as predictions are for approximately 380 roads deaths and over 3,000 serious injuries. When one looks at what happens in the United States, for example, when they expect a hurricane or a tornado they make efforts to reduce the number of people who will die as a consequence, but one wonders what we are doing to reduce what we know will happen by way of carnage on our roads. Given that we know that this year 380 people will be killed on our roads and 3,000 people will be seriously injured, what are we doing about it? It is clear that many of those deaths are preventable and many of those serious injuries should not happen.</P>
        <P>I am not into the types of foolish stakes of a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he spoke about zero tolerance and pretended it would lead to zero crime. I have heard recognised experts and have looked at the various reports, and indeed, the figures produced by the chairman of the National Safety Council who said that with best practice, we should be talking about six deaths per 100,000. That would give a figure of 240 deaths per annum. That figure is comparable internationally. Why are we not talking about saving lives and about taking those preventative measures to achieve best practice outcomes? By not doing so, we are all responsible for the deaths of at least 100 people and for the fact that at least 1,000 people will be seriously injured on our roads this year alone.</P>
        <P>While, of course, I point the finger at the Government, which can take measures, I accept there is a responsibility on us all to push for changes to legislation, for measures to be taken as regards enforcement, for the necessary invest<Col N="890"/>ment in this area and for insisting that at all times this issue should be a number one priority. If the hurricane or tornado predicted by Brendan McWilliams in <i>The Irish Times</i> was to happen, we would take measures to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries, but we are not doing so in regard to road deaths. It is obvious what we should do. One does not have to reinvent the wheel in this regard. The prescription is in the Government&rsquo;s own road strategy. It admits there should be a targeted reduction in the number of road deaths to 300 per annum. All the measures have been set out in detail but the problem is they have not been implemented. Why not?</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, has covered the broad issue and I do not intend to plough the same ground. I will, therefore, refer to a number of issues such as speeding. Everybody accepts speed is a major problem in the context of road traffic accidents. Why has it not been dealt with? Why are there only three fixed speed cameras in the State, which is ridiculous? Why is the rate of enforcement of road traffic legislation only a fraction of that in other countries? Why has the Government not provided the equipment or the personnel? Is the money not available to make such provision? Why is this investment not made?</P>
        <P>We also need to examine how best to make such provision. The privatisation of the operation of speed cameras, thereby improving enforcement, should be considered so that the Garda can deal with serious crime. A dedicated company should be involved in speed detection. The State has had bad experiences in the privatisation of road traffic functions, particularly clamping. I recall a number of incidents in Galway where the clampers were an absolute disgrace. However, with proper control, a privatised system could be introduced which would achieve results.</P>
        <P>The key factor in speed detection is to discourage people from breaking the law. It should be aimed at reducing road accidents. There is no point in enforcing speed limits by setting up checkpoints to spear fish in a barrel to generate revenue or pursue detections in areas where there is no serious risk of an accident. It must be ensured blackspots and black times such as weekends are targeted. If the system were privatised, a bonus could be paid to those involved on the basis of the reduction in road deaths as opposed to speeding detections. That could be the benchmark against which the employees could be judged for a bonus.</P>
        <P>A new approach to the detection of speeding and drink driving and the enforcement of speed limits is needed. The drink driving laws are largely ignored and not enforced, with an occasional push at Christmas and other times. Attitudes must change but, above all, stronger enforcement is needed. The Garda must be involved but the force&rsquo;s numbers are not large <Col N="891"/>enough. Earlier in a radio interview, it was stated the thin blue line is getting thinner in many areas and has disappeared in some parts of the State. Issues such as random breath sampling must be examined. Promises have been made in this regard and, while it presents difficulties, they should be teased out. The difficulties have been resolved in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand. For example, sobriety checkpoints have been introduced in a number of states in America to get over the difficulties. The Government should do something in this regard. Its road strategy lists legislative measures which look grand in print but that is where they remain.</P>
        <P>My colleagues are as seriously concerned about this issue as I am. The prescription is available regarding what should be done legislatively and through enforcement. Investment needs to be made and the money is available. Why in the name of goodness does the Government not follow the prescription? Why is this issue not a priority on its agenda? Until it is a priority, many people will be needlessly killed or seriously injured on our roads. The time for action is now and that is what we, in Fine Gael, demand of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. I am hugely frustrated by the Government&rsquo;s failure to take practical and measurable steps to respond to the increasing number of road fatalities and to road safety generally. Ireland compares dismally with other EU member states regarding annual road deaths per head of population and it is the only country in the EU in which the number of road fatalities is increasing annually. A total of 323 people have been killed on our roads in the first ten months of the year, almost twice the population of the House. This is higher than for the corresponding period last year. Many of these accidents are avoidable and involve single vehicles while most are caused by driver error or poor road conditions.</P>
        <P>People dying on our roads should not be an issue for political points scoring or division. I hope the Minister of State can tell from the tone of the debate that the issue is not being used by Fine Gael to score points. The House should support strong and prioritised policies to tackle the cause of so much tragedy on our roads. The Government and local authorities have done bits and pieces to handle the issue but the evidence is clear that the trend is headed in the wrong direction and policies are failing. The Government&rsquo;s primary target in its road safety strategy was a 25% reduction in road deaths so that there would be fewer than 300 deaths a year. However, we are nowhere near that and we are moving in the opposite direction.</P><Col N="892"/>
        <P>The two most important issues are enforcement and improvement in driver behaviour. With regard to enforcement, the penalty points concept was good. It was supported by the Opposition when it was introduced and it was taken seriously by the public. It had a dramatic effect on the roads. Many Members spend a great deal of time on the road and there was a noticeable reduction in speeding in the six months following the introduction of the penalty points system. However, since then people have not taken penalty points seriously as an enforcement measure because they are not caught often enough. When they are caught, they do not receive notices of penalty points in the post. Sometimes the notices arrive three months are the incident, which does not allow an accused to challenge the offence. The system is not being taken seriously and people are dying as a result.</P>
        <P>Three fixed speed cameras are in place throughout the State. I do not care whether the Government or a private company invests in and provides a network of speed cameras. My preference is that a private firm should create a network and deal with enforcement efficiently while being carefully monitored. The Government should get such a network up and running, whoever administrates it. There are no fixed speed cameras between Cork and Dublin, the two main cities in Ireland, even though the majority of this route is dual carriageway. There are no speed cameras between Cork and Limerick or between Galway and Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a camera in Lucan, County Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It will only work if the box contains a camera. The Garda traffic corps has undermined the Government&rsquo;s credibility regarding how seriously it is taking road fatalities. The corps comprises 23 garda&iacute; who are not on traffic duty full-time. This Minister of State shakes his head as if this is not true but I am using his figures.</P>
        <P>I refer to drink driving. Why is addressing drink driving prioritised at Christmas and on other key weekends during the year but not on other weekends? Why do we not take drug driving seriously? Road safety and road deaths are not a priority for this Government. Some 400 people will die on the roads in Ireland this year. The response we receive in every area can be undermined. This is not simply a matter of enforcement. It concerns teaching young people how to drive as part of their education.</P>
        <P>Unlike other speakers, I do not think it is sufficient to implement the road safety strategy that was published. We should examine models used to great success in other countries, particularly in driver training. As part of their education, people go to driving school for two or <Col N="893"/>three weeks in France, Canada and the United States. If we are serious about teaching young people how to drive responsibly and correctly, to understand cars and their dangers and the importance of seat belts, we should teach them how to drive properly. We can send people to a driving school or have them undertake a structured driving course, involving continuous assessment and requiring the passing of various tests before being allowed to drive. We should abolish the system whereby those who fail the driving test are still allowed to drive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Mitchell for proposing this motion. Many people in the country will follow this debate with interest. We are not winning the battle on road safety. I listened with great interest to Mr. Eddie Shaw of the National Safety Council when he addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport last week. His comments on how road safety matters are handled, managed and executed were scathing. His premise was that no strategic planning exists, as many of my colleagues have stated. No cohesion exists between stakeholders and no targets have been set to measure achievements. Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s comments described the problems of the system and many of my colleagues have referred to this. I assume the Minister of State agrees with the description and if this is the case, there is a need for much quick thinking and faster action.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Minister for Transport when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport last week. As any Minister would, he proceeded to outline the great achievements of the Government and some minor achievements can be identified. He did not mention Ireland&rsquo;s pathetic record within the EU. Fatalities on our roads increased by 13% at a time when every other country in the EU had an average decrease of 7%. How can this be described as progress? The Minister did not tell us that the Garda budget for technical aspects of the job was more in 2000 than it was in 2004. The budget decreased by approximately &euro;200,000 in that period and these figures have been provided in response to parliamentary questions.</P>
        <P>The introduction of penalty points was positive but the public caught on. People realised the chances of being caught were slim or non-existent. If the Government is not able to enforce a law, the consequences are clear. What happened to 2,000 extra garda&iacute; promised by various Ministers and the Taoiseach? They will not be in the force for several years and all the Government speaks of is further legislation.</P>
        <P>Minor roads, to which a speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour applies, resemble Mondello Park. No speed detection exists on these roads, which have become the new highways. I agree with my colleagues that driver testing is the greatest joke of all time.</P>

	<P>I am relieved to have this opportunity to speak on this important motion. Watching the news, particularly at weekends, I am shocked by the considerable loss of life that occurs on our roads. As a country, we are failing to address the root causes of road accidents. That the number of fatalities increases every year is evidence of a major failure of the administration. More than 5,000 have died on Irish roads in the past decade, a significant number by any comparison.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To address a complex matter such as road deaths requires a multi-pronged strategy. The first issue to be addressed is the number of garda&iacute; dedicated to the traffic corps. This must be allocated its full complement of staff immediately. In conversation, one will often hear a comment on the likelihood of getting caught driving slightly over the speed limit in zones of 50 miles per hour or 60 miles per hour. People should uphold the law but human nature sometimes goes against this. People need incentives to uphold the law and they must know that if they drink and drive, break the speed limit or rob a bank they will not escape punishment. This is the kernel of the problem.</P>
        <P>I drive to Dublin most weeks, as many people do, and I am struck by the farcical state of the Dublin-Cork road. Part of the road is a dual carriageway, elsewhere there are single lane stretches where the speed limit is routinely broken. Approaching Dublin, traffic grinds to a halt first because of roadworks, then because of a never-ending rush hour. It is no wonder people are tempted to break speed limits when they reach a stretch of good road. The frustration they encounter on the road makes the journey extremely difficult for drivers. For this reason, speed cameras must be located at frequent intervals along this road. The purpose of these cameras must not be to catch people out but to warn them.</P>
        <P>Other speakers referred to minor roads, a source of significant problems in this country. Local authorities have not addressed the problem of overgrowing hedges in the summertime that cause accidents on minor roads. In autumn, falling leaves make roads treacherous and local authorities make no effort to clean up such roads. An ever-increasing number of accidents occur on these roads.</P>
        <P>While there are many issues to be addressed, an important one is the education of young people. People are driving a mechanically propelled vehicle, which can be extremely dangerous. The transition year in schools is an ideal opportunity for people to learn to handle mechanically propelled vehicles. Deputies from all sides of the House agree with this, yet nothing is done about it. I ask the Minister of State to consider transition year as an opportunity to educate younger people on this issue.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">As someone who made a living driving along the highways and by-ways of this country, I have a fair understanding of road safety issues. Equally, as a parent with two children at home who are licensed to drive, I am conscious of much that has been said concerning the tragedy of fatal road accidents involving young people. Deputy <Col N="896"/>Cassidy and I listened intently to the accurate information that has arisen during the debate. We share the Opposition&rsquo;s view and dearly wish to see a reduction in the number of road accidents causing death and serious injury. I do not think there is anybody in the House who would not share that view.</P>
        <P>Long before I assumed my current portfolio at the Department of Transport, the record shows that I pursued some of the issues that were raised this evening, including road safety education in transition year, speed cameras and driver theory testing. The latter test is applied before granting a driving licence. It is frustrating that some people are not allowed to drive on motorways even though most routes are now motorways. On the other hand, when people pass the driving test they are expected to drive on motorways in the same way as an experienced driver. Such people have driving licences allowing them to drive on a motorway without any additional training.</P>

	<P>The presentation of the subject of road safety for discussion today and tomorrow allows me an opportunity to outline the progress the Government and other agencies engaged in road safety are making in pursuing our plans on an ongoing basis.</P><Col N="897"/>
        <P>The current rate of road deaths provides the general background to the motion tabled by Fine Gael. It looks in particular at the number of road deaths in October. I have no intention of minimising the concern society rightly has when it witnesses the deaths of 43 people over a period of one month. That concern is shared by the Government.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing that the rate of progress achieved in reducing road deaths in 2003 has not been maintained or improved upon. However, I express some caution in looking at data relating to road deaths over short time periods. Dependence on the consideration of data over short periods, such as monthly totals, masks the fact that such data can be influenced by particular tragedies that result in multiple deaths and injuries. Of far greater relevance is the establishment of trends that are sustained over relatively long periods. Provisional data for this year reveals wide variations on a month-to-month basis. Road deaths in October were at a level that was nearly double that of the previous year. However, it is a fact that in other months this year the numbers of fatalities were significantly lower than those experienced for the same months in previous years.</P>
        <P>Looking at data for the years since the introduction of the first road safety strategy, it is clear that there has been a measurable decrease in road deaths compared with preceding years. The Government will not be complacent, however, by suggesting that we are content with the situation. We are not and our aim is to see that major reductions in the current levels of road deaths are sustained over the long term.</P>
        <P>Road safety is a multidimensional area of public policy. It engages a range of Government and other agencies which must work together to achieve concrete, lasting results. That is why in 1997 the Government adopted the national road safety strategy. This represented the first time road safety planning and initiatives were placed within a distinct policy framework. That framework featured a set of specific goals based on the delivery of progress across a range of areas. Previously, road safety policy had been fragmented and initiatives were pursued on a singular basis.</P>
        <P>The adoption of a more strategic approach was pursued, in the first instance, against the realisation that the persistent growth in vehicle numbers and negative trends in road casualties required a concerted and integrated response. An immediate focus of the consideration of the response was the realisation that, internationally, those states where the greatest level of success had been achieved in reducing road casualties on a sustained basis, had adopted strategies that were planned nationally and pursued against a background of the realisation of specific targets.</P>
        <P>It is likely that if we had not adopted a similar approach we would have seen the maintenance <Col N="898"/>of the level of casualties that had been prevalent through the 1990s. In the period between 1990 and 1997 the average annual number of road deaths was 442. This compares with an annual average of 400 since the adoption of the first road safety strategy. In the past three years, the average number of road deaths was 362.</P>
        <P>Given the focus of the motion from Fine Gael, it would be appropriate to reflect briefly on the delivery on the commitments made over the past eight years within the framework of the first strategy.</P>
        <P>In the area of drink driving alone we have seen the delivery of a range of major initiatives. In 1999, the roll-out of evidential breath testing was completed. Through the Road Traffic Acts 2002 and 2003, the circumstances by which a driver can be required to undergo a preliminary roadside breath test were extended. In addition to the situation where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forms the opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol, any driver who has been involved in a collision or who may have committed a traffic offence may be required to submit to a roadside breath test.</P>
        <P>The 2002 Act also featured the first comprehensive review of monetary penalties for road traffic offences since 1984. A major feature of the 2002 Act was the introduction of the penalty points and fixed charge systems. The initial effect of the application of penalty points to speeding offences was a dramatic reduction in the rate of road deaths. While the scale of reductions realised in the months immediately following the introduction of the system has not been maintained, the number of road deaths annually over the past three years is significantly lower than the levels recorded in preceding years. It is clear that the system has made a positive contribution to road safety since its introduction.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 also presents commitments to pursue major policy initiatives across a number of key road safety areas and progress is being made in the metrication of speed limits, the establishment of a Garda traffic corps, the further roll-out of penalty points, the engagement of private sector interests in the operation of speed cameras and the pursuit of an appropriate form of random breath testing for drink driving</P>
        <P>It is accepted that excessive speed is both a primary reason for many road collisions and a major contributing factor in determining the degree to which the collision gives rise to casualties. A review of our speed limit structure against the background of the adoption of metric values was targeted as one of the central legislative initiatives to be pursued as part of the strategy.</P>
        <P>The process that underpinned the adoption of the new metric speed limit system was supported by the passage of the necessary legislation in December 2004, which was followed by the pro<Col N="899"/>vision of some 58,000 signs showing the new speed limit values. The latter exercise was completed by local authority personnel over a short period leading up to 20 January, when the new system took effect. Not only did this system see the adoption of metric speed limit values, it also saw a reduction of 16 km/h in the speed limit applying to the rural regional and local roads.</P>
        <P>The new legislation confirmed the central role of the elected members of county and city councils in making determinations for changes to the speed limits applied under the legislation and gave them the capacity to deploy a greater range of speed limit values, including the 30 km/h speed limit. The legislation also allowed for public engagement with local authorities making speed limit changes.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the dedicated traffic corps last year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a distinct management structure under the command of an assistant commissioner addresses a particular commitment given by the Government. The Minister has achieved his commitment to increase the strength of the corps to 563 members by the end of 2005. When fully staffed, the corps will make significant gains in road safety through consistent high levels of traffic law enforcement. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has in recent weeks reiterated his commitment to rolling out the traffic corps and announced the deployment of additional Garda resources to Donegal given the number of tragic collisions in that region in recent months. By the end of 2008, traffic corps strength will more than double to 1,200 garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the dedicated traffic corps will not impact on the capacity of all other members of the Garda to address road safety issues and pursue those who breach traffic laws. However, the growing presence on our roads of a dedicated highly visible corps of officers will be a greater deterrent to the type of behaviour that leads to road collisions.</P>
        <P>One of the key policy initiatives proposed in the original road safety strategy was the introduction of the penalty points system. The system was applied to speeding offences in 2002 and has subsequently been rolled out to the key offences of not using a seat belt, driving without insurance and careless driving. The significant downturn in road deaths recorded in late 2002 and into 2003 reflects a reaction to the deterrent effect of the penalty points system. That effect has dissipated somewhat since then. I share the frustration of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, that we are not yet in a position to extend the application of penalty points. However, we intend to extend penalty points to a range of additional road safety related offences as part of the next phase of the system&rsquo;s overall roll-out as quickly as possible. This extension will depend <Col N="900"/>upon and be supported by the application of the necessary information technology support framework which is being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda.</P>
        <P>The road safety strategy commits the Government to engage private sector interests to deploy and operate speed cameras. A working group, established to examine the general framework for this proposal, acknowledged that it will be necessary to engage private sector interests if we are to reach the critical mass required to meet the enforcement targets for speeding offences in the road safety strategy. Legislation will soon be brought forward to provide an appropriate statutory basis for the pursuit of this proposal, initially through the development of an appropriate tendering process which will be informed by the key recommendations set out in the report of the working group.</P>
        <P>The report of the working group, which will inform our pursuit of this initiative, presents a template for its operation grounded in road safety. The Garda will have a general supervisory role in the management of the initiative and, with the assistance of the National Roads Authority, will be responsible for choosing sites for the placement of cameras. Sites will be selected by direct reference to collision history and prevalence of speeding incidents. The group has recommended that there be no connection between revenue collected from detections by privately operated cameras and the funding of the operation.</P>
        <P>The road safety strategy provides that random breath testing should be in place before the end of 2006. This is seen as a particularly successful element of road safety policy in many states. In pursuit of the commitment given in the road safety strategy, my Department has engaged in a detailed examination of the possible approaches that could be adopted in this country to give the Garda greater powers to impose roadside breath tests. This has been informed and supported by the receipt of independent legal opinion and the opinion of the Attorney General. Our policy in this area must be pursued in the knowledge that significant legal challenges have been presented to the current drink driving laws. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has invited the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and the transport spokespersons of the political parties to meet him next week to discuss the adoption of a policy in this area that will command cross-party support.</P>
        <P>The process of establishing the road safety authority is well advanced. Its legislative basis is the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 which has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. The principal purpose of the Bill is to establish a driver testing and standards authority whose primary responsibility will be the delivery <Col N="901"/>of the driver testing service and the regulation of driving instructors. The authority will also have a statutory duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards.</P>
        <P>During the Second Stage debate the Minister indicated that establishing a separate public sector body to deliver the driver testing service and take responsibility for other functions connected with the testing and control of drivers provided an opportunity to assign other general road safety functions to that authority. As a consequence, the Government decided to amend the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 to enable it to assign other functions to the authority. This will ensure that the authority can play an important role in improving road safety in general. In view of these amendments, it is proposed to change the title of the driver testing and standards authority to the road safety authority and that of the Bill to the road safety authority Bill.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The road safety authority will be a single agency with responsibility for a wide range of functions which have a bearing on road safety and will be in a unique position to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda through delivery of road safety programmes such as the testing of drivers and vehicles, driver education and the promotion of awareness of road safety in general. The authority will play a significant advisory role to the Minister in the development of road safety policy.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the road safety authority, the road safety functions of the National Safety Council will be transferred to it.</P>
        <P>As the Bill already provides that the authority will have a general duty to &ldquo;promote the development and improvement of driving standards&rdquo; it is appropriate that the educational brief of the NSC, together with its brief for the promotion of road safety, be transferred to the authority.</P>
        <P>In the road haulage sector the authority will take responsibility for the functions currently exercised by my Department regarding driver hours and rest periods, including the tachograph, the working time directive for mobile workers in the road transport sector and the implementation of EU requirements regarding bus and lorry driver vocational training. In addition, the authority will also be enabled to enforce the relevant regulations in these areas as well as the conditions applying to licensed road haulage operators. Responsibility for implementing new requirements under EU directives on professional driver training in this area will also be assigned to the new authority.</P>
        <P>While the Bill already provides for vehicle testing to be transferred to the authority, it is proposed to also transfer other functions relating to the standards that apply to vehicles sold or used in Ireland, as required by EU directives, and all related matters. Work in this area includes EU <Col N="902"/>vehicle type approval law, standards for in-service vehicles, commercial vehicle testing and oversight of the NCT.</P>
        <P>Major improvements in Irish road safety have taken place over the past 30 years. The annual road death toll had reached into the 600s during the 1970s, whereas between the early 1990s and 2001, it stood in the 400s. Since 2002, the highest annual number of road deaths experienced was 376. This significant improvement has been achieved in the face of increasing traffic volumes and road travel.</P>
        <P>A range of factors has contributed to the delivery of this improvement. It is no coincidence that the improvements have coincided with the adoption of a strategic approach to road safety policy through the implementation of road safety strategies. However, the Government is not satisfied with the current situation. We recognise that the achievement of the overall target in the road safety strategy is a major challenge. We are fully committed to meeting that challenge and to continue to advance road safety in a concerted and co-ordinated manner. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>For most of my life I have been travelling 60,000 miles annually all over Ireland, on inferior roads for much of the time. Most Members of the Oireachtas probably travel more than 40,000 miles annually.</P>
        <P>It is every parent&rsquo;s worst fear at weekends when their sons or daughters go out for an evening that they might not come home safely. Unfortunately we occasionally see the most horrific tragedies and accidents on our roads. These accidents involve not only young people, but many others.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am the chairperson, have examined this issue with regard to the insurance inquiry. I agree with Deputy Coveney that road safety should be on the school curriculum in terms of the importance of good driving. Students should be assisted before they leave school, by whatever means the Government can offer, in order to alert them to the important issues and to the responsibility which anyone who turns a key in a car ignition and drives a car has to fellow citizens and to those travelling in the car.</P>
        <P>In the course of our investigation for the insurance inquiry we visited New York, where we spent two and a half days with the New York police. We learned much about their techniques and methods. Regarding insurance, we noted that every police person in New York has a hand-held computer. Put to the window of a car, this shows whether insurance and all else is in order, and indicates if the person driving the car is of good character or has previous convictions. It provides a sort of character reference for the police. The police traffic corps is wholly responsible for <Col N="903"/>traffic in the state of New York and would not agree that their work should under any circumstances be hired out to the public sector.</P>
        <P>I note Deputy Howlin has arrived. He is a very valuable member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.</P>
        <P>To our surprise, we also found in New York that with the traffic corps in action 24 hours per day, crime fell by one third in New York state, because a criminal has to get from A to B.</P>

That country has in place the computer which has been successful in everything to do with penalty points, the issuing of summonses and so on. No trial is necessary and there is no excessive cost to the Exchequer. The computer machinery is in place in New Zealand. I accept Eddie Shaw&rsquo;s advice that this instrument could reduce road deaths by 50%.</P>

        <P>Deputy Coveney is right to say road safety should not be a party political issue. I hope we all agree on that. Road safety is a serious issue and I hope we can help the Minister in that area.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe made a point about soft targets. One has to be very careful in that area. I recall making a similar speech when I was cathaoirleach of Dublin County Council six years ago, and being given a lecture by the road safety people. The perception exists in terms of speeding that there are soft targets. Some weeks ago, I attended a Fianna F&aacute;il meeting in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght, where it was noted that areas such as the Belgard Road are regarded as soft targets. Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe is correct in that respect.</P>
        <P>I have visited a number of schools in south-west Dublin. At a girls&rsquo; school in Greenhills, I <Col N="905"/>had an opportunity to actively support the road safety week it had introduced. I commend such initiatives and look forward to voting for the Government&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Much is revealed about the carnage on our roads by the fact that the figures included in this motion when Fine Gael issued notice of it last Friday are already out of date. Sadly, the numbers of fatalities on our roads are increasing daily and currently stand at 328 this year.</P>
        <P>This exercise is not about apportioning blame but should be about taking responsibility for a problem that has robbed us of 2,239 lives in the past six years. The Government is not to blame for these deaths. There are any number of causes for serious accidents, including driver behaviour and error, vehicle standards and driving conditions. However, the Government is charged with addressing these causes and it is time it is held to account for its failure to do so.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for road safety and, in particular, the implementation of the road safety strategy stretches across the Departments of Transport, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Health and Children, yet there is little evidence that the issue is being taken seriously by the four relevant Ministers. It is disappointing that none of those senior Ministers bothered to attend tonight&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>The truth is that there is a lethargy at the heart of Government, where road safety is quite often seen as someone else&rsquo;s problem, reform happens whenever there is time to get around to it and the issue is pushed to the back of the political and legislative agenda. We are 13 months into the current road safety strategy, which has a further 13 months left to run. In the absence of an annual review, I have been examining how each target is being met. While there have been some welcome initiatives and I welcome in particular the establishment of a Garda traffic corps, although delays are being experienced in bringing that to its full complement, by and large the strategy is behind schedule. I have identified at least 20 road safety measures which the Government has yet to implement or for which there are no obvious dates for completion. Of course, the Government will say that 13 months remain before they must provide many of these items but the fact that many proposals are not even listed in the Government&rsquo;s indicative legislative programme suggests they will not be met.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>With regard to drink driving, no legislation has been introduced for random breath testing, despite the promises made some years ago by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and other undertakings made at the commencement of the road safety strategy to introduce measures. The current Minister for Transport cites constitutional difficulties with this measure.</P>
        <P>Equally, there has been no increase in the charges applying under section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. This section provides for a charge to be applied against convicted drink drivers as a deterrent and to meet the cost of investigating their offences. Currently the fine stands at a mere &euro;95 and, while it was to be increased to &euro;250 under the current road safety strategy, the amount has not changed since the commencement of the Act.</P>
        <P>The expansion of the penalty points system has been stalled by the failure to put in place the necessary information technology. The latest news is that the system may be ready in April but it is becoming more difficult to believe the Government&rsquo;s target dates. More than three years after the introduction of penalty points, only five of the 69 promised offences are included.</P>
        <P>There appears to be little or no progress on the mutual recognition of penalty points between the South and the North and Great Britain. Drivers on both sides of the border can drive with impunity as far as penalty points are concerned. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, need only travel along the M1 to see many cars with yellow registration plates driving at speed south of the Border. This is the most glaring example of putting matters on the long finger I have seen for some years and it amounts to political negligence.</P>
        <P>In terms of enforcement, no legislation has been published on the control of mobile phone use by drivers, despite many promises. There has yet to be a response to EU Directive 2003/20/EC, which requires that seatbelts be worn in vehicles in which they are fitted, including school buses. The EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications has not been implemented nor, as was suggested in the strategy, has a bilateral agreement been entered into with the UK on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister confirmed in his reply to a recent parliamentary question that compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists will not be introduced until the road safety authority is established. However, this authority will not be established until the Minister produces amendments to a different Bill. We will have to await the passing of that Bill in both Houses before he begins to address this area.</P>
        <P>There are no regulations with regard to requiring motorcyclists with provisional licenses to display L-plates, which means the law banning learner motorcyclists from carrying pillion passengers cannot be properly enforced.</P><Col N="907"/>
        <P>There has been no move towards changing the licensing regime for learner drivers. The Minister has indicated this will not happen until after the current average waiting time of 40 weeks per driving test centre is significantly reduced. Unfortunately, the Minister&rsquo;s best estimate for this to happen is 18 months to two years. Again, an undue delay will occur before attention is paid to the content of driving tests.</P>
        <P>A new rules of the road booklet has not yet been introduced. The current booklet is approximately ten years old.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a good picture on the front of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin was a Minister and had a beard when the booklet was last published, which indicates how long ago it was. It is a scandal that anybody who begins to learn the rules of the road cannot get an up-to-date rules of the road book. This was brought to the attention of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor three years ago and to the Minister last year but no progress has been made.</P>
        <P>Measures have not yet been finalised which would introduce required standards and training procedures for the recognition of driving instructors.</P>
        <P>While a disproportionate number of larger vehicles are involved in serious road accidents, the Minister has not transposed Directive 2002/85/EC on the fitting of speed limitation devices on HGVs. I recall that the Minister of State appeared on television some months ago to promise that such a step would be taken without delay but no action has resulted. Nothing has been done in terms of the introduction of on-the-spot fines for licensing and tachograph offences by HGV and bus drivers. The directive on working time for HGV and bus drivers has not been transposed.</P>
        <P>A number of issues are outstanding with regard to vehicle standards. No schemes have been introduced for testing imported vehicles before registration or for roadworthiness tests for motorcycles.</P>
        <P>It may be seen from this list, which is not by any means exhaustive, that the Government has a mountain to climb before all of these road safety measures are implemented and is not even in compliance with the reforms required of it by the EU. These problems are compounded by the fact that a great deal of information is missing. The Minister has refused to publish his legal advice on the difficulties of providing legislation for random breath testing. He has not published the 2004 annual report of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which provides details of detection rates and breath testing rates for drink and drug driving. The Government has not published its report <Col N="908"/>on the interdepartmental review of road safety expenditure. The NRA has yet to complete its study of the collection of serious injuries data so, contrary to what was supposed to happen under the current plan, no target has been set.</P>
        <P>Another commitment in the road safety strategy was for 11.1 million vehicles to be checked, per year, by the end of the strategy period. Yet, in replies to parliamentary questions, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not been able to tell us how many vehicles were checked in 2004 as part of the Garda speed limit enforcement programme. How can a target be met if there is no measure of the current activity? We need to see real progress that is measurable and accountable and where clear targets are seen to be met.</P>
        <P>On the issue of achieving targets, let me put something to bed. The Minister for Transport stated at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport last week that all the targets were met in the last strategy. If he bothers to read beyond the preliminary paragraphs of the review of that strategy, he will find that this is simply not the case. While it was undoubtedly a welcome and reasonably successful strategy, the targets for speed reduction, seat belt wearing and the introduction of the full penalty points system were not met and the latter remains outstanding.</P>
        <P>The motion also calls for the immediate establishment of a road safety authority. The Labour Party fully supports the creation of such an authority and would like to see it up and running as soon as possible. There is an urgent need to draw all the strands and agencies dealing with road safety together so that there can be one co-ordinated effort and one coherent voice.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes we should be mindful of Mr. Eddie Shaw&rsquo;s recent remarks that the road safety authority &ldquo;must operate in a radically different legal and operational context, specifically in regard to its governance, autonomy, funding, staff and systems&rdquo;. The Labour Party supports this view and would like to see the new authority become a body with the ethos of a road safety champion as much as a managerial and implementation body. We want to see it become a body that bothers various Departments and agencies rather than simply bowing to them.</P>
        <P>We also believe that in establishing the authority the Minister should seek to change the policy setting and in this context I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to remarks made by Mr. Eddie Shaw in his recent contribution to two D&aacute;il committee meetings in recent times. His submissions contained some very sound advice. The Labour Party believes that the Minister, when he tables his amendments on Committee Stage, should incorporate that advice into the formation of the new road safety authority, and I hope that happens soon.</P><Col N="909"/>
        <P>I want to turn now to the area of driving instruction. This is an area which has been very much neglected. I do not know if people generally are aware that there is no legal requirement for driving instructions to be registered. There are an estimated 2,000 driving instructors but at present only about two thirds of them are actually registered because registration is voluntary. That leaves approximately 600 or 700 instructors who are not registered. One of the functions of the new authority will be to provide for the regulation of driving instructors. So far, however, the Minister has given very little information on what his proposals will entail.</P>
        <P>Many people, particularly parents, would be shocked if they knew just how easy it is to become a driving instructor under the current rules. There is essentially a free-for-all with no Garda clearance required and no minimum standards set down for driving experience, let alone tuition experience. I am not casting aspersions on the current crop of driving instructors, I am merely saying that it is the responsibility of the Government to establish safeguards and set down minimum standards.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to tackle this problem before he establishes the road safety authority. He needs to signal a clear policy to existing and intending driving instructors on what training and accreditation will be required of them so that they can begin to obtain these before the Bill passes into law. He needs to set down clear guidelines in terms of Garda clearance, tuition standards and competency reviews. If he waits until the Bill passes it will be another two or three more years before the regulatory regime will be established satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>I repeat that this motion is not about apportioning blame. It is about taking responsibility and it is time we saw a bit more of that from those on the opposite side of this House.</P>

	<P>I commend Deputy Shortall and my colleagues in Fine Gael, Deputy Mitchell and others, for tabling this important motion. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. That committee embarked on a study of road safety as an ancillary project to the work it was undertaking on insurance costs in the State. Although the committee began from an economic perspective, the shocking information that was presented to it made it examine the human and social aspects of this issue. While we can quantify, in monetary terms, the impact on the State of the multiplicity of road accidents, deaths and injuries, the human tragedy that befalls individual families, weekend after weekend in the appalling litany of carnage that we have become accustomed to, demands a single-minded and determined focus from this House and all agencies of the State.</P><Col N="910"/>
        <P>There are a number of important issues in this debate. Compelling evidence was presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Enterprise and Small Business and on Transport, by representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Safety Council in recent weeks. The National Safety Council told the committees that if the level of deaths here was the same per 100,000 of population as in Sweden, Holland and the UK, on average 20 people fewer per month would die. That is an extraordinary statistic. If we were given a formula to save 20 lives every month, if we were to build an extra hospital or institution to do so, would we not vote it through tomorrow? The council went on to argue:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . from where we are today, we could prevent 140 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries every year. This is achievable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Not only is it achievable, it must be achieved. If we have any conscience in this House, we cannot be indifferent to that plain statement of fact from the people we have asked to look at safety in this State.</P>
        <P>The traffic corps is an important issue in this debate. The first report of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business recommended a traffic corps. That was endorsed in the manifestos of all political parties in the last election, but what is the situation with the traffic corps? How many new members will it have this year? The answer given to the committee by the deputy commissioner was 33. There will be 33 additional personnel for the whole of Ireland in 2005, which will bring the total complement to less than half the promised strength of 1,200, which in itself is hardly an excessive figure. We are crawling to achieve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 33 additional personnel have been allocated to the Garda traffic corps in 2005, giving a total current strength of 565. I can break the figures down by county. There is one additional garda for Clare, one inspector for Cork city, one garda for Limerick, one for Roscommon and so on. That is the reality.</P><Col N="911"/>
        <P>Let me deal with penalty points, which some people have described as a sham. They worked initially because they were announced with a fanfare and people believed they were real, but they are not real. The assistant commissioner told the committee that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating the fixed-charge penalty points system primarily on a manual basis. The new IT system is operating in Dublin, Cork city and parts of the Louth-Meath division. The Garda organisation is in readiness for national roll-out of the fixed charge processing system. However, actual roll-out is dependent upon the signing of the contract for the out-sourcing of payments. That information was given to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on 19 October last, so it is not exactly ancient history. The penalty points system is not fully in place and is not working. Worst of all, somewhat like the boy who cried wolf, because it was announced when it did not have weight or effect, when it actually becomes effective, people will be immune to it and the process will have to begin all over again. This is a shame.</P>
        <P>The key recommendation of the National Safety Council is for an integrated strategy. There is no overall budget or driver for the strategy. My colleague spoke about the need for a fixed road safety authority with power and teeth to co-ordinate and drive and with a budget. I gave the instance of what happened in France where President Chirac, a man I do not normally quote in a positive way, drove an agenda that reduced road deaths. We need that same commitment. With no disrespect to the Minister of State present, I share the despair of my colleague, Deputy Shortall, that it is a Minister of State rather than one of the three line Cabinet Ministers with responsibility in this area who presents himself in this House.</P>
        <P>I could say much more but, unfortunately, time has expired. This is an area on which we all need to work together. It is not a party political issue. We need to have the moral determination to achieve what is achievable and to save lives.</P>

	<P>On 21 June 2005, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, approved a new community nursing unit for Tralee for inclusion in the capital investment framework 2005. The proposed development is a 50-bed community nursing unit to be built on a greenfield site located off the Killerisk Road, Tralee. The facility will comprise two modules of <Col N="912"/>25 beds each, plus ancillary facilities providing continuing care, respite and convalescence care to dependent older people.</P>
        <P>The senior citizens of Tralee have been campaigning for a new community nursing unit for the past seven and a half years. It is a facility that is much needed in Tralee. The current beds available for the elderly in Tralee are located on the top floor of Kerry General Hospital. As a result of this, patients are cut off from all activity and access is difficult. Many of the senior citizens of Tralee must take a bed in St. Columbanus&rsquo;s long-stay hospital in Killarney. It results in considerable inconvenience for their families, especially in the case of elderly relatives who in many instances must use public transport to get to Killarney from Tralee. The round trip from Tralee to Killarney may take an entire day.</P>
        <P>Tralee and its immediate hinterland has a population of more than 30,000 people. It is the only town in the country with this level of population that does not have a community nursing unit or similar facilities to enable patients to access care as close to their local community as is reasonably possible. The seven and a half years of campaigning and the age profile of the people involved has now taken its toll and many of the members are now in care themselves. Sadly, 16 members of the original group that got together to campaign for the community nursing unit are now dead. Many more are worried that they will not live to see this facility made available for the elderly in Tralee.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of people like Ellen Rowan, Christy Tobin and Mair&eacute;ad Fernane who championed this project from the outset. The community nursing unit is at pre-tender stage. I appeal to the Minister and the Health Service Executive to allow this project to proceed to tender immediately so that Tralee can at last have its own community nursing unit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this question last Wednesday and Thursday and I have finally succeeded in having it taken. I tabled it following the failure of the Minister for Transport to listen to the reasoned voices coming from the mid-west and the west urging the need for an economic impact study and an adequate lead-in period before altering the 50-50 share of transatlantic air services guaranteed for Shannon and Dublin since 1993. I understand the Minister for Transport has already gone to the US. He met some of the workers in Shannon this morning and I do not know at this stage what he told them. I am pleased a Minister of State from the mid-west region is present tonight and I hope he will be able to answer some of my questions.</P>
        <P>It is staggering that the Minister for Transport has refused to carry out an impact study, despite a request from a group representing the chambers of commerce of Ennis, Shannon and Limerick, IBEC west and mid-west, SIPTU, IMPACT, the Irish Hotels Federation and tourism and leisure businesses in the region. The mid-west regional authority has also been ignored. I do not know whether this is pure arrogance or a complete lack of concern for the western half of the country, but all these requests have fallen on deaf ears. The Government has seen fit to pay for studies and consultancies on a myriad of subjects &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has graced the newspapers for which the money was found &mdash; yet this vital strategic element that has been a core factor in the economic success of the region is to go with no evaluation of the possible effect of this.</P>
        <P>The Minister appears set on making this momentous change in the regulation of air traffic without any real idea of what will happen. I acknowledge that if things go well, the opportunities could outweigh the losses. However, if things do not go well for Shannon and if all the airlines decide to concentrate their flights in the capital city, which has been a pattern in other European countries where it was allowed, the result could set back drastically the economic development of the mid-west and the west and <Col N="914"/>skew the balance of population and economic activity even more to the eastern seaboard than is the case already. We simply do not know what will happen because the Government has not bothered to find out. This is highly amateur and dangerous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland took the matter seriously. The report carried out by Frederick Sorensen and Alan Dukes stated that Shannon would run into difficulties unless active and forceful supporting activities are undertaken. The US Congress is taking the matter seriously. It has authorised the Secretary of State to prepare a report within 180 days on the effects of ending the dual gateway policy on US businesses operating in western Ireland, Irish businesses operating in and around Shannon Airport and United States carriers serving Ireland. There is genuine fear that a healthy economic framework with hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs could collapse if the vital regular freight and passenger services are withdrawn by airline companies whose only brief is to make money, not to maintain regional economic development. That is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s course of action is not being forced on him either by the US or the EU. The US is prepared to assess the effects of change. The EU has indicated that it would be willing to facilitate a lead-in time. However, I understand from my sources that the Government has not yet requested such a lead-in time. Will the Minister of State&rsquo;s response answer that question?</P>
        <P>A lead-in period of five years would allow for the effects of change to be monitored. It would allow for infrastructural improvements and marketing supports to be put in place. Surely in the week when the same Minister for Transport announced a plethora of transport improvements for Dublin costing billions of euro, including a metro to Dublin Airport, he can do this much for Shannon. He might also do more than a study into the rail link to Shannon.</P>
        <P>I want to ask about our local Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats representatives, one of whom is in the House. Deputy Peter Power has already done a U-turn. The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, have buried their heads in the sand and cast aside the passion they adopted when it threatened Shannon in the past. The ideology of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and his party seems to have won. The ideology of the PDs has obviously carried the day in this regard. The survival of the fittest philosophy is not concerned with regional balance; it is <Col N="915"/>just concerned with allowing the market to make money where it can.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has not yet commenced his talks and it is not too late to ensure that decisions are made with the benefit of knowledge and care. I urge the Government to listen and respond to the broad voice of concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Very little information is being made available. I do not know what was said this morning in Shannon Airport. Very little information is coming to vital interests in the mid-west on the intentions of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in regard to his trip to the US this week. I hope there will be some enlightenment this evening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. However, this matter has been dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, in several parliamentary questions, most recently on 19 October. The Minister has consistently said he does not believe an economic impact study is required.</P>
        <P>The restructuring of the State airports, including Shannon, is intended to enhance their regional focus and the close co-operation between the new Shannon Airport Authority and the other regional development bodies in the area is extremely encouraging. The forecasts for Shannon are good. I object to what Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said about my colleagues, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, Deputy Peter Power, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and Senator Dooley, all of whom have a great interest in the development of Shannon and have knocked on the door of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on many occasions. Perhaps because of their input, commitment and dedication some of what is happening in Shannon arises from the work of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, Deputy Peter Power, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and Senator Dooley and, hopefully, that will continue.</P>
        <P>There are opportunities for Shannon Airport to contribute to the development of the mid-west. The liberalisation of the aviation market between the EU and the US will mean more, not fewer, opportunities for Shannon to develop new routes into North America. We should look at the posi<Col N="916"/>tive side and encourage new opportunities to maximise whatever potential may exist. Currently, Irish airlines are restricted to only five cities in the US for normal scheduled services. However, the advent of open skies will mean Irish or European airlines can fly into any airport in the US. The opening of US airports to services from Ireland, for example, provides an opportunity for the development of Shannon as a hub for passengers or cargo coming from eastern Europe going onwards to the US. It is clearly a matter for the Shannon Airport Authority to pursue these kinds of opportunities. However, without open skies, these opportunities simply will not exist.</P>
        <P>There is clearly demand for service between Ireland and the US. Aer Lingus has been approached by several airports in the US with a view to beginning services. It will be a matter for Shannon Airport to compete and to lobby Irish, European and US airlines to take advantage of this potentially huge increase in new services. This is the central thrust behind the Government&rsquo;s policy of making the State airports independent of each other, so that they can compete with each other and, therefore, collectively provide the best and optimal level of services for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The report prepared by the former head of air transport policy and external aviation relations for the EU Commission and Alan Dukes, director general of the Institute of European Affairs concluded, contrary to what the Deputy may have said, that the EU-US open skies agreement will be beneficial for Ireland, and that Irish business, tourism and aviation will get a boost. The report is clear that Shannon will maintain links to the US but that it must improve its links to Dublin and Europe as a way of underpinning its US services. In that context I am encouraged by the recent new services that are starting from Shannon into Europe and the UK. I understand that has been with much support and encouragement from my Fianna F&aacute;il and PD colleagues in the area and, hopefully, all other political people who can assist will sign up also.</P>
        <P>The report mentions improving transport links around the west and this is addressed in Transport 21, launched last week. Transport 21 identifies the investment that is required to further develop all elements of national transport infrastructure, addressing existing bottlenecks and capacity constraints, enhancing quality, optimising the use of the network and making prudent advance provision for future economic growth. In particular, Transport 21 is all about connectivity. It is regrettable that the Deputy indicated it was only a Dublin plan. It is not. There is a huge amount in it for Limerick and, hopefully, the Deputy will see the benefits of not alone this <Col N="917"/>Government policy but of Transport 21 for her region.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter. The EU Trade Commissioner, Mr. Peter Mandelson, has said the EU cannot avoid action on agriculture to a loss of potential development gain. He also said that if we want the US to reform its domestic subsidy regime and the Brazilians to cut industrial tariffs and to open services we have to move on agricultural tariffs. What he is proposing has created horror in Irish agricultural circles. It is estimated by the IFA that Mr. Peter Mandelson&rsquo;s cuts would cost Irish farmers &euro;800 million annually and would have the potential to wreak havoc on the two big farming enterprises. Low price imports could force beef prices down to &euro;2.07 per kg or 74 cent per pound and milk prices down to 95 cent per gallon.</P>
        <P>The latest proposals include cuts of up to 60% in the tariffs on some farm products. In the case of beef steaks, the proposed 50% cut in tariffs will mean they can be imported into the EU 52% cheaper than the current market price. That has major implications for food security and safety within the EU. This is in the context that the Common Agricultural Policy was reformed in 1992 and subsidies were decoupled in 2003. The successive reductions in customs duties showed that the equivalents of our reductions are being absorbed not by the poorest countries but by the major exporting countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil and so on. This is the double dealing of the large countries that hide behind other poorer countries in order to advance their own positions. In other words, this is being done in the name of the poorest countries but it is far from that. This is unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was anger today when more than 10,000 farmers marched right up to the door of the D&aacute;il. People were very angry outside the EU office in Molesworth Street at what is happening. They were determined it would not happen and demanded that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Taoiseach should intervene to sort out the problem.</P>
        <P>The Irish farmer is the most compliant in the world. He has gone to great lengths to ensure maximum traceability. Recently there have been two foot and mouth scares, yet we are considering importing beef from an area where foot and mouth is endemic, without any proper monitoring. Quality does not come cheap but it is there. Food safety is there but what we are talking about is the other side of the coin &mdash; disease. Irish farmers have first world costs but get Third World prices. The position will get worse. How can a farmer be viable given all the regulations <Col N="918"/>concerning traceability and food safety, which he has gone to great lengths to ensure, will be undermined? How can he turn a penny when his costs are so high? The Irish consumer is getting a good deal. Food costs represent only 8% of the total with the farmer hardly getting one third even though he is the producer. The big rancher in South America will gain in this. The beef barons who own the vast majority of the land will benefit. The small family farmer in Ireland will suffer. This is the antithesis of everything we hope for in farming.</P>
        <P>Irish farmers are abhorred by Peter Mandelson. He is a failure who was sacked twice and some say it is time he was sacked again. He has exceeded his authority and is selling out the Irish farmer. Irish agriculture will be sacrificed on the altar of getting a better deal for industry. However, the farmers will not lie down in this matter. They are prepared to fight back and do whatever is necessary, otherwise they face total annihilation. The concession Mr. Mandelson is offering to the US, which would amount to cuts of up to 60% in EU tariffs on food imports, is unacceptable. It will make farming here unviable.</P>
        <P>Undermining European food security is ill conceived and unworkable. Mr. Mandelson appears determined to go all the way and exceed his authority. He is a dangerous man, wandering around Europe doing very dangerous things that are totally undermining our economy.</P>
        <P>The Minister must have heard how angry the farmers were during their protest today. I hope she can give them the news that she and the Taoiseach will get involved and make a difference to stop this madman Mandelson.</P>

	<P>The negotiations on the next WTO agreement have entered an intensive phase in recent weeks in the run-up to the WTO ministerial conference next month in Hong Kong. Agriculture is one item on a broad trade liberalisation agenda which also includes services, industrial goods and other matters. From our point of view, given the economic and social importance of agriculture, it is obviously a vitally important aspect of the negotiations. The outcome of the agreement will determine the levels of protection and support which will apply to the agriculture sector in the future and the new round could, therefore, have serious implications for the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>The negotiations were launched at the WTO Doha Ministerial Conference in November 2001. In so far as agriculture is concerned, the Doha mandate provides for substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support, reductions with a view to phasing out all forms of export subsidy and substantial improvements in market access. Substantial progress towards conducting a <Col N="919"/>new agreement was made in August 2004 when agreement was reached on a framework document which sets out the broad outline and content of the new round. The negotiations on the details have been under way in the meantime.</P>
        <P>The Commission negotiates on behalf of the member states on the basis of a mandate which was agreed in the Council of Ministers. The mandate is designed to defend the CAP as it has evolved under successive reforms, including Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review, both of which were agreed with a view to positioning the EU in the WTO negotiations. Essentially, the mandate aims to protect the European model of agriculture as an economic sector and a basis for sustainable development based on the multifunctional nature of agriculture and the part it plays in the economy, the environment and society generally.</P>
        <P>I have been concerned that in recent months the Commission has adopted an unnecessarily concessionary approach to the negotiations. These concerns are shared by a number of ministerial colleagues in the Council, and on 14 October I supported a memorandum which was prepared by the French Minister for Agriculture and submitted to the Commissioner, outlining the growing unease at the Commission&rsquo;s approach. The memorandum urged the Commissioner to defend vigorously the EU position on agriculture in accordance with the mandate as agreed by the Council. The French initiative was endorsed by 14 EU Ministers for Agriculture.</P>
        <P>I also strongly supported France&rsquo;s call for an extraordinary meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which was held on 18 October. With several ministerial colleagues I again expressed concern at the negotiating strategy and tactics being adopted by the Commission. I am pleased to say that the conclusions of the Council again endorsed the negotiating mandate and confirmed the CAP reforms are the EU&rsquo;s important contribution to the current negotiations and constitute the limit of the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating mandate. The situation was also discussed again at the Council of Ministers on 24 and 25 October at which I, with many colleagues, sought to have the WTO round discussed in Council of Agriculture and Fisheries meetings in the run-up to the Hong Kong negotiations.</P>
        <P>Let me be clear about the current position. The EU offer has been made by the Commission on the basis that it is within the terms of the nego<Col N="920"/>tiating mandate. I have some reservations in this regard and I will continue to press the Commission on this point. Technical meetings for experts will be held later this week at which the Commission will explain its handling of the negotiations. I will, of course, study the outcome of the technical briefing very carefully.</P>
        <P>My position on the negotiations has not changed from the outset and remains firm. My overall objective remains to ensure that the terms of any new agreement be accommodated within the terms of recent CAP reforms and that further reform will not be required. There should be balance in the negotiations as between the various elements and the pillars of the agriculture negotiations. I will be insisting that agriculture must not, under any circumstances, be sacrificed for the sake of an overall agreement. I do not accept that concessions in agriculture should be a precondition for movement for progress in other aspects of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>I also have a number of priorities. On domestic support, I want to ensure that the system of decoupled direct payments continues to qualify as non-trade-distorting payments under the so-called &ldquo;green box&rdquo; and remain exempt from reductions under the new round. The EU system of direct payments makes a major contribution to farm incomes in Ireland.</P>
        <P>On export subsidies, I want to achieve full parallel treatment of all forms of export subsidy and to ensure that the phasing out, which has been agreed, is carried out over the longest possible period and in a manner least damaging to our interests. Ireland has substantial exports of milk products and beef to third countries which would not be competitive without export refunds.</P>
        <P>On market access, I want to retain the maximum possible level of protection through a combination of tariff cuts and other mechanisms, including the designation of products of particular interest as sensitive products in order to protect our major EU markets from increased competition from imports from third countries.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that I am keeping in very close contact with these negotiations. I am liaising with my Cabinet colleagues and EU ministerial colleagues. I will continue to avail of every opportunity to defend the benefits of the CAP to Irish and EU farmers and to achieve the best possible outcome to the negotiations next month in Hong Kong.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to have a general countrywide review of catchment boundaries. However, reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate. A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a &ldquo;sole provider&rdquo; school closes due to declining enrolment.</P>
        <P>The area development planning initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the commission on school accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas. An area development plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required. Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an area development plan requires such adjustments.</P><Col N="922"/>
        <P>Catchment boundaries have provided and continue to provide a very useful tool in facilitating the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the operation of the national school transport service.</P>

	<P>The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into schools has been examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on foot of a report from a task group set up in 2000 and which included representatives of the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Safety Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, Rosary College Crumlin, the CCEA Northern Ireland and the NCCA. The NCCA also commissioned a study on driver education in post-primary schools from Dr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College Dublin.</P>
        <P>The NCCA, whose role is to advise the Minister for Education and Science on curriculum and assessment issues, recommended that road safety be addressed within the context of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and that driver education and specifically learning to drive for pupils aged 17 should not become part of the school curriculum. The NCCA noted that this concurred with the practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>At the start of the 2001-02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of <i>Rules of the Road</i>. In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive.</P>

	<P>The financial allocation in the main funding line for the youth work sector in 2005 represents an 18% increase in funding over 2004 and brings that financial provision to &euro;33.889 million in 2005. This is clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the youth work sector in Ireland. This additional funding is catering for a number of developments under the Youth Work Act 2001 and the national youth work development plan and for enhancements to existing youth work services.</P>
        <P>In particular, to date in 2005 I have allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the expansion and development of the special projects for youth scheme. This measure is in line with the recommendations of the national youth development plan. Through this scheme, grant-in-aid of just under &euro;16 million is being made available this year in respect of out-of-school projects for disadvantaged and marginalised young people.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have increased funding for the ongoing support and advancement of some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations by 8%, bringing support for these organisations to more than &euro;11 million in 2005. I have also established a fund to develop the capacity of these organisations in preparing themselves organisationally for the further rollout of the Youth Work Act 2001. With regard to youth information provision, support for the national network of youth information centres has also been increased by 8% in 2005.</P>
        <P>I am extremely conscious of the worthwhile work being carried out by the youth work sector and acknowledge the valuable contribution it makes to the non-formal education of our young people. I assure the Deputy of my ongoing support for the sector and its work.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 122, 129, 153 and 198 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Residential Institutions Redress Act provides that the Minister may, by order, include in the Schedule to the Act any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children&rsquo;s home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>A total of 128 institutions were originally listed on the Schedule. Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and-or solicitors in relation to various institutions not specified in the Schedule, including the facility mentioned by the Deputies. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Health and Children was consulted by my Department in relation to the Morning Star mother and baby unit and it advised that this was a privately run facility which was not subject to State inspection or regulation. As a consequence it is not possible to give further consideration to the placement of this unit on the Schedule. The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule at this point.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that in the Government&rsquo;s initiatives to address past abuse, the needs of those who suffered abuse in institutions not covered by the Act is recognised and provided for and a range of measures has been put in place <Col N="925"/>to assist them. These include the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and dedicated counselling and other services for victims of abuse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have spoken to the person recently mentioned by the Deputies, and explained the situation to her. Officials in the Department have also outlined the position in relation to the Morning Star mother and baby unit to the person concerned on a number of occasions. An official from my Department also met the person on 20 October 2005 and explained that the legislation does not allow me to consider including the unit in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act. However, I understand that she was resident as a child in another institution which is included in the Schedule and she has been advised by Department officials that she could explore, in consultation with her legal representative, the possibility of making an application to the redress board based on what happened to her in that institution.</P>

	<P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, which I launched last May, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.</P>
        <P>The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Approximately 600 primary schools and 150 second level schools will be included in the school support programme. The new action plan will be implemented on a phased basis over the next five years, starting during the current school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has increased funding on specific measures at primary and second level to tackle educational disadvantage by some 130% &mdash; from some &euro;50 million in 1998 to about &euro;120 million in the current year. The additional &euro;40 million annual investment under this action plan on full implementation will represent a 33% increase on current expenditure and <Col N="926"/>a three-fold increase in spending in this area since 1998.</P>
        <P>Although the action plan is a five-year programme, a significant proportion of the additional supports involved are scheduled to be introduced during 2006 and 2007. The additional expenditure in 2006 will include investment in areas such as targeted reductions in class sizes at primary level, additional guidance counselling provision and increased access to reading and maths initiatives for pupils with literacy difficulties. While this will involve significant expenditure, announcement of the specific amount involved in 2006 will be made in the context of the publication of the Estimates.</P>
        <P>The action plan will address all of the following key issues and needs: improving identification of disadvantage &mdash; a standardised approach will allow my Department to target resources more effectively; increasing early childhood education provision in the most disadvantaged communities; improving supports for pupils with low attainment levels in literacy and numeracy; enhancing procedures for measuring the outcomes achieved from educational inclusion measures; enhancing integration and partnership working both within the education sector and cross-sectorally; enhancing professional development supports for principals and school staff; and enhancing research and evaluation.</P>

I am considering the broad range of recommendations made by the working group in consultation with my colleague, the Tan&aacute;iste and Minister for Health and Children. We will bring proposals to Government in the near future on a wide range of issues associated with the delivery of medical education in Ireland, including the so-called cap on numbers in undergraduate medical education.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 127, 130 and 165 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that some second level schools do not appear to be doing as much as they could to ensure that students with special needs are as welcome in those schools as students without special needs. I expressed my belief in this regard at the recent annual conference of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals. However, this is a complex area already governed by statute, and I am not sure that it would be amenable to resolution simply by the introduction of regulations.</P>
        <P>The Education Act 1998 requires all schools to have in place an admissions policy, detailing admission to and participation by students with disabilities or who have other special educational needs. The Act also requires schools to ensure that as regards that policy the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a range of supports to all schools to enable them to welcome students with special educational needs. My Department allocates additional teacher support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and VECs to cater for students with special educational needs. The nature and level of support provided in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual student. However, this requires a willingness on the part of schools to be proactive in this area and also a willingness on the part of parents to assert their rights more actively in terms of their choice of school.</P>
        <P>The level of resources being made available to support students with special educational needs in the second level system has grown significantly in recent years. In the current school year, my <Col N="928"/>Department has allocated approximately 1,614 whole-time equivalent teachers and 1,023 special needs assistants to second level schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. This represents an increase of approximately 225 teaching posts and 391 special needs assistant posts on the previous school year.</P>
        <P>Under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will also be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>I have considered the case referred to by the Deputy. The key consideration in this matter is that the present arrangement obtaining in this case is contrary to the provisions of the post-primary school transport scheme and is, therefore, being phased out. The Deputy will appreciate that the scheme is intended to be of general application throughout the country and any departure from its provisions damages its integrity. The decision therefore taken earlier this year, to allow the transport arrangement continue for those pupils already availing of the facility, was fair and reasonable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is an independent body established under statute in December 2002 to provide financial redress to persons who, as children, were abused while resident in industrial schools, reformatories or other institutions that were subject to State regulation or inspection.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures available to my Department are up to 31 October 2005. At that date, the board had received approximately 9,100 applications and had processed some 4,119 of these at a total cost of approximately &euro;310.5 million. The average award is running at approximately &euro;77,000.</P>
        <P>The redress scheme has now been in operation for almost three years and the board will accept applications up to 15 December 2005. Based on the total number of applications the redress board has received to date, and allowing for legal and administration legal costs, it is estimated that the total cost of the scheme may be of the order of &euro;800 million. I should emphasise that this is very much a tentative estimate and may be subject to change in the light of the ongoing administration of the scheme. The final cost of the scheme will not be known until early 2008 when all applications have been processed by the board.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s estimate prior to the establishment of the redress board was that the amount of compensation would be of the order of &euro;500 million, not including legal and administration costs. Including legal and administration costs, the cost of awards under this estimate would be &euro;610 million. While this is lower than the cost now estimated, it was made prior to the commencement of the scheme when there was considerable uncertainty in relation to the number of applications and the average amount that would be awarded by the board. The recent Committee of Public Accounts report acknowledges that the potential liability for redress is dependent on a number of contingencies and future events and that any estimate of the liability is made in circumstances of uncertainty.</P>
        <P>The redress board&rsquo;s estimates in its 2003 and 2004 annual reports were also predicated on a <Col N="930"/>lower number of applications than has turned out to be the case. In its 2003 report the board gave a tentative estimate of final applications of between 6,500 and 7,000 applicants. In its annual report for 2004 the board increased its estimate to between 7,500 and 8,000 applications. The board has emphasised that its estimates of the numbers of applications are tentative as there are no precedents for this scheme.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, I strongly believe that the final cost of the redress scheme must be viewed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s concern to provide reasonable compensation towards the hurt and suffering experienced by victims of abuse and the very substantial costs that would have been incurred in any event if no such scheme had been established and if cases had been processed in the normal manner through the courts.</P>

	<P>There is no doubt that given the increasing number of children with special needs now availing of the opportunity of a mainstream second level education, there is a need to ensure sufficient training supports are in place to enable teachers to provide them with the best service possible. To this end, my Department has put in place a strategy to meet the needs of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs and to ensure that they get the training and ongoing support and advice that they need.</P><Col N="931"/>
        <P>In terms of initial teacher education and development, pre-service primary teacher training courses in the colleges of education have been updated to ensure that they contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special educational needs. At post-primary level, the higher diploma in education and education degree programmes include elements on the learning difficulties of pupils as part of a general alertness orientation programme. There has also been a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes covering the special education area.</P>
        <P>For serving teachers, the provision of in-service training on the area of dealing with special education needs students has been greatly enhanced by the establishment in 2003 and recent expansion of the special education support service, SESS. The SESS is charged with consolidating and co-ordinating in-service provision at local level for personnel working with children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>It also explores various models of in-service and support for teachers in the classroom and is working co-operatively with colleges of education and other agencies to maximise the effects of training and support across the spectrum. Support is also provided to other staff working in schools with special educational needs pupils.</P>
        <P>The nature of special education and the changing needs of school personnel working in a variety of settings require the availability of flexible models of provision. The SESS is specifically designed to support teachers and schools in a flexible way to meet their educational and developmental needs, including the provision of e-learning and the existence of a wide geographical spread of trainers who work on a full-time and, especially, part-time basis. The training available to schools involves direct support to individual teachers, groups of teachers or whole school staffs; the provision of expertise on particular aspects of special needs; accessing appropriate training on request; and empowering schools to identify their own training needs and to provide ongoing support.</P>
        <P>With these measures now in place, many of the recommendations in the OECD report, Teachers Matter, in relation to the area of special needs education are actually being met at this point.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that with the major improvements that I have just outlined, there is now a comprehensive system of training and other supports in place to ensure that the extra teachers that we have put into schools to assist children with special needs are getting the help they need to give each child the best service possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have decided to provide more information, for parents in particular, about our schools in a way that ensures a fair and comprehensive picture of all the different activities in a school.</P>
        <P>As I have said on many occasions, I am strongly opposed to the publication of crude league tables based solely on examination or test results. Such tables provide an unbalanced and grossly limited indication of a school&rsquo;s performance.</P>
        <P>In contrast to school league tables, I believe that school inspection reports from whole school evaluations, WSE, and other inspections can provide balanced and well informed information on schools. The whole school evaluation process involves not only a full examination of all the varied activities of a school &mdash; from teaching standards to the availability of extra-curricular activities, the ethos of the school and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying and health and safety &mdash; but consultation with parents, staff members and students.</P>
        <P>These inspection reports can therefore provide valuable information on the educational and social opportunities provided by a school. The comments that they contain are also fully sensitive to the context in which the school operates in a way which is not possible with league tables.</P>
        <P>Given the breadth of the contents of whole school evaluation reports, I believe that the publication of these and other school inspection reports could go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools. The type of information provided in WSE reports will help parents who need accurate and balanced information. WSE reports also contain valuable information that will be of interest to schools who may wish to learn from the experience of others.</P>
        <P>I am determined to progress this matter in a sensible and responsible way and to ensure that the views of all the education partners are considered before the publication process is finalised. During the summer I put in place a mechanism whereby this can take place. The inspectorate of my Department has held 20 meetings with interested parties in late September and has issued draft guidelines for the publication of inspection reports to the education partners <Col N="933"/>about three weeks ago. Responses to the draft guidelines are expected in mid-November and a final draft of the proposals will be submitted to me in December.</P>
        <P>I intend that the publication of school inspection reports will commence from January 2006 for all inspections carried out from the start of the calendar year 2006.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the considered and responsible approach that we are taking to the publication of inspection reports will lead to much greater availability of information on schools without inadvertently pitting schools serving entirely different communities against each other in crude comparisons of academic performance alone. I believe that this process will also encourage schools to provide extra information of value to parents.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 677 together.</P>
        <P>The Government commitment to reduce class size in junior classes clearly accepts the benefits of class size reductions for younger pupils. The international research shows that reduced class size can produce improved attainment in particular for minority-disadvantaged groups. It also shows that the reduction in class size must be accompanied by a change in teaching style to achieve the benefits and there are indications that variations in teacher quality are particularly important for student achievement.</P>
        <P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 4,500 additional teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. The annual estimated value of the additional expenditure on these posts is more than &euro;200 million.</P>
        <P>In 1996-97, the average class size in our primary schools was 27. It is now 24. In 1996-97, there was one teacher for every 22 children in our primary schools. Today there is one teacher for <Col N="934"/>every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State. Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. While there is more to be done to reduce class sizes further, it should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>While the average class size nationally has been brought down to 24, I am committed, in line with Government policy, to delivering further reductions in class sizes for children under nine years of age. In achieving the Government target in relation to smaller class sizes, priority has, in the first instance, to be given to children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>Under the new action plan for tackling education disadvantage which I launched last May, more children in disadvantaged schools will be in classes of 20 in the current school year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 569 together.</P>
        <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides a statutory scheme of financial redress for persons who, as children, were abused while in residential institutional care. The scheme applies in respect of institutions specified in the Schedule to the Act. Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion in the Schedule of any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children&rsquo;s home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness, in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>A total of 128 institutions were originally listed on the Schedule. Since the enactment of the legis<Col N="935"/>lation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and-or solicitors in relation to various institutions not specified in the Schedule, including mother and baby homes. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has advised my Department that many of the institutions submitted for consideration, including mother and baby homes, were privately operated establishments which were not subject to State inspection or regulation and could not therefore be included in the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule at this point. The issue of any alternative investigations in relation to these homes would be a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

	<P>My Department specifies the minimum academic requirements for entry to primary teacher training courses provided in the colleges of education. As part of these requirements, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have secured a minimum of a grade C in higher level Irish in the leaving certificate, or an approved equivalent. This requirement covers both the written and oral element of a student&rsquo;s proficiency in Irish. My Department considers this required entry level to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels in primary schools. I have no plans to change the entry requirements to primary teacher training courses at present.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established junior certificate, leaving certificate, repeat leaving certificate and transition year programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the leaving certificate vocational programme, post-leaving certificate courses and leaving certificate applied. Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at post-primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.4:1 in the 2004-05 school year. The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities which wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>

	<P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of dis<Col N="938"/>advantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural and 150 second level schools, will be included in the school support programme. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis &mdash; starting in the current school year &mdash; and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>The primary and second level school books grant schemes will continue to operate as before. However, the results of the identification process outlined above will be taken into account in allocating resources under the schemes. Targeted additional funding will also be made available through the schemes, on a phased basis, to schools participating in the SSP. This additional funding will be aimed primarily at supporting the establishment, development and continuing operation of book loan-rental schemes. The specific amount involved in 2006 will be finalised in the context of the Estimates process.</P>

	<P>The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand, Myself and Others, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module, Belonging and Integrating.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with <Col N="939"/>representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>

The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.

The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting in the current school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>A key underlying principle of DEIS is that of early intervention, including assisting children who are having difficulty learning to read and write at an early stage before the problem becomes entrenched. In implementing the action plan a number of measures will be rolled out, on a phased basis, to tackle literacy and numeracy problems in schools serving disadvantaged com<Col N="940"/>munities. These measures will include a new advisory service at primary level; more access to initiatives such as reading recovery and maths recovery which enable intensive, individualised teaching to be provided to the lowest attaining pupils at an early stage when intervention can be most effective; targeted extension of the successful demonstration library project at second level in respect of which 40 more schools will benefit on a phased basis; and a new family literacy project.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has recommended that all pupils should be tested in literacy and numeracy at the end of first or beginning of second class and at the end of fourth or beginning of fifth class and that this should be implemented as soon as it is feasible to do so. My Department is exploring potential implementation models, in advance of entering into discussions with the education partners in the matter. I believe that the introduction of standardised testing on a systematic basis has significant potential to improve the quality of teaching and learning in our schools.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 189 together.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement reached with the religious congregations, the property contribution of the congregations is divided into two separate and distinct schedules of properties as follows. The first schedule of properties is properties to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies or local authorities after the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was set at &euro;36.54 million. I can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with the religious congregations on the transfer of 35 properties under this schedule to the amount of &euro;38.24 million. This figure of &euro;38.24 million includes &euro;4.98 million in cash that was provided by the congregations in lieu of property.</P><Col N="941"/>
        <P>The second schedule of properties is properties transferring from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations from 11 May 1999, the date of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology to victims of child abuse. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was set at &euro;40.32 million. I can confirm that transfers of 29 properties to the value of approximately &euro;36.21 million have been agreed in principle under this schedule. This includes a cash payment of &euro;3.25 million made by the congregations in lieu of property.</P><Col N="942"/>
        <P>Taking account the oversubscription on schedule A, the net outstanding balance under the agreement is approximately &euro;2.4 million and this is currently under discussion with the religious congregations. The properties set out on the following lists &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; were accepted in principle by the Department following receipt of confirmation from relevant Departments and State agencies that it would be to their advantage to accept title to the particular property. The current or future use of these properties is a matter for each of the transferees.</P><Col N="941"/>

	<P>I am aware of the decreasing numbers of males entering the teaching profession, and it is an issue that is of concern to me. I believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>I genuinely believe that teaching should be seen as an attractive profession for both men and women. Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution. With the increases in <Col N="944"/>teachers&rsquo; salaries under partnership agreements and benchmarking in recent years, it is also now a well-paid job.</P>
        <P>This Government wants to attract and reward the best teachers. In addition to increasing teachers&rsquo; salaries, we have also undertaken other initiatives to enhance the status of the profession. Not least of these is the establishment of the Teaching Council as a professional regulatory body.</P>
        <P>I have also now received the report of the primary education committee, Males into Primary Teaching. The primary education committee was established to examine a range of issues in relation to males entering primary teaching and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard. The report draws on the professional insight of key experts in this area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies. The report&rsquo;s findings will be of significant <Col N="945"/>benefit in assisting the development of future policy in this important area.</P>
        <P>One of the key recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report is that a co-ordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching, should be undertaken. Officials in my Department are examining how such a promotion campaign can be run to maximum effect. All other recommendations contained in the report are also receiving active consideration</P>

	<P>My Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland are jointly engaged in the development of the Middletown centre for autism in County Armagh. Both Departments have jointly funded the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown, and plan to refurbish the property with a view to developing a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders. Four key services will be provided by the centre, including a learning support service on a residential basis; an educational assessment service; a training and advisory service; and an autism research and information service.</P>
        <P>A number of working groups are continuing to address the legal, financial, organisational and infrastructural aspects of the proposal. For example, work is continuing on the development of a campus masterplan for the Middletown property which, when complete, will guide the commissioning of any necessary infrastructure and refurbishment works. Officials from both Departments are working closely on this project and this interaction between the two Departments will continue over the coming months with a view to ensuring that the centre becomes operational as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The transition year programme is a <Col N="946"/>one-year optional programme, taken by some 24,000 students annually, which provides a bridge between junior and senior cycle. Its aim is to promote the personal, social, educational and vocational development of students and prepare them for their role as participative and responsible members of society.</P>
        <P>The curriculum for the transition year is devised by the individual school, having regard to the guidelines issued by my Department which set the broad parameters within which transition year programmes should operate. The guidelines allow individual schools scope to create a programme of learning experiences that matches the needs of their particular student cohort and that takes account of the resources and opportunities available in the schools and their local community.</P>
        <P>An evaluation of the transition year programme in 146 schools was carried out by the inspectorate of my Department in 1996 and the findings were largely positive. My Department has followed through on the recommendations issued to schools during this evaluation in a variety of ways, for example, the transition year curriculum support service has intensified its support in areas identified as needing improvement, and circular letter M1/00 was issued to clarify requirements for schools implementing the transition year programme. Schools were also provided with additional guidelines on writing their transition year programme.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, conducted a study of the transition year programme in schools. This study was funded by my Department and the report was published in January 2005. Based on data gathered from 468 principals, 4,444 students in 108 schools and six case studies, this study provides a comprehensive examination of all aspects of the operation of transition year and of its effect on student outcomes in a range of school contexts. It confirms that the programme has huge potential to develop students&rsquo; broader life skills and confidence and that it can contribute significantly to building positive student-teacher relationships. The report points to better academic outcomes and increased rates of progression to higher education among transition year students. It identifies making the programme more attractive to disadvantaged schools as a clear challenge for the future. In my response to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on its advice around senior cycle reform, I have requested that the needs of students in these schools be particularly addressed as the proposed curriculum components are developed further.</P>
        <P>The transition year programme is evaluated and reported upon on an ongoing basis in individual schools by my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate as part of its overall inspection plan.</P>

	<P>Schools are privately managed institutions which, although funded by the State, enjoy a large degree of autonomy. It is, therefore, primarily a matter for each school to devise policies around the types of food that are available on the school premises and such policies should be driven by the needs and welfare of the pupils. I know that many schools have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents&rsquo; associations and I would encourage others to do so.</P>

	<P>There are five leaving certificate science subjects, each of which is offered at higher and ordinary levels. This range of subjects is necessary to ensure that courses are available in the different branches of science to match the varying needs, interests, ability levels and career plans of senior cycle students. The availability of these subjects also affords schools a degree of flexibility that is important when planning to meet the needs of their students.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>Significant progress is being made in regard to curricular reform and in-service support for science at both primary and post-primary levels. Science was introduced as a key component in the revised primary school curriculum in 1999 and it has been implemented in all schools since September 2003. A revised junior certificate syllabus was introduced in September 2003 for first examination in June 2006. I believe that this syllabus with its hands-on investigative approach and its new emphasis on scientific process will be particularly instrumental in encouraging more pupils to continue science in senior cycle, especially as the completion of 30 mandatory experiments will now be a requirement for all students.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>For the leaving certificate, revised syllabi have already been fully implemented in biology, physics and chemistry. Each of these curricular changes is being or has been supported by national in-service programmes for teachers. To complete the cycle of revision, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is work<Col N="948"/>ing on the development of a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the current physics and chemistry combined syllabus and a revision of agricultural science is very well advanced. All of these developments and supports have been designed and implemented to encourage students&rsquo; interest in science from an early age and to increase uptake of science-related courses at third level.</P>
        <P>My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and at third level. Progress in these areas is a vitally important part of our national strategy to support competitiveness and employment. My Department&rsquo;s work in supporting and promoting science work will continue to be progressed and enhanced, as resources permit, in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and industry.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 170 together.</P>
        <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, that is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>As of October 2005, NEPS psychologists provided a dedicated service to a total of 1,623 primary schools and to 563 post-primary schools. The latter figure does not include 46 City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, CDVEC, schools that have a VEC educational psychological service.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>NEPS provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodation in certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>The number of NEPS psychologists has increased almost three-fold, from 43 on establishment to 123 at present. The Public Appointments Service has recently established new recruitment panels for NEPS. Regional panels are now in place and this will enable my Department to give priority to filling vacancies in areas of greatest need. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 183 and 192 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Child protection and the implementation of the stay safe programme for all children in every primary school are priorities for my Department. The Stay Safe programme, which is also known as the child abuse prevention programme, CAPP, is a primary school-based approach to the prevention of child abuse. The programme aims to reduce vulnerability to child abuse through the provision of in-service training for teachers, parent education and personal safety education for children at primary school level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Stay Safe programme is a four-stage approach to preventing child abuse involving children&rsquo;s safety education; teacher training; parent education; and community awareness. The programme aims to give children the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse-vic<Col N="950"/>timisation and teaches them that they should always tell an adult who can help of any situation which they find unsafe, upsetting, threatening, dangerous or abusive. Stay Safe is a personal safety skills programme which can be used with primary school children from senior infants to sixth class. It seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protective skills by participating in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, touches, secrets, telling and strangers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An initial one-day in-service training seminar on the stay safe programme has been provided for all primary schools. Since the programme was introduced, 99.7% of primary schools have participated in this training. At present, approximately based on a sample survey 80% to 85% of primary schools are teaching the programme to their students, but it should be recognised that the Stay Safe programme is not mandatory and schools can decide whether to introduce the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should be noted, however, that the central elements of the programme, primarily personal safety strategies and, more importantly, the overall issue of child protection, are now taught as integral parts of the subject of social, personal and health education, SPHE, which is part of the curriculum taught in every primary school. Specifically, the strand unit entitled Safety and Protection provides material for teachers to explore with children appropriate strategies in personal safety which incorporate elements of the stay safe programme. In addition, the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s child protection guidelines for all primary schools has given an additional impetus to the Stay Safe programme as well as the overall issue of child protection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current high level of take-up of the Stay Safe programme combined with the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s child protection guidelines and the incorporation of the central elements of the Stay Safe programme in addition to the coverage of the overall issue of child protection within SPHE is very positive. I would strongly encourage all schools to use the Stay Safe programme.</P>

	<P>A key element of DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved tar<Col N="951"/>geting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis process is being managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department. This process is being assisted by an advisory group, and will be supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town schools and 300 rural schools, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. It is anticipated that the identification process will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 190 together.</P>
        <P>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual second level school is a matter for the relevant school authority. First-time appointment is normally achieved through a system of open competition following advertisement which details the subject requirements of the post. Selection is by means of interview which takes into account the suitability of the qualifications of the applicant for the post as advertised, any relevant experience as well as other factors relating to the applicants general suitability for the post. There is a responsibility on the school authorities to ensure that the selection process is fair and impartial. The objective is to select the most suitable candidate for the post.</P>
        <P>From time to time, my Department receives complaints from disappointed applicants for teaching positions. As the matters complained of generally come within the remit of the school authority, the complainants are advised to bring the matters complained of to the attention of the relevant authority. In the event that the com<Col N="952"/>plainant is dissatisfied with the response of the school authority, contact may be made with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which operates a comprehensive employee rights advisory service.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement is 94, comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers, SEWOs, and 61 educational welfare officers, EWOs. Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving an education. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
        <P>The board has indicated to my Department that the average caseload of each educational welfare officer as at September 2005 was about 108. This has reduced from the July average of 164 arising from the filling of the ten additional EWO posts. The board is continually reviewing the protocols for prioritising children and families who require intervention to ensure that children with greatest need gain maximum benefit from available resources and working with local agencies in prioritising children&rsquo;s and family needs.</P>
        <P>In this regard, there are some 490 staff in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element. My Department is anxious to ensure that the <Col N="953"/>maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between the different services involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 624, 625, 676 and 679 together.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has dramatically increased the number of teachers in schools. At primary level more then 4,500 additional teachers, including nearly 2,500 resource teachers, have been employed. At post-primary level approximately 1,900 additional teaching posts have been allocated during this period. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disad<Col N="954"/>vantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource and learning support teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 &mdash; projected &mdash; in 2004-05 at primary level, and from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year at post-primary level. At primary level average class size has been reduced from 26.6 in 1996-97 to 23.9 in 2003-04. Significantly smaller classes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break &mdash; Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. At primary level, the staffing allocation system is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of more than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes in the school.</P>
        <P>In relation to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by the Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, the Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P><Col N="955"/>
        <P>In recent years improvements have been made under various schemes. In 1999 an ex-quota allocation was made to all second level schools in the free education scheme in respect of remedial education and the home-school-community liaison scheme was extended to all schools designated disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>In 2000 a decision was made to reduce the general pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1 and additional posts were also provided for leaving certificate applied, junior certificate programme and the guidance enhancement initiative resulting in approximately 1,000 additional posts in the sector.</P>
        <P>The number of teaching posts allocated to cater for pupils with special educational needs has increased from 559 whole-time equivalents, WTE, in 2001-02 to 1,599 whole-time equivalents, WTE, in the current school year. In addition, the Department has provided for an additional allocation of 100 posts to guidance from September 2005.</P>

	<P>All recognised primary and post-primary schools are required to offer relationships and sexuality education, RSE. It is an integral part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle post-primary level. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for junior cycle and senior cycle have also been published and distributed to schools by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is also being developed.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of the SPHE curricula are to foster the personal development, health and well-being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens; to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making; and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</P>
        <P>The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and, in addition, addresses issues such as pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault and accepting sexual orientation.</P><Col N="956"/>
        <P>A national SPHE support service was established in September 2000 and provides a full-time support service in collaboration with the health boards to assist schools to deliver the programme. SPHE programmes are designed to enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in their future lives.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 178 and 596 together.</P>
        <P>The level of funding that my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Scoileanna L&aacute;nghaeilge, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.</P>
        <P>However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The amount provided in 2005 was &euro;81,133.</P>
        <P>The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, I, as Minister, am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State.</P>
        <P>Applying this provision to the development of multi-denominational education, at primary level, my Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denomi<Col N="957"/>national schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post primary level, the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through non-designated vocational education committee schools.</P>
        <P>To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster &mdash; such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band one rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable.</P>
        <P>These measures are a strong indication of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do so as part of its own statutory obligations and in the context of the national development plan which is structured to support the development of all educational sectors regardless of ethos.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband connectivity is one of a number of facets of my Department&rsquo;s ICT initiative which aims to integrate information and communications technology into teaching and learning in first and second level schools. The key elements to achieving this objective are access to the technologies, the development of skills in their usage and the availability of high quality curricular relevant digital content. Broadband connectivity is seen as a key enabler within this process. The Deputy will be aware that significant resources have been invested in <Col N="958"/>ICT infrastructure in schools since 1998, initially in the acquisition of computers and peripherals and more recently in the development of computer networking facilities in schools.</P>
        <P>In parallel a range of teacher training courses have been developed by the National Centre for Technology in Education and made available to teachers via the regional education centres. The courses range from basic computer operation to higher order technical skills of network management, website design, Internet use, digital media and a number of general and subject specific pedagogical ICT courses. In addition an ICT advisory service has been developed to provide school authorities and teachers with advice and assistance in the range of technical and pedagogical needs.</P>
        <P>High quality digital content is essential to ensuring effective use of ICT in the classroom. In this context, the Scoilnet portal has been developed to provide a focal point of reference and a resource for teachers, students and parents. This portal site provides significant amounts of curriculum relevant content linking to over 6,000 websites, the content of which is aligned directly to curricular and subject areas. Work is ongoing, in collaboration with teachers, in building relevant indigenous content on the site, much of it in partnership with other agencies such as RTE, subject teachers&rsquo; associations and others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NCTE is also working with the European Schoolnet, EUN, to implement a technological infrastructure to allow Irish schools to share access to a wide range of online educational databases located around Europe. An important aspect of this process is the development of an application profile for Irish curricular content to facilitate metatagging of content to international standards. The NCTE is collaborating with the NCCA in this regard and the acquisition of a range of on-line reference libraries is also being considered.</P>

	<P>The Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost &euro;2 billion was invested in school buildings and in the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large-scale refurbishments-extensions. Funding for school building and renovation projects has increased five-fold since 1997. In 2005, &euro;493 million will be spent on school <Col N="960"/>building projects, compared to just &euro;92 million in 1997.</P>
        <P>Well in excess of 1,300 schools will benefit from the announcements that I have made so far this year with regard to the school buildings and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The list of projects approved to date includes: large-scale projects to tender and construction over the next 12 to 15 months &mdash; 122, 89 primary and 33 post-primary; small schools initiative &mdash; 97, all primary; permanent accommodation initiative &mdash; 75, 70 primary and five post-primary; prefabs &mdash; 140, 137 primary and three post-primary; authorised to enter design phase &mdash; 43, 32 primary and 11 post-primary; summer works &mdash; 741, 452 primary and 289 post-primary; progress through architectural planning &mdash; 124, 73 primary and 51 post-primary; and PPPs &mdash; 27, 23 post-primary and four primary in 22 locations.</P>
        <P>The total number of schools benefiting from this year&rsquo;s announcements is 1,369. The total allocation for my primary and post primary capital budget this year is an unprecedented &euro;493 million, &euro;270 million for primary and &euro;223 million for post-primary.</P>
        <P>This level of investment will need to be maintained if the goal of eliminating sub-standard accommodation is to be achieved. The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that many primary schools with high numbers of children with special learning needs have lost teachers as a result of the introduction of the weighted system; if teachers will be restored to those schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the general allocation of learning support-resource teachers, LS-RTs, is intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs. The system was constructed so that LS-RT allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>The new system has a number of benefits associated with it. It puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols; it reduces the need <Col N="961"/>for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; and it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services.</P>
        <P>In introducing the general allocation system transitional arrangements were also introduced whereby transitional hours were allocated to schools to cater for children for whom individual teaching resources had previously been allocated but which it would not have been possible for the school to continue to provide from its general allocation. In the circumstances no child should have experienced a loss of resource teaching support.</P>
        <P>It has always been the case, however, that schools in receipt of resource teacher support in respect of pupils with special educational needs would lose teacher support, either full posts or part-time hours, when the pupils that triggered the extra support left the school.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances I do not propose to restore learning support-resource teachers to schools that no longer need them. It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that at this stage the general allocation system is working well and has been favourably received by schools. My Department will continue to work with schools and the education partners with a view to ensuring that this remains the case going forward.</P>
        <P>I would add that there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>

	<P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which will be introduced on a phased basis starting during the current school year, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education &mdash; three to 18 years &mdash; from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of <Col N="964"/>about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. It is anticipated that the identification process will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The action plan addresses all the following key issues and needs: improving identification of disadvantage &mdash; a standardised approach will allow my Department to target resources more effectively; increasing early childhood education provision in the most disadvantaged communities; improving supports for pupils with low attainment levels in literacy and numeracy; enhancing procedures for measuring the outcomes achieved from educational inclusion measures; enhancing integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and cross-sectorally; enhancing professional development supports for principals and school staff; and enhancing research and evaluation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>The task force on student behaviour will complete a final report, including recommendations, later this year. In its interim report, the task force recognises that the most important feature of its work is to generate a set of recommendations that will impact in a positive way and will help to curtail the spread of disruptive behaviour in our schools. At its interim report stage, the task force decided to document the broad areas that are emerging and that will form the bedrock of its recommendations in its final report which is expected in December 2005.</P>
        <P>Since the task force was established early this year, it has come to grips with the breadth and complexity of this vitally important area. In tack<Col N="965"/>ling its job it has consulted widely and built upon submissions, research and its own analysis to define sharply the areas where, in its final report, it will make recommendations to underpin future change.</P>
        <P>I am particularly impressed with the ability of the task force to focus on the core issues. It has indicated to me that it is on target to produce a final report and detailed recommendations in December of this year. Before producing that report it wanted to engage further with the wide range of interests in this area and to review what works and does not work both domestically and internationally. I am greatly encouraged by this interim report and I look forward to receiving the final report and its recommendations.</P>

	<P>The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not readily available. However, in relation to PE facilities in primary schools generally, the PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
        <P>My Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the design process for new school buildings or where an existing school building is undergoing major refurbishment. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, the school planning section of my Department is working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising my Department&rsquo;s land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools <Col N="966"/>with enhanced facilities such as sports facilities, playing pitches etc.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is undertaking a national audit of sports facilities in communities around the country, which will also provide useful information on facilities available to schools.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 180 together.</P>
        <P>Given the clear link between early school leaving and continued socio-economic disadvantage in adult life, the Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to complete their education.</P>
        <P>To this end, we are providing increased resources for schools in disadvantaged areas to improve their school completion rates by offering extra supports for their students. These include extra educational supports and services such as breakfast clubs and homework supports. Working with parents to promote school attendance is also an important part of the work of the home school community liaison officers appointed to our disadvantaged schools.</P>
        <P>Other measures designed to improve school completion include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002 with a remit to monitor school attendance, help parents to get a school place for their child and run promotional campaigns on the importance of finishing school. The priority that this Government attaches to tackling early school leaving is evident from the fact that the budget for the welfare board has been increased by 20% in 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of &euro;24 million is being provided this year for the school completion programme, which is one of our key interventions to combat early school leaving and educational disadvantage and is developing strong links between primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas. In addition, my Department supports youth encounter projects, YEPs, which provide educational facilities to young people who have become alienated from the conventional school system.</P><Col N="967"/>
        <P>Increased integration will also be promoted between the work of second level schools and centres catering for young early school leavers, particularly Youthreach centres and senior Traveller training centres.</P>
        <P>Under the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, which I launched in May, additional supports are being targeted at children in the most disadvantaged schools to encourage them to stay in school. The key principle of early intervention to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early is a major component of the plan.</P>
        <P>Under DEIS, additional clusters will be created under the school completion programme which provides a wide range of targeted supports on an individual and group basis to children and young people who may be at risk of early school leaving. The services of the home school community liaison scheme will also be extended and a continuing emphasis will be placed on the development of effective transfer programmes by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the school completion programme. An additional guidance counselling provision, being made available for second level schools having the highest concentrations of disadvantage, will also assist to increase retention rates.</P>
        <P>We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process under DEIS by the end of the year. I am committed to ensuring our policies strive to increase the retention rate of students in our schools.</P>

	<P>The strategic goal set at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 is to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, by 2010. Education and training have a central role in achieving the Lisbon goal. My Department has taken a range of policy initiatives and measures in recent years which contribute to developing the knowledge society and achieving the Lisbon goal.</P><Col N="968"/>
        <P>At post-primary level, significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio in recent years. The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.4:1 in the 2004-05 school year. My Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years with regard to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. To date, at second level, there are 1,614 whole-time equivalent teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 1,023 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>Since 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of locally based special education needs organisers, is responsible for processing any applications for additional special educational needs resources. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>
        <P>Given the clear link between early school leaving and continued socio-economic disadvantage in adult life, the Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support he or she needs to enable her or her to complete his or her education. To this end, we are providing increased resources for schools in disadvantaged areas to improve their school completion rates by offering extra supports for their students.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175, 195 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, for parents, for agencies that work with children and for society generally and I assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all it can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.</P>
        <P>In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools as well as special needs assistants and bus escorts to children with special needs. My colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for chil<Col N="970"/>dren, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the unit to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon decentralisation targeted for mid-November this year. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children.</P>
        <P>The issue of vetting members of boards of management raises the wider issue of vetting people who volunteer in the education sector. My view is that the determining factor in deciding whether or not such persons should be vetted is the extent to which they have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults. In consultation with the education partners, I intend to examine this issue closely as the Garda vetting service expands.</P>

	<P>The child protection guidelines for post-primary schools were drawn up following a consultation process with the education partners. The guidelines are based on children first, the national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. Sufficient copies of the guidelines have issued to all post-primary schools so that each staff member can be provided with his or her personal copy. An area of my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>http://www.education.ie</i>, has been specifically designated to the subject of child protection.</P>
        <P>Boards of management are required to formally adopt the guidelines as official school policy on child protection and are required to formally appoint a designated liaison person, DLP, usually the principal, and deputy designated liaison person. The DLP is responsible for briefing all school staff on the adoption and implementation of the guidelines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A training programme for designated personnel commenced in November 2004 and ran throughout the last school year. Schools which were unable to avail of this training in 2004-05 have since been offered a further programme of courses in the first term of the current school year. A programme of follow-up training for DLPs and deputy DLPs will commence in 2006. Following discussions with the three post-primary management bodies, agreement was reached on <Col N="972"/>the provision by those bodies of an advisory service to support DLPs in delivering in-school briefings on the guidelines and in dealing with issues arising. This service commenced in September of this year. On completion of the final schedule of introductory in-service, my Department will be seeking confirmation from each school that the board of management has formally adopted the guidelines and appointed a DLP and a deputy DLP.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The cost of salaries and allowances paid to teachers in fee-paying post-primary schools for the 2004-05 school year was &euro;89,612,639. The State has traditionally paid the salaries of teachers in fee-paying schools for a number of reasons. For example, if fee-paying schools were to close and the pupils were to move to the non-fee paying sector, the cost to the State would be higher. Whether children attend fee-paying or non-fee-paying schools, teachers would have to be paid. It also ensures all teachers, irrespective of where they teach, are paid equally in accordance with their qualifications and experience.</P>
        <P>Considerations of State support for minority religions have also been important, given that much of the fee-paying sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos. The funding of teacher salaries in fee-paying schools by the State has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular <Col N="973"/>school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement is currently 94, comprising 16 HQ and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers and 61 educational welfare officers. Five regional teams have been established, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. Since September 2005, every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
        <P>There are some 490 staff in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently, work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between the different services involved. I will be keeping the issue of the National Educational Welfare Board&rsquo;s staffing under review. However, I am anxious to secure greater efficiencies through integrated working and by examining the scope for improvements in operational procedures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 196 together.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement for second level schools to produce such a report. However, the Education Act 1998 requires the board of management of a school to establish procedures for informing the parents of students in the school of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school. Such procedures may include the publication of a report on the operation and performance of the school in any school year. The methods by which such information is provided remains a matter for the board of management.</P>
        <P>For example, I understand that it is common practice in many schools that an annual report is prepared for the final meeting of the board of management each year. This normally refers to how successfully policies were implemented during the year, highlights particular achievements and states priorities for the next school year. Some schools may send a synopsis of this report to parents. The practice of reporting in the above manner to boards of management is encouraged by some of the trustee bodies. Reports are normally sent to the trustee body.</P>
        <P>There is also a growing trend whereby principals give a report on the activities of the school in the previous school year, as well as indicating planned activities for the coming school year, to the AGM of the parents&rsquo; association at the beginning of a new school year. Many schools send a newsletter to parents at intervals during the year or at the end of the school year. Normally, information is included on planned and achieved school activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my address to the annual conference of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals last month, I also spoke of the value of schools sharing the outcomes of their ongoing self-review processes with parents and encouraged more to do so. As the Deputy will be aware, I am determined to provide more information, for parents in particular, about our schools, in a way that ensures a fair and comprehensive picture of all the different activities in a school.</P>
        <P>As I have said on many occasions, I am strongly opposed to the publication of crude league tables based solely on examination or test results. Such tables provide an unbalanced and grossly limited indication of a school&rsquo;s performance. In contrast to school league tables, I believe that school inspection reports from whole school evaluations and other inspections, when read in their entirety, can provide balanced and well-informed information on schools. The whole school evaluation process involves an examination of all the varied activities of a school, from the quality of teaching and learning to the availability of extra-curricular activities and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying and health and safety. The inspection process also <Col N="975"/>includes consultation with the school&rsquo;s board, parents and staff members, and, at second level, with the school&rsquo;s students. Whole school evaluation reports can, therefore, provide valuable information on the educational and social opportunities provided by a school. The comments that they contain are also fully sensitive to the context in which the school operates in a way which is not possible with league tables.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the breadth of the contents of whole school evaluation reports, I believe that the publication of these and other school inspection reports could go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools. The type of information provided in whole school evaluation reports will help parents who need accurate and balanced information. Whole school evaluation reports also contain valuable information that will be of interest to schools which may wish to learn from the experience of others.</P>
        <P>I am determined to progress this matter in a sensible and responsible way and to ensure that the views of all the education partners are considered before the publication process is finalised. During the summer, I put in place a mechanism whereby this can take place. The inspectorate of my Department has held no less than 20 meetings with interested parties over the past month and is currently preparing draft guidelines for the publication of inspection reports which will be circulated shortly to the education partners. Responses to the draft guidelines will then be sought and a final draft of the proposals will be submitted to me in December. I intend that the publication of school inspection reports will commence from January 2006 for all inspections carried out from the start of the calendar year 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process, the discussions held to date have been very fruitful and constructive. I know that each of the partners realises the need to address the information deficit that exists at present in terms of ensuring full public access to balanced information on schools. This is especially important to those who, like myself, are opposed to the publication of league tables and want to find a better way.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the considered and responsible approach that we are taking to the publication of inspection reports will lead to much greater availability of information on schools without inadvertently pitting schools serving entirely different communities against each other in crude comparisons of academic performance alone. Whether intended or not, academic league tables would be a likely consequence of publishing exam results in an annual report for each school.</P>

	<P>My Department provides for home tuition to be made available to pupils who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical. Grants are available for nine hours tuition per week for a period of up to ten weeks.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the school completion programme, as a specific gender equality measure, my Department currently supports the educational element of six teenage parenting projects under the teenage parenting support initiative. Following an evaluation of the pilot phase, this initiative was mainstreamed under the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and my Department is represented on the advisory committee. Each teenage parenting support project has made links with a school completion project in their area, assisted by the school completion project national co-ordination team and the teenage parenting support initiative co-ordinators.</P>
        <P>The young parents supported by the teenage parenting projects are given the opportunity to reach their full potential through continued participation in education and training. It is envisaged that this will improve their life opportunities and reduce the likelihood of the young family experiencing poverty and social exclusion and being long-term dependants on State support.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the participation of people with child care responsibilities in further education, my Department provides funding to VECs to assist towards the child care expenses of participants in certain further education programmes. These are the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach and senior Traveller training centre programmes. The administration of these grants is a matter for individual VECs and students in the relevant programmes can apply for them, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I recently launched a booklet entitled information for young parents in education, published by Treoir. The booklet provides information on the various options which are available to young parents and pregnant teenagers to enable them to remain in or return to education. It contains information on various programmes which are currently available for young parents, including financial supports and supports for child care. In addition to programmes provided under the remit of the Department of Education and Science, these include the back to education allowance scheme. This scheme is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is a <Col N="977"/>second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to joining or returning to the workforce.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that solicitors charged fees to their clients on top of the costs paid by the Residential Institution Redress Board in advance of the publicity in recent weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 27 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that all reasonable legal costs and other costs associated with the preparation and presentation of an application to the board will be met by the board. In the event that agreement cannot be reached between the board and the applicant&rsquo;s legal representative, the matter is referred to the taxing master of the High Court for determination.</P>
        <P>The board&rsquo;s published guidelines and other publicity material on the redress scheme specifically highlight the fact that all reasonable legal costs incurred in respect of applications for redress are payable by the board. Furthermore, as solicitors are required under law to fully inform their clients, in writing, of the legal costs payable in their case, it is incumbent on the solicitor to inform an applicant to the board that all reasonable legal costs will be met by the board and that the applicant should not have to pay any legal costs.</P>
        <P>The Law Society of Ireland is the body responsible under law for regulating the solicitor profession and as such it is a matter for the society to investigate complaints about the conduct of a solicitor. Earlier this year, my Department became aware that the society had taken the view that it was precluded from investigating complaints from applicants with regard to overcharging by solicitors as a result of the prohibition on disclosure of information under section 28 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. Arising from this, I included an amendment to this section on Committee Stage of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005 to enable the Law Society to investigate such complaints. This Bill was enacted into law on 9 July 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The redress scheme was set up by the Government to help alleviate the injury and suffering experienced by victims of child abuse in residential institutional care. Awards made by the board are payable in full to the applicant, without any <Col N="978"/>deduction for costs. It is a disgraceful practice that some solicitors would take advantage of their clients by overcharging as reported. I welcome the steps which are being taken by the Law Society to examine and deal with the issue of overcharging by solicitors. I understand that some people have already been refunded by solicitors and that the society will take whatever further action is appropriate, first, to ensure that all persons who were wrongly charged fees are fully reimbursed and, second, to prevent a recurrence of this practice. I have also discussed the matter with the Attorney General, who is in correspondence with the Law Society on the issue. I expect that the results of the investigation undertaken by the society will be made known to the Government and the public as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The national youth work development plan, together with the Youth Work Act 2001, provides a framework for youth work in Ireland. The plan identifies four main goals and proposes 50 action points to achieve these goals over a five-year period.</P>
        <P>To date, a number of priority action areas have been addressed. In 2003, &euro;80,000 was spent on the implementation of a child protection training programme for the sector. In 2004, &euro;500,000 was made available for the roll-out of the plan and was spent on further support for the child protection training programme, development of projects funded under the special projects for youth scheme and increased support to youth information centres and the youth information support partnership. In 2005, an 18% increase in the main funding line for the youth work sector has been provided. This additional funding is catering for a number of developments under the Youth Work Act 2001 and the national youth work development plan and for enhancements to existing services.</P>
        <P>With regard to the national youth work development plan, to date in 2005, additional funding has been provided in the following areas: the establishment of ten new special projects for disadvantaged youth; the upgrade of 20 single worker special projects to two worker projects; review of youth work funding; review of youth information provision; continued support of the child protection training programme; establishment of a development fund for youth work organisations and North-South youth work train<Col N="979"/>ing endorsement panel. It is expected that in the region of &euro;1.6 million will be expended in 2005 on these and other action areas which are currently being progressed. The financial provision required for 2006 and 2007 will be determined by the actions of the plan identified and agreed for implementation each year, having regard to available financial resources.</P>

	<P>The OECD review of Irish higher education makes a series of far-reaching recommendations for reform and development of the sector, against the backdrop of the crucial role which has been identified for it in helping to achieve the broad strategic national goal of becoming a leading knowledge-based society.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Government approved the broad reform agenda outlined by the OECD and the bringing forward of legislative proposals to transfer responsibility for management of the institutes of technology from my Department to the Higher Education Authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is being drafted and effecting this transfer will be a key priority of my Department in the coming year. The bringing together of universities and institutes of technology under a common management structure will facilitate the development of a more strategic approach to higher education within a unified policy framework and the gradual devolution to the institutes of technology of greater academic and managerial autonomy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In April of this year, in outlining a detailed response to the OECD recommendations, I announced my intention to create a strategic innovation fund to incentivise reform and modernisation in the sector. Planning for this is at an advanced stage, with detailed criteria for the fund currently being finalised by my Department and the Higher Education Authority. I expect to be in a position to announce funding for a call for proposals in 2006 shortly. Development of a new funding model for third level institutions by the <Col N="981"/>Higher Education Authority is also at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>Action on a number of other issues raised in the review is also already underway, in particular the proposal by the OECD that research and development issues should be co-ordinated across Departments and agencies. The interdepartmental committee on science, technology and innovation is now playing an active role in planning for our needs into the future and ensuring that national objectives are pursued and achieved in a &ldquo;joined up&rdquo; manner.</P>
        <P>I have signalled my intention, where necessary, to bring forward comprehensive new legislation to give effect to those OECD recommendations that will involve legislative change. I view the OECD recommendations as a framework which will ensure that higher education institutions have the capacity to help Ireland&rsquo;s transition to the knowledge society and I have also made it quite clear that the final shape of future policy proposals for the sector will take account of the views of those working in and with it. To this end, my Department and I have already engaged in an extensive consultation process with stakeholders and I look forward to this dialogue continuing into the future.</P>

	<P>The OECD report referred to by the Deputy examines changes in expenditure since the mid-1990s. It shows that public expenditure on education in Ireland has increased substantially between 1995 and 2002 at all levels, even when allowing for inflation. According to data provided by my Department, per pupil expenditure in Ireland at second level has increased by 16% from &euro;5,845 in 2002 &mdash; constant 2004 prices &mdash; to &euro;6,788 in 2004.</P>
        <P>Increased national income and public expenditure has enabled us to reduce average class size over time as well as increase expenditure on salaries and other areas of current expenditure. In the case of the student-teacher ratio, the figure for Ireland at second-level has fallen to 13.6 in 2003-04, which is in line with the international average.</P>
        <P>In recent years, second level schools have benefited from substantial increases in direct funding. The standard capitation grant, which is the main source of funding towards the running costs of secondary schools, now stands at &euro;286 per pupil from 1 January last. In the case of disadvantaged <Col N="982"/>schools, an additional per capita grant of &euro;38 is paid, bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant to &euro;324.</P>
        <P>Introduced with effect from the 2000-01 school year, the <i>per capita</i> grant paid under the school services support initiative for secondary schools now stands at &euro;145 per pupil from January last. This increased grant is paid in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 &mdash;&euro;44.44 per pupil &mdash; per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools. A secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to &euro;255,761 &mdash;&euro;275,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools &mdash; towards general expenses and support services. These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>To date in 2005 my Department has spent a total of approximately &euro;907,000 on legal costs and settlements associated with court cases relating to educational provision for children with special needs compared to a total of approximately &euro;10.13 million in 2003 and 2004. These figures do not include the costs of the State&rsquo;s legal defence which is borne by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. It is the case that legal costs associated with such cases may take some time to be submitted and processed and it is possible that further costs will be incurred before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I stress there has been enormous progress made in recent years in increasing the number of teachers and other supports in our schools which are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our schools working directly <Col N="983"/>with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. At second level, there are approximately 1,600 whole time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in the 1997-98 school year for such pupils. Furthermore there are approximately 6,300 whole time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to the issue of resources at school level, the National Council for Special Education has also been established. This council has approximately 100 staff, the great majority of whom are special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who are locally based throughout the country. The role of the SENOs is to ensure that all special educational needs in their areas are addressed in an effective manner.</P>
        <P>In particular, the SENOs are a focal point of contact for parents/guardians and schools, and process applications for resources for children with special educational needs. I am satisfied that the establishment of the Council and the work of the SENOs is transforming the delivery of special educational services in this country.</P>
        <P>I am confident that as a State we have faced up to the issue of providing appropriate educational provision for all children with special needs and that much work has been done to ensure that the necessary resources and structures are in place. I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>The number of concessionary pupils currently being carried on school transport is 6,557. This figure may fluctuate from time to time. The numbers carried at the end of September 2004 was 6,900.</P>
        <P>On concessionary pupils, I should clarify that a pupil at primary level is eligible for school transport if s/he resides 3.2 kilometres &mdash; two miles &mdash; or more from the nearest suitable primary school. At post-primary level, a pupil is eligible if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres &mdash; three miles &mdash; or more from the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they live.</P>
        <P>In the case of primary and post-primary pupils who are ineligible for school transport on the basis of the distance requirements, transport may be offered on a concessionary fare-paying basis. Such pupils are not guaranteed school transport for every year of their schooling. Rather, the granting of such concessionary transport is dependent on the availability of additional capacity on the buses used to transport eligible students. Any such additional capacity is calculated on a year-to-year basis.</P>

	<P>Modern European languages are currently taught in 394, or 12%, of our primary schools as part of an initiative that was introduced by my Department in September 1998. The aims of this initiative include the development of communication skills in a modern European language, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in our schools. In the participating schools, the pupils in fifth and sixth classes are taught one of four languages, French, German, Italian and Spanish. A dedicated support structure for the teachers in the schools concerned has been in place since the initiative was implemented.</P><Col N="985"/>
        <P>At the request of my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, carried out a study on the feasibility of modern languages in the primary curriculum. It reported to the Minister in spring 2004 and its recommendation, that any decision on the place of modern languages in the primary curriculum should be deferred until the revised primary school curriculum has been implemented in full, was accepted. This will be 2007 at the earliest. In the interim, the NCCA is engaging in additional research and a number of pilot projects with schools participating in the initiative to further inform its final advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is working closely with language experts from the Council of Europe on an analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary level, with a view to the formulation of an integrated language policy. The outcomes of this process, together with the NCCA&rsquo;s advice, will be key considerations in planning the future of modern language provision at primary level.</P>
        <P>In any comparison with other European countries around the provision of modern foreign languages in school curricula, it is important to note that all students in our schools are already required to study our two official languages, Irish and English.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent data on class size available to my Department shows that, in the 2004-05 school year, of the 322 ordinary classes in primary schools in Cavan, 44 classes had 30 or more pupils and of the 266 ordinary classes in primary schools in Monaghan, 40 classes had 30 or more pupils.</P>
        <P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 4,500 additional teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. The annual estimated value of the additional expenditure on these posts is over &euro;200 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1996-97, the average class size in our primary schools was 27. It is now 24. In 1996-97 there was one teacher for every 22 children in our primary schools. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State. The Deputy will be happy to know that the average class size in both Cavan and Monaghan was below the provisional national average in 2004-05 at 22.9 in Cavan and 23.2 in Monaghan.</P>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>While there is more to be done to reduce class sizes further, it should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years. While the average class size nationally has been brought down to 24, I am committed, in line with Government policy, to delivering further reductions in class sizes for the under-nines. In achieving the Government target on smaller class sizes, priority must, in the first instance, be given to children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas. Under the new action plan for tackling education disadvantage which I launched last May, more children in disadvantaged schools will be in classes of 20 in the current school year.</P>
        <P>On the number of classes of over 30 in our schools, the Deputy should be aware that the general rule is that schools are staffed on the basis of having a maximum class size across the school of 29. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use <Col N="987"/>their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has drawn attention to the provision of support for weaker pupils. While the primary responsibility for all pupils rests with class teachers, the Deputy will be aware that additional teaching and special needs assistant supports are made available to schools to cater for pupils with learning support, special educational and special care needs.</P>
        <P>A general allocation scheme has been introduced under which schools have been provided with learning support/resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with learning support needs and those with high incidence special educational needs such as dyslexia.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.</P>

	<P>The purchase of new school sites is underpinned by a thorough assessment of the need for new educational facilities at primary and post-primary level in any given area.</P>
        <P>In general, where the need for a new school site has been identified, the property management section of the Office of Public Works acquires the site on behalf of my Department. The process of site acquisitions takes account of all relevant factors, including public procurement procedures. My Department&rsquo;s policy on site acquisitions is to treat them with the strictest confidentiality until the acquisition has been completed. This is to ensure that my Department will achieve best value for money.</P>
        <P>As part of the site acquisition process, my Department also monitors county development plans and area action plans and meets with local authorities as required to establish the location, <Col N="988"/>scale and pace of major housing developments. An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of such developments in the capacity of existing schools and, where appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. Such reservations may ultimately result in the acquisition of the site and the development of a school or schools.</P>
        <P>While it would be fair to say that the cost of sites impacts on the overall capital envelope available for school buildings it is important to note that the question of acquiring suitable land <i>per se</i> rarely in practice retards the delivery of a school building project in a rapidly developing area.</P>
        <P>There is of course an issue as to whether my Department ends up paying a fair and reasonable price for school sites and what contribution, if any, a developer should make. The Deputy will be aware that provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 do not place any onus on developers to provide school sites other than at market rates. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and I are considering whether legislative change might be of assistance or prove the best way forward here. I would remind the House that any changes in this area would require careful consideration in the context of constitutional protection for private property and indeed in weighing up how any reduction in the price per acre of any land given for schools development might impact on the unit costs and affordability of houses developed on the remaining lands.</P>

	<P>My Department has conducted a rolling review, evaluation and monitoring process of the first school bundle PPP project from project delivery through the first three years of the operation phase. This process involves regular meetings with the school principals both as a group and individually, regular meetings with Jarvis personnel and detailed review of the monthly reports for each school provided by the operator as provided for under the project agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition, an interim evaluation report on the operation of the schools post occupancy is at present being undertaken on each of the five schools. This covers the operation of the contract on the ground and any issues of concern that have arisen. In terms of educational impact the schools will be examined as part of the programme of whole school evaluation, WSE.</P>
        <P>An initial value for money audit of the project was undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This report was undertaken with the full co-operation and participation of my Department and is a welcome addition to the overall knowledge base on PPPs. The report by the Comptroller and Auditor General covered the pilot bundle of five schools from inception, through contract negotiation to completion of construction, but not the operation phase. His work has already informed the revision of the Department of Finance guidelines for future PPP procurement. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance has decided that the NDFA will establish a centre of expertise and procure the next phase of school projects to be delivered by PPP.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to recognise that the PPP contract covers a 25-year period and that by definition an all encompassing value for money test over the full life cycle of the buildings can ultimately be carried out only with the passage of time. The Comptroller and Auditor General recognised this in his report on the project when he stated that &ldquo;ultimately, the full value for money represented by the grouped school project will be determined over the 25-year life cycle of the project&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding for physical education halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the schools&rsquo; capital investment programme.</P>
        <P>General purpose rooms at primary level and PE halls at post-primary level are considered an integral part of the design stage for any major refurbishment programme of existing school buildings, providing that the site is of sufficient size or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built.</P>
        <P>Applications for the provision of PE or sports facilities in existing schools are considered in the context of all other applications on hand for capital investment, that is, applications for new schools, refurbishment projects, extensions, new sites, remediation programmes etc. These facilities are available to all pupils, boys and girls.</P>
        <P>The primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the curriculum. In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.</P>
        <P>However, I recognise that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community. To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities earlier this year urging trustees and boards of management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes. Decisions in the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.</P>
        <P>My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal area whereby the council provides additional funding for larger GP rooms which are then made available as community resources outside school hours. The Department&rsquo;s position is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding, that is, adequate to cover the heat-light-caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use. Of utmost importance, schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school&rsquo;s insurance policy would cover non-school <Col N="991"/>activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Irish language training needs of staff in the Department of the Taoiseach are predominantly met by the Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, which provides Irish courses for the public service, Gaeleagras na Seirbh&iacute;se Poibl&iacute;, the costs of which are met from the central budget.</P>
        <P>A number of staff have participated and continue to participate in a Gaeleagras scholarship scheme. In addition, one staff member participated in a diploma in applied Irish, Diopl&oacute;ma sa Ghaeilge Fheidhmeach, which was run by the department of modern Irish in UCD. The Department of the Taoiseach refund of fees scheme covered the cost of this programme of study which was &euro;700.</P>
        <P>In addition, there were costs associated with updating the design of the Department&rsquo;s website <Col N="994"/>in 2003. As the redesign involved both Irish and English versions of the websites, it is not possible to extract the cost for the redesign of the Irish version only.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, section 11 of the Official Languages Act provides for preparation by my Department, among others, of a scheme of delivery of our services to the general public in the Irish language. In light of this, we have published a scheme with a commencement date of 1 September 2005 to ensure a higher standard and a better availability of our services through Irish. I do not expect that this scheme will give rise to significant additional costs in the future.</P>

The latest estimate, which is at a regional level, is from the June 2003 farm structure survey. This indicates that there were 21,800 farms in the south-west region in June 2003.</P>

I propose to enter into discussions with party leaders shortly on how these matters may be progressed.</P><Col N="996"/>
        <P>In the meantime, the military parade by the Defence Forces, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, commemorating the 1916 Rising, traditionally organised to take place each Easter at the GPO but in abeyance since 1971, will be restored to the annual calendar. I expect that this parade will reflect the evolved role of the Defence Forces and include significant representation of their peacekeeping service abroad with the United Nations.</P>

In many instances, the members are nominated through relevant nominating panels. NESC and NESF, for example, comprise representatives of the various pillars involved in social partnership, namely, employer bodies, trade unions, farming organisations and community and voluntary organisations.</P>

My Department does not directly fund or co-ordinate health and personal social services to victims of abuse. Moneys are made available each year, formerly through the health boards, and now through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to women victims of violence. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in funding so that now over &euro;12 million is provided annually for the provision of such services. The distribution of this funding is a matter for the Health Service Executive. The T&aacute;naiste asked the HSE to carry out an analysis of the current level of service provision in this area and to report back to her. The T&aacute;naiste awaits this report with interest and will be further informed by its findings.</P>

In relation to Dundalk, I met a group proposing to develop a private hospital in Dundalk in May 2005. Officials in my Department met the group in July 2003. I recently made a policy direction to the board of the Health Service Executive in relation to private hospital developments that would free up new public beds.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 237 together.</P>
        <P>The manner in which persons or agencies provide information about pregnancy termination services outside the State is regulated by the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995. This Act permits the provision of abortion information to a pregnant woman only in the context of full counselling as to all available options and without any advocacy of abortion.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency that Positive Options, an information campaign, seeks to empower women to make an informed decision to deal with their crisis pregnancy by informing them, in a neutral way, of the support services available. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has advised me that it has received legal advice that the contents of Positive Options comply with the terms of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive, in discharging its duty of care to long-stay patients, operates a patient private property account system to manage the private money of long-stay patients. The administration of these accounts is a service offered to patients on admission to long-stay care and is a service expected of the health service. The executive in September of this year established a multidisciplinary working group on patient private property accounts. The working group was established to ensure that the administration of these accounts meets all legal and regulatory requirements; operates in the best interests of patients in as responsive a way as practical; takes appropriate account of the input of patients, relatives and friends in so far as is practical; is consistent with best practice in terms of financial controls, transparent accountability and corporate governance arrangements; and is efficient and represents value for money in the use of staff and HSE resources.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 259 together.</P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for the administration of civil registration in Ireland, which includes the provision for facilities for genealogical or family research, rests with an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar-General. His office, Oifig an Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheora, the General Register Office, GRO, is the central repository for all records relating to the civil registration of births, deaths, marriages, domestic adoptions and stillbirths in the State.</P>
        <P>The modernisation programme for civil registration includes the capture and storage in electronic format of all historical paper-based records from 1845, when civil registration was first introduced in Ireland. Civil registration initially applied to non-Roman Catholic marriages only and was extended in 1864 to include births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages. Thus far, birth records from 1864 to date, death records from 1924 to date and marriage records from 1920 to date are available on a live computer system. The remainder of the data &mdash; death records from 1864 to 1923 and marriage records from 1845 to 1919 &mdash; have been captured electronically but a substantial amount of data cleaning and conversion work is required before it can be released to the computer system.</P>
        <P>I have made inquiries of an tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir regarding the matters raised by the Deputy and he advises me that the number of persons who avail of the genealogical or family research facility maintained by him in Dublin varies from year to year but that the number, on average, is in the order of 15,000 persons per annum.</P>
        <P>Searches of GRO records involves accessing index books to records of births, deaths and marriages; searching these indices to identify specific entries in the records; and, if required, purchasing either photocopies or certified copies of the identified entries in the records. This facility is also available at superintendent registrars&rsquo; offices in respect of events registered within their districts.</P>
        <P>The head office of the GRO relocated from Dublin to Roscommon in April of this year, a move which was in line with Government policy on the decentralisation of Government offices. Accommodation provided at GRO, Roscommon, includes accommodation for a genealogical or family research facility which will be commissioned on completion of a major project to create, as part of the modernisation programme, an electronic database of the index books to the records of births, deaths and marriages maintained in the research facility at GRO, Dublin.</P>
        <P>From a research perspective, the creation of an electronic database of indices will facilitate easier and more efficient record searches. It will also facilitate the extension of the availability of the <Col N="1012"/>indices beyond the single physical repository at GRO, Dublin, to the research facility at GRO, Roscommon, and the various HSE registration offices nationwide where civil registration is carried out. It is also the intention that the database will be extended in due course to facilitate on-line research. Planning for these developments is under way and I am satisfied that substantial benefits from its implementation in due course will accrue to professional genealogists and private individuals alike.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 280 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme, LTI. The LTI does not cover general practitioner fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are mental handicap; mental illness &mdash; for people under 16 only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism; conditions arising from thalidomide; and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>The medical card and drugs payment schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the LTI can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. In November 2004 I announced that from 1 January 2005 income guidelines to be used for assessments of full eligibility to medical cards would be increased by 7.5% with the objective of issuing an additional 30,000 medical cards. At that time, I also <Col N="1014"/>announced my intention to introduce 200,000 GP visit cards which would allow the holders of these cards to receive general practitioner services free of charge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June I simplified the means test for medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. On 13 October 2005, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than this time last year.</P>

The task force, chaired by Dr. Brian Maurer, will make recommendations on the prevention of sudden cardiac death and on the detection of those at high risk. It will also advise on equipment and training programmes to improve the outcome in those suffering from sudden cardiac collapse and on the establishment of appropriate surveillance systems.</P>
        <P>I understand that the task force has been involved in widespread consultation with individuals and organisations and that a report will be published shortly.

Comprehensive data for 2005 are not yet available. The HIPE system shows that in 2004 1,546,235 inpatient procedures were carried out. This figure covers all inpatient procedures including minor diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. More than one procedure may be carried out per hospital stay.</P>

	<P>Separate national base prices for surgery only cases are not produced as all patient types, surgical, medical and other, are encompassed within the national case mix programme. <Col N="1026"/>The present case mix classification system categorises patients into 665 surgical, medical and other diagnosis related groups, or DRGs. What is termed the case mix adjusted base price for inpatients and day cases is the average cost of a case nationally when all national data, collected in the 37 hospitals that participate in the programme, for all 665 DRGs, surgical, medical and other, have been aggregated for all patients in the programme. This is the cost of treating a standard case with a complexity of one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Data regarding 2003 activity and costs are &euro;540 and &euro;3,644 respectively. These figures have already been released to the Deputy. Data regarding 2004 are being audited, as part of the annual case mix budget adjustments which will form part of the 2006 financial allocations, and will be available in early January.</P>

	<P>Employment information is collected by my Department every quarter on the basis of grade and employing agency and does not include any data on a programme by programme basis as requested by the Deputy. However, employment growth in each of the grade categories of health service staff on the basis of employing authority that is, the Health Service Executive, intellectual disability services and vol<Col N="1027"/>untary hospitals, is as set out in the following table for the period requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The latest available data are in respect of the end of June 2005. Between 1997 and that date, there was an increase in the level of employment of 33,093, or 48.78%, excluding home helps, in whole-time equivalent terms. In this context, comparing employment levels in June 2005 with those in December 1997, there were 43.89%, or 2,177 more medical and dental personnel,<?oasys _jy?>127.8%, or 7,588 more health and social care professionals and 27.6%, or 7,545 more nurses employed in the health services in whole-time equivalent terms. Caution should be exercised in comparing employment growth between grade categories, however, owing to some changes in their composition over the period. Almost two thirds of health services personnel formally classified as management or administrative are involved in direct service provision to the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied that the Health Service Executive materials are not misleading. For instance, the public poster, Anyone can catch the flu!, clearly states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Over 65s and younger people with chronic diseases are especially vulnerable. The vaccine is free to these groups. GPs charge a consultation fee to those without a medical card.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The leaflet with frequently asked questions states that the vaccine is free to all persons over 65 and those in the younger "at risk" groups with a chronic disease and that family doctors charge a consultation fee to patients not covered by a medical card.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This information is correct. As stated in my reply to Question No. 280 of 2 November 2005, the influenza vaccine is available free of charge from general practitioners to medical cardholders who are deemed to be &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of serious illness as a result of contracting the disease. Persons in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; group who do not have a medical card can obtain the vaccine free of charge, however, the fee for administering the vaccine in such cases is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient.</P>

	<P>Applications for GP visit cards are assessed by the Health Service Executive, HSE, with reference to the national income assessment guidelines which I have established in agreement with the executive. The Deputy will be aware that I have made a number of changes to enable a greater number of people, particularly families with children, to qualify for these cards. All persons assessed as qualifying for a GP visit card will be issued with such a card.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%. In June, it was apparent that the effect of rising income in our successful economy meant that the expectation that 30,000 additional medical cards would be issued was unlikely to be fulfilled. At that time I simplified the means test <Col N="1035"/>for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants. On 13 October 2005, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means that income guidelines are now 29% higher than this time last year. My Department and the HSE will actively encourage people to apply for these benefits and continue to monitor the number of cards issued.</P>

The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has confirmed the cost of fabrication of the wooden structure as &euro;7,350.30. Labour and other costs related to this work amounted to &euro;12,115.88. As the timber extension was a temporary measure, the extension and timber baffles have been recovered and may be reused. The work to fit a concrete extension to the denil fish pass and the installation of a second fish pass during summer 2005 were carried out as a single operation. The total costs were as follows:</P>

        <P>The second, groyne, fish pass installed during summer 2005 has been inspected recently following reports of salmon mortalities in its vicinity. The SRFB have informed the OPW that the groyne pass is not operating at optimum capacity during low flows and have identified a requirement for a minor adjustment to the rock armour.</P>
        <P>Since the remediation works were carried out there has been no evidence of a hold up of salmon at Lacken Weir and fish have been seen ascending both the denil pass and the groyne pass. It is regrettable that inaccuracies in recent newspaper reports on the subject in both national <Col N="1041"/>and regional papers may have lead members of the public to believe otherwise. A press statement has been issued to the papers concerned detailing the facts. A copy of this statement is available on request from my office to anybody interested in the facts in this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 and 329 together.</P>
        <P>The office space occupied by public service activities in Dublin which have been designated as early movers is in the region of 90,000 square metres. This comprises State owned space and leased space. The question of which vacated buildings will be disposed of is under consideration. Ultimately, any decisions on disposals will depend on a range of factors, including the following: The particular requirements of the Departments remaining in Dublin; the specific circumstances associated with each building, including location, quality and design, tenure, office area and whether it is leasehold or freehold; the timing of property sales are directly affected by prevailing market conditions; and the timing of the relocation of staff to decentralised offices. The area of space which will be acquired in decentralisation locations will be broadly equivalent to the space being vacated in Dublin. The cost of acquiring sites-properties for the early moving Departments is estimated to be in the region of &euro;47 million, excluding VAT.</P>
        <P>Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on this basis. However, in advance of actual market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large scale, diverse and complex programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Current OPW cost norms in respect of standard office accommodation would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,200 per square metre in suburban-rural locations. Such figures exclude VAT, <Col N="1042"/>professional fees, inflation and site-works. In addition, the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at circa &euro;4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of information and technology and specialised equipment requirements.</P>
        <P>Such general measures of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables, which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. It should be noted that general cost indicators of this type are subject to change over time.</P>

        <Quest>if a copy of the draft management plan for the Great Blasket Island will be laid in the library of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; the members of the Great Blasket management group; the location and extent of rights of way of the Great Blasket Island; if all visitors to the Great Blasket Island have the right to walk such rights of way; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to lay the management plan in the library of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. I will, however, forward a copy to the Deputy for his perusal.</P>
        <P>The membership of the new local management committee has not yet been finalised. Roads and pathways on the island are currently in the ownership of the landowners but it is intended that when the lands are acquired, the Office of <Col N="1043"/>Public Works will be responsible for their maintenance and use by visitors to the island. Overall access to the island will be limited initially to a maximum of 400 visitors per day in the interests of conserving its unique heritage.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy is seeking a breakdown of stamp duty yield, in each of the years referred to, according to the main available stamp duty categories, and furthermore in the case of residential property, a breakdown of yield according to the various stamp duty rates that applied in each year.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information is not available to provide a breakdown of the residential stamp duty yield appropriate to each rate in each year. However, the following table shows the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; net yield from stamp duties by category in each of the years 1998 to 2004 and in the nine month period to the end of September 2005.</P><Col N="1043"/>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the sixth VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. <Col N="1049"/>As the supply of property was not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to this item. In addition, the VAT rate that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the location of the customer. There is no provision in EU VAT law that would allow for the abolition of VAT for first time buyers.</P>
        <P>In regard to the question of providing extra tax relief following the birth of a child, I would remind the Deputy of the long-standing practice of Ministers for Finance not to comment on what may or may not be contained in upcoming budgets. I do not intend to depart from that approach.</P>

	<P>As I pointed out in my replies to recent parliamentary questions tabled by the Deputy on this topic, the estimated figures in respect of employee and employer contributions to occupational pensions are only available in aggregate form on a tentative basis.</P>
        <P>Subject to those limitations, and using some data obtained from the Pensions Board, the estimated cost of &euro;563 million for tax relief on employee contributions in respect of the income tax year 2002, the latest available, was derived by applying an overall average marginal rate of tax to an approximate overall contribution base of &euro;1,942 million.</P>
        <P>As regards employer contributions to employee occupational pension funds, using the estimated level of employee contributions as a basis and making certain assumptions as to both the total amount of employer contributions and the proportion of those contributions made by tax liable companies at the standard rate of corporation tax, which was 16% in 2002, and at the relieved rate of 10%, an approximate overall contribution base of &euro;4,600 million and &euro;623 million cost in tax forgone for 2002 were estimated.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the basis for existing estimated figures of the net income of approved superannuation funds, contributions plus investment income less pension outgoings, is aggregated data estimated on a very tentative basis.</P>
        <P>Using estimates of the value of assets held by Irish pension funds provided by the Irish Association of Pension Funds, making certain assumptions as to the value of both the investment income and pension outgoings of superannuation funds and also taking into account the available estimates for employee and employer contributions to occupational pensions, the base value of the net income of the funds is estimated at close on &euro;6,360 million. The estimated cost of almost &euro;1,272 million for the cost of tax exemption in 2002 is based on the assumed application of the standard rate of income tax to this base value.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 and 346 together.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the requirements set out in the June 2005 progress report of the decentralisation implementation group each of the organisations not previously identified as &ldquo;early mover&rdquo; organisations, including the organisation to which the Deputy refers, are now in the process of preparing a deeper iteration of their original decentralisation implementation plans. This more detailed plan will include a financial assessment of the transition costs that can be expected to arise during the decentralisation process in respect of knowledge retention and training as well as possible promotion and recruitment. Once completed the plan will be available for examination by that organisation&rsquo;s internal audit committee and will also be assessed by the decentralisation implementation group.</P>
        <P>A number of options will be explored by the organisation in question in order to effectively manage these potential transition costs and these may include: drawing on capacity from within the organisation which ordinarily would have been available to do other projects and activities; streamlining the provision of other services to release resources to support decentralisation; use of temporary resources; use of overtime; alteration of timescales in other areas; and use of external resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Finance by virtue of having overall responsibility for the management of the public finances, has responsibility for managing the allocation of resources as approved by Government at a global level and putting in place a policy framework for securing value for money by line Departments and their implementing agencies in the delivery of public services. Primary responsibility for managing programmes, projects and services and securing value for money from them within that budgetary and policy framework rests with line Departments and their implementing agencies.</P>
        <P>On foot of its value for money policy framework role, the Department of Finance has set out general guidance and rules across a range of areas to assist Departments and implementing agen<Col N="1058"/>cies. These include rules and guidance in public procurement, public private partnerships, and appraisal and management of capital programmes. The Department of Finance has also overseen a number of reforms designed to assist the better management of programmes and projects. These include three-year administrative budget agreements and a five-year capital investment framework, extended to ten years in the case of the recently launched Transport 21 programme.</P>
        <P>Building on initiatives already in place, the Government recently announced an initiative on management of ICT projects and consultancies. On 20 October 2005 I also announced the introduction of additional measures to secure better value for money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The management of ICT projects and consultancy initiative provides, among other things, for: the immediate introduction of a peer review process for major ICT projects; Ministers reviewing in the context of the 2006 Estimates the financial provisions for consultancy and their Departments confirming that the expenditure is necessary and the Department of Finance&rsquo;s guidelines in this regard are being applied; and a review by the Department of Finance of existing guidelines for the engagement of consultants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The additional measures for better value for money which I announced on 20 October provide for: full acceptance of the need to improve value for money and to ensure that every euro is well spent; fixed price lump-sum contracts becoming the norm for public contracts; <i>ex ante</i> evaluations, including economic cost-benefit appraisal, for all projects above &euro;30 million; for large projects over &euro;30 million, there will be formalised contracts review by the Departments concerned with reports to their Ministers and with provision for audit by the Department of Finance; there should be no extension of large service contracts without tendering if the extension is more than 50% of the original contract or exceeds &euro;250,000, whichever is the lower; more vigorous competition for public sector contracts; additional specialised training for the Civil Service and State agencies; open recruitment of a number of full-time specialists to the public sector on IT procurement and capital project evaluation and management; secondment of IT procurement specialists between the public and private sectors; allocation of single individual responsibility for all major IT and capital projects; better use of compulsory purchase orders; and performance table for Departments and State agencies regarding the extent of project outcomes versus budgets on contracts.</P>
        <P>I am determined that these initiatives will be fully implemented in Departments and implementing agencies and I have instructed the Department of Finance to engage with other Departments accordingly.</P>

However, should the Deputy wish to provide any additional information, the Revenue Commissioners will arrange, if necessary, for a further search to be undertaken.

        <P>The framework for public private partnerships, agreed with the relevant social partners under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in 2001, provided for the central PPP policy unit in the Department of Finance to lead a communications and awareness strategy. Key actions under the strategy, which was agreed with the relevant social partners in 2002, included a series of nationwide seminars involving the social partners. Seminars were held in Cork, Waterford, Athlone, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and Dublin between December 2001 and June 2003. The purpose of the seminars was to inform business, union and local government interests and the public about the framework for public private partnerships and about the PPP process generally. Direct <Col N="1060"/>expenditure associated with these public presentations amounted to &euro;36,578.73 between 2001 and 2003.</P>
        <P>In addition to these seminars, there were individual seminars for the construction industry, chambers of commerce, local authorities, etc. It was not possible in the time available to compile all the information including costs sought by the Deputy.

        <Quest>the number of farmers who have benefited to date from the decision in budget 2005 to allow relief on stamp duty where farmers swapped land to consolidate their farm holdings; his views on whether the proposed structure is too limited and should be available to any farmer who can prove that he has sold off an out-farm to buy an adjac<Col N="1061"/>ent holding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, in the 2005 budget I announced a special one-off stamp duty relief relating to an exchange of farm land between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer&rsquo;s holding. This new relief means that no stamp duty will be charged on an exchange of such lands where the lands are of equal value. In a case where the lands exchanged are not of equal value, stamp duty will only be charged on the amount of the difference in the value of the lands concerned. The details are contained in section 121 of the Finance Act 2005. The scheme began on 1 July 2005.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Department of Agriculture and Food that Teagasc has indicated that farm consolidations certificates are currently being processed for 12 individuals, six sets, but since it began on 1 July 2005 they have had queries from 70 people with potential to benefit from the existing scheme. I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the scheme was only recently introduced, the numbers of claims in respect of the relief received to date by them have been insignificant. </P>

        <Quest>his views on whether the current flat rate VAT refund of 4.8% is an adequate refund to farmers in view of the drop in product prices resulting from the decoupling and the continuing increase in the cost of farm inputs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the calculation of the farmers&rsquo; flat rate is governed by EU VAT law and is based on the relevant macro-economic data for the farming sector for the preceding three years. The purpose of the flat rate addition is to compensate unregistered farmers for VAT which they incur on their business inputs. The flat rate addition is not there to provide any form of income support to farmers or to compensate for increases in wages or costs generally.</P>
        <P>The flat rate refund for unregistered farmers is examined every year in the lead up to the budget. It is not customary for me to comment on any <Col N="1062"/>possible changes to the existing rate which may arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>Policy in respect of the promotion or development of biofuels is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I acknowledge that tax can play a role in the promotion of biofuels and in this regard the Deputy is aware that there is the current duty exemption scheme for pilot projects in the biofuels area. The number of applications made for relief from excise duty under the pilot scheme clearly indicates that there is a strong interest in developing a biofuels industry in Ireland. As the Deputy is aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the budget on possible budget decisions.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to allegations made about illegal fishing. When this matter was brought to <Col N="1064"/>my attention, I arranged to have the matter formally referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a request for an investigation.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting an investigation into the matter. That investigation is solely a matter for the Garda and I have no role in it. As the timeframe and conduct of the investigation are matters solely for the Garda, I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further or make a statement on the matter.</P>

	<P>The number of vessels licensed to carry passengers to the Great Blasket Island from Dingle and from D&uacute;n Chaoin is as shown in the following table. There are a total of 25 vessels, both passenger ships and passenger boats. My Department has no involvement with the arrangements and schedules that exist for ferrying passengers to and from the island, nor does it have details of the actual numbers carried by each vessel.</P>
        <P>All of the vessels listed in table A are class VI passenger ships and are only permitted to operate during daylight, in summer, in fine weather and within defined distances and-or specific geographic limits. Certificates for all class VI passenger ships are issued annually in accordance with the relevant Merchant Shipping Acts and cover the period from 1 April until 31 October each year. The maximum number of passengers that each vessel is permitted to carry is also shown in <Col N="1065"/>table A and is specified on its passenger certificate.</P>
        <P>All of the vessels listed in table B hold a valid passenger boat licence in accordance with the relevant Merchant Shipping Acts. The maximum number of passengers that any passenger boat may carry is twelve or such lesser number as is <Col N="1066"/>specified in the licence. The particular number for each individual boat is determined following a survey by my Department. Generally passenger boats are issued with a two-year licence and are not subject to seasonal restrictions like class VI ships but operate within defined distances and or specific geographic limits. </P><Col N="1065"/>

	<P>In phase 1 of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, programme, 19 networks were completed and handed over to e-Net, the company that holds the services concession contract to manage, maintain <Col N="1066"/>and market the MANs. A further seven MANs are nearing completion.</P>
        <P>In phase 2 of the MANs programme, 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above have been identified as lacking an adequate broadband provision by the private sector, and MANs will be built in each of these in association with the local and regional authorities during 2006 and 2007. Detailed discussions are currently under way with the planning and engineering divisions of the local authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department continually reviews all aspects of the MANs programme, including the provision of backhaul for the MANs.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers which will take place in December and decide on the total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas and associated conditions for fish stocks for 2006.</P>
        <P>The priority for Ireland at this Council will be to achieve a balanced outcome that will provide for a sustainable future for the Irish fishing industry. The need to take effective conservation measures in order that fish stocks are managed and exploited on a sustainable basis is an over-riding imperative for both the Government and the Irish fishing industry. Within that context, the primary aim will be to ensure that Irish fishermen all around the coast will have available to them the maximum possible quantity and range of fishing possibilities in 2006 that can be justified on a sustainable basis.</P>
        <P>In so far as Ireland is concerned, this means the setting of catch limits for Irish fishermen in respect of some 40 fish stocks, mainly in western waters around Ireland&rsquo;s coast, as well as effort limitation measures for certain gears in certain waters.</P>
        <P>The European Commission will come forward with a proposal for 2006 in the next few weeks which will take into account the scientific advice recently given by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES. I will maintain close contact with industry representatives throughout these negotiations with regard to securing sustainable fishing opportunities for Irish fishermen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of telecommunications, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications regulation, ComReg. Those companies compete with each other for business, <Col N="1068"/>and promote their products by way of advertising, special offers, etc.</P>
        <P>In addition the Government believes that access to ICT is an essential enabler of economic growth and social inclusion, and a number of initiatives are being pursued that are pushing the broadband agenda, including the metropolitan area networks, the broadband for schools project and the county and group broadband schemes, which are helping to bring broadband connectivity to all regions, and helping to encourage a far greater interest in broadband usage.</P>
        <P>Following the success of the Intel computer clubhouses in Dublin&rsquo;s Liberties and Blanchardstown, which are aimed primarily at young school leavers aged ten to 18 who have not completed the senior cycle, funding has been made available from the e-inclusion fund for a pilot mobile computer clubhouse project. The 24-week pilot project, which is being overseen by my Department, uses two vehicles that have been specially adapted for use as mobile computer classrooms. A programme of visits is being set out, in association with local community groups, voluntary bodies and area partnerships, to bring the mobile computer clubhouses to areas that have been identified as having a lower level of computer and internet penetration. Considerable interest is being shown in the project, and it is hoped that further funding can be sourced to enable the project to be extended.</P>
        <P>The mobile computer clubhouse will serve the needs of persons of all age groups who desire access to broadband and computing, but who lack the means to access it. The pilot scheme is being used to determine the areas of greatest need, and to develop a curriculum that best serves those needs. My Department is also developing an advertising campaign that will advise and inform the public on broadband usage and ICT generally.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he is taking to improve port infrastructure here and if sufficient port capacity will be available from 2007.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>In January 2005, I launched the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, <Col N="1069"/>planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
        <P>As an initial step in this process, the Department consulted with the commercial ports handling unitised trade to determine their view of port capacity and how they intended to deal with the projected capacity requirement. In addition, the Department recently appointed Fisher Associates to, <i>inter alia,</i> advise on evaluating the projects submitted by the commercial ports with a view to the Department&rsquo;s recommendations to Government.</P>
        <P>As an initial step in their assignment, I understand that Fisher Associates is currently consulting with ports and other key stakeholders with regard to the criteria to be used for project evaluation.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this process is to satisfy the Government that the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the key pro<Col N="1070"/>jects referred to above, which have been the subject of an independent and expert evaluation.</P>
        <P>The Government expects that the market itself should decide which projects or combination of projects are completed. Direct Government intervention would only arise if the market were found wanting in that regard and some level of State aid was considered essential in order to meet the national capacity requirement.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Members of the internal audit unit attend audit committee meetings to give detailed background information that is requested from time to time by the members of the committee on various issues. The audit committee has met on four occasions so far in 2005, on Thursday, 3 March; on Monday, 30 May; on Thursday, 23 June; and on Thursday, 13 October. It is expected that the committee will meet once more before the end of the year, on 2 December next.</P>
        <P>The agenda for the departmental audit committee meeting held on Thursday, 3 March at 2.30 p.m. was (1) the adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting and any matters arising; (2) a presentation by the assistant secretary, Dr. Cecil Beamish; (3) risk assessment; (4) the draft audit plan for 2005; (5) the implementation of the Mullarkey report; (6) the presentation of the training audit and audit of carryover scheme reports for discussion; and (7) any other business &mdash; the network for internal auditors in State sponsored bodies.</P>

        <P>I will now set out the charter, terms of reference and role of the audit committee of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The audit committee is part of the ongoing systematic review of the Department&rsquo;s business control and corporate governance procedures. It considers the adequacy of the control framework within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and organisations under its aegis. The role of the audit committee is to advise on matters relating to the operations and development of the internal audit function; to ensure that the annual audit plan complies with the stated role of internal audit in respect of national and EU funding, to oversee the business control and risk management environment, and to advise on the relationship with external audit and other relevant consultancies. The audit committee is not responsible for any executive function and is not vested with any executive powers. The audit committee consists of a chair and not less than four ordinary members who are appointed by the Secretary General by virtue of their experience in fields of expertise relevant to the committee&rsquo;s functions. Appointments to the committee are normally, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary General, for a period of three years and do not exceed a period of five years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The duties of the audit committee are to consider the draft annual internal audit plan; to monitor the implementation of the plan; to protect the independence of the Department&rsquo;s internal audit function; to review the significant findings and recommendations of the internal audit unit; to monitor the action taken by management to resolve any issues which are identified; to monitor the performance of the Department&rsquo;s internal audit function; to approve a charter for internal audit that clearly defines its mission, authority, roles, responsibilities and other reporting relationships; to ask for special reports from the internal audit function as considered appropriate; to advise and make recom<Col N="1073"/>mendations to the Secretary General and the management committee on matters pertaining to the Department&rsquo;s internal audit function that the committee considers necessary or appropriate including its effectiveness, organisation, resources, training and use of technology; to communicate with the Secretary General and the management committee on any significant shortfalls in the business control and-or risk management environments which come to the attention of and are of concern to the audit committee; to consider the findings and comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report on the appropriation account and his other reports; to consider and where appropriate advise on the procedures and policies used in the preparation of the annual appropriation account; to consider any reports from the European Court of Auditors or the European Commission about co-financed expenditures within the Department; and to review any value-for-money reports which are undertaken by the internal audit division or any other division in the Department.</P>
        <P>Not less than four meetings of the audit committee take place in each calendar year. A quorum of five members, with no less than two external members, is required for each meeting. If a vote is required on any issue, a simple majority of all the members present, including the chair, will carry the motion, with the chair having a casting vote in the event of a tie. The head of internal audit and such other officials from the Department as the committee may require shall attend committee meetings. The minutes of the meetings shall be approved by the chair and circulated as early as possible after the meeting to members of the audit committee and the Secretary General. Within three months of the end of each calendar year, the committee formally reports in writing to the Secretary General, outlining its activities during the year and such advice and recommendations as it may deem appropriate. The committee exercises an advisory role in relation to its duties and functions within the Department.</P>
        <P>The audit committee may, following agreement with the Department, obtain outside legal or other independent professional advice and secure the attendance at committee meetings of outside interests with relevant experience and expertise, if it considers it necessary. The committee is independent in the performance of its duties. The committee and its members are not subject to the direction of any person in the performance of their duties. The members of the committee are fully briefed and kept up to date on any significant matters relating to their role and duties. The committee has the right of access to the Secretary General. The charter may be amended or updated in joint consultation between the Secretary General and the committee.</P>

	<P>The Department has conducted a preliminary assessment of the possible costs associated with decentralisation, in terms of one-off costs over the period of relocation and ongoing annual costs after relocation. Further comprehensive analysis is under way to underpin fully quantified estimates of the costs. The Deputy also asked about the cost of implementing strategies to address the issues raised by decentralisation. The Department&rsquo;s knowledge management initiative, ICT strategy and training and development strategies predate the decentralisation programme. Those initiatives, which have been synchronised with the decentralisation programme as major planks of the Department&rsquo;s risk mitigation plans, have not yet resulted in material additional expenditure over and above that already planned for the initiatives. Transfer activity to fill posts for all three decentralisation locations is under way. While recruitment costs are matters for the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Finance in the first instance, I advise the Deputy that no recruitment need has yet been identified in the context of decentralisation and no similar promotion requirement has been identified to date.</P>

	<P>As part of its normal business, the Department&rsquo;s audit committee reviews the risk assessment and mitigation <Col N="1075"/>strategies across the entire Department, including the risks associated with decentralisation. The committee, at a meeting in June 2004, considered that the decentralisation process was potentially the most serious risk identified to date, because of the potential loss of corporate knowledge to the Department. The committee advised that the risk would have to be managed carefully. Subsequent to that meeting, the Department presented its decentralisation plan, which highlights the major risks and mitigating strategies associated with decentralisation.</P>

	<P>While an abundance of salmon continues to return to Irish rivers, the Government has accepted the scientific advice that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. Therefore, the Government&rsquo;s policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when I set the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to align fully the exploitation of salmon at national and district levels with the scientific advice by 2007. To that end, I have asked the National Salmon Commission to advise on how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007, bearing in mind the requirement to ensure the future biological viability of the salmon resource in all catchments and the needs of all stakeholders, including those who derive their living from the wild salmon resource. I assure the Deputy that I will examine carefully all recommendations in this regard, including those relevant to drift netting within the Irish fishery, made by the National Salmon Commission.</P>

	<P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, which was established as <Col N="1076"/>a statutory agency in May 2002, implements initiatives on renewable energy, including research, on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The agency&rsquo;s renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme aims to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy technologies which are close to market and to assess and develop potentially successful technologies. The programme provides support for renewable energy product renewable energy research, development and demonstration, market demonstration of new technologies, resource studies and public good research activities.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;ocean energy&rdquo; is generally used to refer to energy from wave energy and tidal energy resources. When considering tidal energy, two categories of tide driven hydro power are available. The first type of device is referred to as a tidal barrage, whereby the tidal water is stored behind a dam and released as the tide height reduces similar to a hydroelectric power plant. This form of tidal power requires large areas of enclosed water with large tidal variations. Tidal flows into most Irish estuaries or bays do not yield particularly high tidal variations and this form of renewable energy is considered to be an expensive form of renewable energy for Ireland. The second type of tidal power device is referred to as a marine current turbine whereby an underwater device is placed in the path of the tidal current to generate power. This type of technology is currently under development and commercial devices are not yet available.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Marine Institute commissioned a resource study covering the whole island to investigate Ireland&rsquo;s potential to use this technology. The results of the study indicated a considerable tidal energy resource based on the estimated performance of the best technology currently under development. To maximise the use of tidal power, it is important to ensure it can be integrated effectively with the electricity network. Sustainable Energy Ireland is funding a project with UCD and Queens University Belfast to examine the impact the distribution and phasing of tidal power will have on this country&rsquo;s electricity network. Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Marine Institute are working in co-operation to develop ocean energy technology in Ireland. Capital grant funding is available from the agencies for technology developers of wave and tidal energy devices. Funding has been provided to third level research facilities in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy including biofuels. I am committed to the development and promotion of a biofuels sector in Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel market, which will contribute to emissions reductions and overall security of supply. In 2004, the Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels. A scheme under the Act, which was agreed between the Department and the Department of Finance, was launched in April 2005. Some 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date, of which two were in the bioethanol category. The proposals were evaluated by the Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland and recommendations were made to the Minister for Finance. Eight projects were awarded excise relief under the scheme including one bioethanol project. Excise relief of &euro;6 million will be allowed for the projects over the two-year period to 2007. It is anticipated that the project will result in 16 million litres of biofuels replacing imports on the Irish transport market over that period. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.</P>
        <P>Under Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme, capital grant aid is also available for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of almost &euro;250,000 has been awarded to support modifications of the engines of up to 100 vehicles and to provide plant and monitoring equipment. An interdepartmental biofuels group was established in 2004 to consider policy options for the development of the biofuels market and to consider the options from the perspectives of the sectors or interests represented by each Department. It comprises representatives from the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Transport and Agriculture and Food, as well as Sustainable Energy Ireland. As part of its work, the group commissioned a liquid biofuels strategy study for Ireland, which was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland in December 2004. The report examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel. The <Col N="1078"/>number of applications in the pilot scheme clearly indicates the strong interest in developing a biofuels industry in Ireland. I have been in contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for increasing fiscal support for biofuels bearing in mind competitiveness issues in the sector as a whole. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are also being considered in consultation with all the relevant Departments.</P>

	<P>I have previously advised the House that the works carried out on the weir at Lacken Bridge on the River Nore in Kilkenny city were undertaken on behalf of, and are therefore the responsibility of, the Office of Public Works. Earlier this year, I became aware of difficulties arising from the works when I was advised by Deputy McGuinness, who recently gave me some DVD footage, and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board that some salmon encountered difficulties migrating to the spawning grounds during an eight-day period at the start of January 2005 when water levels throughout the catchment area, specifically at Lacken Weir in Kilkenny, were low. I have been assured by the chief executive officer of the board that reports of 1,000 fish dying as a result of the difficulties were grossly exaggerated and that there was no evidence to substantiate such claims. The CEO has advised me that the board&rsquo;s staff, who closely monitored the situation at that time, found evidence of no more than 25 salmon casualties as a result of the difficulties identified at the weir in early 2005. Since then, the board and the engineering division of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, having considered a report provided by Deputy McGuinness, have provided technical expertise to address the problem. I understand from the CEO of the board that his staff, in co-operation with the engineers in the Department and the OPW, worked during low water in the summer months to install remedial measures at the fish pass to ameliorate the situation and to ensure improvement for the passage of fish up the river.</P>
        <P>Despite recent reports that salmon are encountering difficulties passing through Lacken Weir, I understand that the Southern Regional Fisheries Board is satisfied that the remedial works carried out on the fish pass are proving effective in ensuring salmon passage at the weir. The board&rsquo;s chief executive officer has advised me that he has agreed with the OPW to put a camera into the fish pass to monitor the situation more closely and to provide evidence of the number of salmon getting through or otherwise. I understand that the OPW will cover the cost of the camera, which will be installed as soon as weather and river conditions allow. The officials of the Department and the board will consider any further information brought to their attention about the operation of the weir.</P>

	<P>Arrangements for the management of the mackerel quota have been in place for many years. These arrangements set individual catch limits for the 23 vessels in the dedicated pelagic segment of the Irish fleet, which is primarily based in the north west, Killybegs.</P>
        <P>The vessels outside of the pelagic segment have traditionally caught comparatively small amounts of the stock, normally less than 1,000 tonnes. In 1999-2000, new vessels were introduced into the polyvalent segment of the fleet which are particularly suited to catching pelagic species. As a result of this change, the mackerel arrangements were reviewed in 2001 taking into account all of the issues and views expressed by the industry. To reflect the changes in the fleet and to balance the interests of all parties in this fishery, a maximum catch limit of 7,000 tonnes of mackerel quota was set for the vessels in the polyvalent segment of the fleet.</P><Col N="1082"/>
        <P>This represented a significant increase in the mackerel quota available to these vessels which, as the total Irish quota could not be increased, was taken off the quota that previously would have been given to the north west pelagic vessels. Subsequent to this change the national mackerel quota has decreased from approximately 70,000 tonnes to below 50,000 tonnes and, accordingly, the proportionate share available to vessels in the polyvalent segment has increased.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I consider that the current arrangements represent a fair and coherent system and I have no plans to introduce any further changes to them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary responsibility for the development of the post office network rests with An Post. The automation of the network was completed in 1997 and it has only been in very exceptional circumstances, such as an existing automated office closing and its equipment being transferred to a suitable neighbouring location which transacts significant volumes of welfare business, that further offices have been automated since then.</P>
        <P>The current level of automated coverage is considered by An Post to be extremely comprehensive by any objective standard and this level <Col N="1084"/>of coverage makes it difficult to justify on either customer service or economic grounds the extension of automation to all offices, regardless of their location or business volumes. Nevertheless, I have asked An Post to undertake a pilot project to automate a selected number of non-automated offices to gauge the effect on new business. Ten post offices have been automated over the past eight weeks and a marketing campaign is under way in the localities where the pilot projects are being undertaken to support the initiative. An Post will gauge the results of the pilot project and the impact of automation on business will be evaluated following the trial period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the provision of Internet availability to the public, there are no plans by An Post, at this point, to provide this service to the public through the rural post office network. However, with the roll out of e-government services, the automated element of the post office network is ideally placed to capitalise on opportunities arising in this space, especially in the area of e-payments.</P>
        <P>A core objective for An Post continues to be the retention of access to post office services in <Col N="1085"/>as many locations as possible, in the manner which best meets customer needs, whether services are provided via post offices, postal agencies or the PostPoint network.</P>

        <P>While a small number of staff are involved in the management of the decentralisation programme for this Department, no new staff were recruited for this purpose and the salary costs of the staff involved are being borne from within existing resources. Training costs are not expected to be significant as most of the planned formal training courses, including a comprehensive induction programme for new staff, are being provided in-house. Officers who transfer to posts which are decentralising will also be provided with detailed role profiles and will, in most cases, receive some on-the-job training from those already <i>in situ</i>. The extent to which it will be possible to provide overlaps, and therefore the cost of these, is not yet clear.</P>
        <P>Officers currently based in the directorate who decide not to decentralise to Limerick will be redeployed to other divisions or to other Departments or offices, in line with arrangements agreed between the Department of Finance and the unions. No additional costs are expected to arise under this heading. As the number of applications for the administrative positions advertised <Col N="1088"/>for Limerick exceeds the number required, the need to fill any gaps appears very unlikely.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works, OPW, is responsible for the provision of office accommodation for the directorate in Limerick and will bear its rental costs. The Department is working closely with the OPW to identify suitable accommodation in Limerick and it is hoped to select a premises in the very near future. Pending this, it is not possible to estimate the level of costs which the Department will incur in the provision of the information and communications technology infrastructure and in other areas.</P>

	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has published its second implementation plan for the decentralisation of Development Co-operation Ireland to Limerick. This plan includes risk mitigation strategies. The Department&rsquo;s audit committee has discussed the issue of decentralisation and has reviewed the associated risk assessment. In September 2005, the audit committee published its annual report for 2004, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library and this report includes comments on decentralisation and on the associated risk assessment. The Department will take into account the comments of the audit committee in the implementation of the decentralisation strategy.</P>

	<P>The earthquake which struck south Asia, particularly Pakistan, on 8 October has had devastating consequences. The unusually shallow nature of the quake caused widespread structural damage and current estimates put the dead at more than 70,000, including 17,000 children.</P>
        <P>Ireland was among the first countries to respond to the disaster and our quick response was widely welcomed. Within a few hours of the <Col N="1089"/>earthquake &euro;1 million was pledged towards immediate relief efforts in northern Pakistan and the surrounding regions. I remained in contact with the situation over the following hours and days. As the casualty figures rose dramatically, our response was increased to &euro;5 million, placing Ireland as one of the highest donors to the disaster on a <i>per capita</i> basis. Some of the pledges made by donors have not materialised into solid commitments. I support President Musharraf&rsquo;s call for more generous assistance, specifically from Islamic, EU and OECD states. It is essential that vital assistance is delivered in order to save lives.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;1.5 million of our assistance has been allocated to key UN humanitarian agencies, including UNICEF and the World Food Programme, WFP. More than &euro;2.5 million has been allocated to non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as Concern, GOAL, Oxfam, Plan Ireland and Tr&oacute;caire, which are active in the provision of essential services on the ground. These services include food, health, shelter, water and sanitation. The emergency phase of the disaster is by no means over. Many villages, communities and individuals remain vulnerable. Our key objective remains to save lives. In the longer term we will assist with restoring livelihoods and working towards recovery.</P>

	<P>Significant advances continue to be made in progressing initiatives which benefit Irish people abroad, including securing substantially increased funding for this purpose. The high priority which the Government attaches to this area of national policy is reflected in the establishment of a dedicated unit in my Department, the Irish abroad unit, to work exclusively on the issue.</P>
        <P>Funding for emigrant services continues to increase substantially. This year the allocation is more than eight times greater than it was in 1997. In all, grants in 2005 will amount to &euro;8.273 million, representing a 63% increase on last year. I expect to see a further significant increase in the coming year. A particular priority is the need to support our most vulnerable and marginalised communities abroad, in particular our older community in Britain. In this regard, the considerably increased funding has enabled enhanced support to be given to voluntary agencies engaged at the front line with vulnerable communities. In addition, these agencies are engaged in the provision of pre-departure services, as well as advice <Col N="1090"/>and assistance to emigrants wishing to return to Ireland.</P>
        <P>A second priority relates to the vulnerable circumstances of our undocumented community in the United States. The legislative debate in the US on immigration reform is entering a critical phase. In the light of the high priority which the Government attaches to securing the desired reform, and assisted by the important all-party resolutions passed recently in both Houses of the Oireachtas, I am intensifying our lobbying efforts, including through visits to Washington, New York and Boston. Likewise, I have instructed the embassy and the consulates in the US to intensify their lobbying in pursuit of our position. The Deputy can be assured that the welfare of our citizens abroad has the highest ongoing priority for the Government.</P>

	<P>When Irish citizens are sentenced to terms in prison abroad they are entitled under the Vienna convention on consular relations to seek consular assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the relevant Irish diplomatic mission. The mission will seek to ensure that prisoners are treated in a non-discriminatory manner; that their living conditions are as humane as possible; that they are legally represented; and that they can communicate with family, their legal representative, and the mission in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department tries to facilitate every request from an Irish prisoner for a consular visit and many prisoners are visited on more than one occasion. The Department&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of Irish prisoners are supplemented and complemented by the activities of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas. To demonstrate the official recognition of the importance of their work in this regard, I increased the total grant to the commission from &euro;162,000 in 2004 to &euro;213,444 this year.</P>
        <P>The Government has also agreed to carry out a research project to identify the number of Irish prisoners abroad and their needs for services. The terms of reference for this study have recently been agreed, and the study will be carried out by Mr. Chris Flood, the former Minister of State. The main focus of the study will be to establish the numbers of Irish prisoners abroad, the countries in which they are held, the offences for which they have been charged or convicted and the duration of sentences. It is also intended that it will review the services provided to Irish pris<Col N="1091"/>oners by the Government and by other social agencies and, <i>inter alia</i>, make recommendation on how these services might be improved.

Following the assessment process, each application receives a score, which gives its order of priority within its own county.</P>
        <P>When assessing individual applications, regard is had to the amount of funding being sought by each applicant for their project as well as other factors such as the population levels in each county, the amount of funding available for allocation, the existing level of facilities in an area, the quality of the applications received, and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required. Every effort is also made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>

	<P>The main purpose of the community employment programme operated by F&Aacute;S is to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups and thereby enable participants to advance successfully to employment in the open labour market. On 10 November 2004, following a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes &mdash; community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes &mdash; I announced that community employment places supporting the delivery of health services will continue to be ring-<Col N="1097"/>fenced. However, in line with Government policy, there are no plans to mainstream these community employment places.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>From inquiries made in my Department, 18 former employees of the company concerned were paid their statutory redundancy entitlements out of the social insurance fund. Two were refused on the ground that the claimants were not fully insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts and, therefore, not entitled to statutory redundancy. The payments were made direct to the 18 former employees out of the SIF on the basis that the company was in voluntary liquidation, insolvent and not in a position to pay the employees the statutory redundancy entitlements. In accordance with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003, I have sought recovery of 40% of the amount paid to the former employees from the liquidator of the company.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved. The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist this process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature. The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on the parties to an industrial dispute.</P>
        <P>When the Minister, Deputy Martin, met the workers, he informed them that the services of the Labour Relations Commission were available to help and support the parties in their efforts to resolve the dispute. To date, neither the employer, the employees or their representatives have been in contact with the Labour Relations Commission. Mr. Damien Cannon, regional manager, south and south west, of the Labour Relations Commission &mdash; telephone no. 086 8388 183 &mdash; remains available to assist the parties in resolving their differences.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the work permit section of my Department that an application was received on 28 January 2004 in respect of this person. The application was refused on the basis that two non-EEA directors of the named employer-company did not have the required business permission from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The employer was informed of this decision in writing and of its right of appeal. To date, no such appeal has been received.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Of the total gross job losses indicated above, 66% were attributable to losses in the textiles and clothing sector. As regards retraining initiatives, F&Aacute;S has played, and will continue to play, an active and very positive role in respect of company lay-offs and closures. Services offered by F&Aacute;S to workers losing their jobs comprise the following elements: liaison with senior management <Col N="1100"/>in the company affected with regard to how the process will be conducted; information sessions for all affected workers if required. The aim of these sessions is to outline the range of support and services available from F&Aacute;S and other public bodies. F&Aacute;S employment services staff conduct full registration interviews with all workers. These interviews help assess suitable career progression options for each redundant worker and identify their training and development needs. F&Aacute;S prepares a skills analysis report detailing a composite of the skills of the workforce. This is available to the development organisations such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland on request. A skills-training aspiration list is also compiled to inform F&Aacute;S of the required re-training and upskilling needs of the redundant workers. This training is delivered by various means; existing scheduled training programmes delivered by our three training centres within the region, Letterkenny, Gweedore and Sligo, or in the case of a specialist training requirement, at any F&Aacute;S centre throughout the country. Contracted training and community based training can also be availed of. In the past F&Aacute;S increased dramatically its range of contracted training courses to meet the retraining needs of redundant workers. Special training needs not catered for by the existing F&Aacute;S suite of programmes can be facilitated through its customised training fund, evenings-Saturday courses and e-learning options. The provision of information, career guidance and advice is an ongoing element of the service to redundant workers. Redundant workers are given initial and on-going information and support to keep them in touch with the labour market. They are advised of the F&Aacute;S Jobs Ireland database which allows jobseekers to register their curriculum vitae and source jobs via the Internet. They are also informed of the F&Aacute;S call centre which provides a job matching facility for jobseekers and they are provided with information on the cross-Border and Eures websites.</P>
        <P>In respect of redundant workers who do not succeed through the above interventions, they will be referred to F&Aacute;S once again via the national employment action plan strategy on reaching the six month unemployment threshold. They will then be assigned a F&Aacute;S officer and become a caseload client. They will be interacted with on a regular basis to assist their re-entry to the workforce. While most workers being made redundant would have availed of at least some of the services above, approximately 1,000 availed of full retraining over the past ten years.</P>

	<P>The total entrepreneurial activity rating is a measure used by the international global entrepreneurship monitor, GEM. It encompasses any type of entrepreneurial initiative, including self-employment as well as those taking specific actions to establish new enterprises. The GEM is a long-term, large-scale multinational research programme co-ordinated jointly by the London Business School and Babson College in the USA. The total entrepreneurial activity rating for Ireland for the year ending 31 December 2004, as measured by GEM, was 7.7%. The GEM research shows that Ireland&rsquo;s rating for 2004 was second only to Poland within the EU in entrepreneurial activity.</P>

	<P>In respect of the decentralisation of Enterprise Ireland headquarters, including 300 staff, to Shannon, the agency has identified the posts to be transferred and these are advertised as part of the central applications facility, CAF. The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new headquarters building designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Working closely with the OPW, a preferred site, a 13 acre site owned by Shannon Development, has been identified. The site was valued and a feasibility study carried out. When approval is received to proceed with its accommodation arrangements under decentralisation, Enterprise Ireland will undertake a detailed planning process in relation to staffing issues and the costs involved.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the Office of Public Works is in the process of acquiring a site in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, which will be suitable for the office accommodation requirements of the authority. As this process, including the planning, construction and office fit-out, will form a significant part of the overall costs of decentralisation, my Department is not in a position to give the full <Col N="1102"/>estimated cost of the financial implications involved. It is not possible at this stage to put an overall cost on the staffing and training issues associated with decentralisation. Much will depend on the final number of staff who opt to transfer and the arrangements that will be necessary to put in place for the authority to continue to carry out its statutory remit.</P>

	<P>My Department and the decentralising agencies under the aegis of my Department have completed a risk assessment exercise to assess direct and indirect risks, threats to and opportunities for the synergies between my Department and its agencies following decentralisation. Both Enterprise Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority have undertaken separate risk assessments within their own organisations to identify possible issues with regard to their own operations. In the case of Enterprise Ireland, following notification of the Government decision on decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland, the board of Enterprise Ireland received and noted a preliminary risk assessment of the implications of decentralisation for the agency. When approval is received to proceed with the agency&rsquo;s accommodation arrangements under decentralisation, a further risk assessment may be carried out, based on the situation then pertaining.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Health and Safety Authority, the authority has carried out a detailed risk assessment in regard to decentralisation. This assessment, which is set out in the decentralisation implementation plan submitted by the HSA to the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, includes plans to ensure vital national services are maintained during the transition period. This plan was considered and approved by the board of the HSA. The decentralisation implementation plan is revised on a periodic basis and the risk assessment is reviewed during this process having regard to developments that have taken place in the interim. The plan submitted by the authority is available for viewing on its website, <i>www.hsa.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>To maintain a detailed record of the cost of implementing the decentralisation programme, the authority has set up a specific accounting process that will track all costs associated with decentralisation. This will be subject to audit on an <Col N="1103"/>ongoing basis by both the HSA&rsquo;s internal auditors and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

	<P>In mid-October, I held a pre-budget forum which was attended by 31 representative organisations which included five of the members of the End Child Poverty Coalition. The five organisations were Barnardos, Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, Open, Pavee Point and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. At the forum, each organisation had the opportunity to present its key priorities for consideration in advance of budget 2006. I thank each of the members of the End Child Poverty Coalition for their contribution to the forum and the valuable work which they and many other organisations do in their communities.</P>
        <P>I have also received a written budget submission from the End Child Poverty Coalition, entitled Last Chance to End Child Poverty by 2007, which sets out a wide range of proposals relating to children. These proposals, with the proposals put forward by other organisations, will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned at the pre-budget forum, tackling the scourge of child poverty is one of the great challenges facing us today. It is a complex area and for the past year considerable time and effort has been devoted to analysing the issues and developing proposals on child income support and addressing the particular difficulties of lone parent families. For example, the National Economic and Social Council is examining the feasibility of a second tier child income support payment, which would replace child dependant allowance and family income supplement and would be paid in addition to child benefit to lower income families whether in employment.</P>
        <P>I will be giving careful consideration to all these proposals, including those of the End Child Poverty Coalition, in framing this year&rsquo;s social welfare budget package.</P>

This represented a level of increase equivalent to three times the projected level of inflation for 2005, thereby ensuring a real increase in the standard of living for all pensioners.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The farm assist scheme was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1999. The new scheme was designed specially for farmers on low incomes and replaced the existing smallholders <Col N="1106"/>assistance scheme. The scheme includes a preferential means test, taking into account both the farm income and off-farm self-employment of farmers and spouse.</P>
        <P>Like unemployment assistance and the previous arrangements for those in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance, these self-employed contributors are excepted from liability for class S PRSI under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. However, they are eligible to pay voluntary contributions, currently payable at &euro;253 per annum and is equivalent to the minimum contribution for class S contributors, to maintain their contribution record in respect of the period they are claiming farm assist. This provision is referenced in the information leaflet on the farm assist scheme.</P>
        <P>Farmers with income in excess of &euro;3,174 per annum who are not in receipt of a farm assist payment are insurable at PRSI class S are entitled to the following payments: widow&rsquo;s-widower&rsquo;s contributory pension; orphan&rsquo;s contributory allowance; old age contributory pension; maternity benefit; adoptive benefit; and bereavement grant.</P>
        <P>While credits may be awarded in particular circumstances, in general terms credited contributions are not awarded in respect of the farm assist payment. The rules which apply to credited contributions in general stipulate that the award of unemployment credits is limited to employed contributors. Credited contributions may not be awarded, however, where the last paid contribution made by the person in question was in respect of self-employment, class S, for example a self-employment farmer with earnings in excess of &euro;3,174 per annum.</P>
        <P>Any consideration of the question of providing for the award of class S credited contributions could not be confined to those persons in a particular sector or qualifying for a particular welfare payment, such as farm assist, but would also have to have regard to other groups formerly insured at class S. This could have considerable cost implications in terms of creating entitlements to benefits in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 420 and 432 together.</P>
        <P>In December 2003 as part of the Government&rsquo;s announcement of the new decentralisation programme, it was decided that 220 posts would be decentralised from my Department to Carrick-on-Shannon. The Office of Public Works commenced the process of identifying suitable accommodation in the town and it was decided to pursue a two phased approach to decentralisation to Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
        <P>Phase 1 will involve 130 posts and a building is scheduled to be ready for occupation in early 2007. The Department expects to be ready to commence the relocation of staff to Carrick-on-Shannon at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The central applications facility operated by the Public Appointments Service has, up to 7 September 2004, identified 273 staff who wish to relocate to Carrick-on-Shannon as a first preference and the grade breakdown is as follows: three principal officers, seven assistant principal officers, 19 higher executive officers, one administrative officer, 50 executive officers, 22 staff officers, 166 clerical officers and five other assorted posts.</P>
        <P>In the first phase the Department will require in the region of three principal officers, 12 assistant principal officers, 16 higher executive officers, 22 executive officers, seven staff officers, 67 clerical officers, and three services officers. The Department is well subscribed at most grades from amongst the first preference applications and, at those grades where there is a shortage of numbers, the Department is now in the process of identifying staff who may have Carrick-on-Shannon as an alternate choice on the central applications facility.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P><Col N="1110"/>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person. I made provision in budget 2005 for major improvements to the respite care grant. This includes the extension of the grant of &euro;1,000 to all persons providing full time care and attention, regardless of their means. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, will be entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers, especially in relation to respite, and it is estimated that overall over 31,000 carers will receive a respite care grant in 2005.</P>
        <P>According to census 2002 there are over 48,000 people providing personal care for over four hours per day. Almost 25,500 of these are in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. It is likely that a proportion of the balance is in receipt of a different social welfare payment, for example an old age pension. Unfortunately it is not possible to estimate the number of people who are in this situation and it is therefore not possible to estimate the cost of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal.</P>

	<P>Diet supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Any person who is receiving a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, who has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and who is unable to provide for his or her food needs from within his or her own resources, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Diet supplements are subject to a means test. Under the existing scheme, the amount of supplement payable in individual cases depends on which of two categories of diet, low cost or high cost, has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medi<Col N="1111"/>cal adviser, and the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the regulations governing the scheme a diabetic diet is categorised as a low cost diet and the amount of diet supplement payable would be &euro;44.00 less one third of the applicant&rsquo;s income &mdash; one sixth in the case of a couple.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the budget announcement allocating a weekly payment of &euro;35 per week to persons in residential institutions, who have not previously qualified for the disability allowance, is not payable to persons who are legally detained in the Central Mental Hospital; if he intends to amend the current legislation to permit this payment to be so paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The disability allowance, personal expenses rate, was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005, at an amount not exceeding &euro;35 per week, effective from 1 June 2005. This payment replaced the spending allowances, formerly paid by the health boards, to people in residential care since prior to 1999 who are not eligible for full disability allowance, solely due to their residency. The Social Welfare Act 1999 made provision for the retention of entitlement to disability allowance where a person who has been living at home subsequently enters residential care, effective from June of that year.</P>
        <P>During the administrative preparations for the introduction of the disability allowance, personal expenses rate, my Department contacted the Central Mental Hospital to establish if there were residents who might be eligible for this new payment. A person detained in legal custody is disqualified for receipt of disability allowance under the Social Welfare Acts.</P><Col N="1112"/>
        <P>There are a number of different categories of residency in the Central Mental Hospital as follows; those detained under the categories of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo; who are deemed to be detained in legal custody and are not eligible for payment of disability allowance under the social welfare Acts and those detained under the relevant mental health Acts who are not considered to be detained in legal custody and are therefore eligible for disability allowance.</P>
        <P>Residents in the Central Mental Hospital who are detained under the relevant mental health Acts are therefore eligible for disability allowance personal expenses rate and there are a number of such residents currently in receipt of this payment.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to amend the current legislation in relation to persons in legal custody. I do intend, however, to review the situation regarding people in residential settings who are not currently eligible for the payment of full disability allowance and to move towards the removal of this disqualification so that all persons in residential care will have an income maintenance payment on the same basis.</P>

	<P>The budget for 2005 provided,<i> inter alia</i>, for the extension of eligibility for the respite care grant to people providing full-time care and attention who are not in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance. Those in receipt of the latter payments receive the grant automatically without having to make a separate application.</P>
        <P>A total of 436 applications were refused. In 348 cases, the application was refused because the person to whom care was provided was found not to be in need of full-time care and attention. In 44 cases, the application was refused because the person providing care was self-employed, employed or signing on the live register and seeking employment. In 12 cases, the application was refused because the person was not providing full-time care and attention. In nine cases, the application was refused because the Health Service Executive had already paid the respite care grant in those instances. Three claims were withdrawn and the remaining 20 cases were rejected for a variety of other reasons. A full breakdown of the reasons for refusal by county is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

	<P>In August 2005, the payment frequency for customers paid by electronic fund transfer, EFT, was moved from weekly in arrears to weekly in advance. This brought EFT payments into line with personalised pension order, PPO, books payable at post offices.</P>
        <P>A once-off double payment was made to EFT pension and allowance customers in August 2005 to facilitate this change. The double payment consisted of one week&rsquo;s payment in arrears, which they would have normally received plus one week&rsquo;s payment in advance. These customers now receive their payments weekly in advance. Notification of the new arrangements and details of the period covered by the double payment were provided by my Department in advance to all the affected customers.</P>

	<P>There is no appeal pending in respect of the person indicated. However, an appeal is being processed in respect of his spouse.</P>
        <P>The person applied for disability allowance in December 2004. In the course of investigating his <Col N="1116"/>entitlement it came to light that he and his spouse owned a farm. This had not been disclosed when his spouse made a claim for disability allowance. On the basis of this discovery the deciding officer made a revised decision on his spouse&rsquo;s claim, the effect of which was to reduce the rate of disability allowance in respect of the period 24 November 2004 to 21 June 2005. As a consequence the spouse had been overpaid &euro;1,350.</P>
        <P>The spouse appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office. An appeals officer has considered the case and is of the opinion that an oral hearing is necessary. The spouse will be notified of the time, date and venue of the hearing when these have been arranged.</P>
        <P>The spouse is now in receipt of a qualified adult allowance in respect of the person concerned. The person has made a claim to be paid disability allowance in his own right and his application has been sent to a social welfare inspector for further investigation. A final decision on his entitlement will be made when this is to hand. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>To qualify for an unemployment payment a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work. Following a review, a deciding officer disallowed the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned from 2 November 2005, on the grounds that she was not available for or genuinely seeking full-time work. The person concerned stated that she had not looked for work and that she was not free to take up work as she has to mind her children. The person concerned has appealed this decision and her file is being sent to the independent social welfare appeals office. A decision will be made as soon as possible and she will be notified of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

        <P>Residents of local authority accommodation where central heating is provided at a low or subsidised level are not eligible for the allowance. In a recent review of addresses at which heating is provided at low cost by Dublin City Council by my Department, it emerged that the persons concerned are residing in accommodation where subsidised heating is provided by Dublin City Council and they are therefore not entitled to the allowance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme in question is a defined benefit scheme. In 1991 and 1994, the scheme was split with the result that there are now three schemes, one for staff, one for middle management and one for senior executives. In 1996, a member trustee of the staff scheme complained to the Pensions Board about specific financial issues associated with the splitting of the scheme which the trustee believed led to a deficit in the pension fund and difficulties in obtaining information.</P>
        <P>In October 1998, in a report to the then Minister, the Pensions Board indicated that it had received independent legal advice in relation to the trustee&rsquo;s concerns and concluded that there was no case for proceedings to be taken under the Pensions Act 1990. Following further representations, the Pensions Board agreed to conduct a further investigation.</P>
        <P>In October 2000, three KPMG consultants were appointed under section 18 of the Pensions Act as authorised officers to conduct the investigation. In June 2002, the report was completed and concluded that there had been no breaches of the Pensions Act except for one unintentional breach. The report was made available to the trustees of the pension scheme as appropriate parties within the meaning of the Pensions Act. While My Department and I have no role or influence with regard to specific Pensions Board investigations, I am satisfied with the conclusions <Col N="1118"/>of the board and that there is no further action that the board or my Department can take in this matter.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 empower local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Association to grant disabled person&rsquo;s parking permits. Permits are issued where the issuing body is satisfied that the applicant is suffering from a disability that prevents him or her from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking. The qualifying criterion therefore centres on the issue of mobility impairment and no specific medical condition is stipulated in the regulations. Disabled persons permits are valid for two years from the date of issue.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle to provide a preliminary breath specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed, or where a garda forms the opinion that the person has consumed alcohol.</P>
        <P>The purpose of preliminary roadside breath testing is to provide the garda&iacute; with a facility to assist them in determining whether a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle has consumed alcohol. However, the Road Traffic Acts provide that a person may be arrested for a drink driving offence without recourse to a preliminary breath test. In particular, there may be circumstances, especially in the context of a road collision, where it may not be possible for a member of the garda&iacute; to require that a person submit to a preliminary breath test.</P>

        <Quest>if the proposals from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to electrify the Maynooth suburban rail line and the provision of a new train station at Spencer Dock, which will increase frequency on the Maynooth suburban rail line have been approved; the cost of same, the likely delivery date of the projects; the reason a separate business case is required for each individual project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[32499/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A phased approach to the development of Maynooth suburban services is incorporated in Transport 21, the ten-year transport investment framework announced on 1 November. The city centre resignalling project will be completed in 2009. This will deliver four extra train paths per direction per hour, an increase from 12 to 16, into Connolly Station, which operates at capacity. At least one of these extra paths will be allocated <Col N="1123"/>initially to the Maynooth line. Later in 2009, the first phase of the Navan rail link will also be completed. This involves opening a spur off the Maynooth line from Clonsilla to Dunboyne and the construction of a new city centre station in the Docklands. When the new station is completed, Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann will operate western line services to Connolly and the new station in the interim period pending completion of the interconnector. This will allow for much-improved frequency patterns on the line.</P>
        <P>As part of the interconnector project, the line as far as Maynooth will be electrified so that DART-standard service frequencies and capacities may be operated on the line. A programme for the acquisition of electric railcars for the additional DART services is also included in Transport 21. The interconnector project and associated electrification is scheduled for completion in 2015 Because this phased approach is designed to accommodate short, medium and long-term capacity demand on the Maynooth corridor, each project must stand on its own merits. For that reason, separate business cases for each individual project are required under the Department of Finance guidelines for capital appraisal. However, each business case will also consider the long-term return on the investment that will undoubtedly accrue as short-term benefits are optimised with the roll-out of the individual projects. Each project will be the subject of a procurement process and I am not prepared to give details of the costings included in Transport 21 in advance of receipt of tenders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 443 and 444 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The director of the Mid-West Regional Authority wrote to me on 24 October 2005 regarding open skies between Ireland and the US in the context of the EU-US aviation negotiations which are ongoing and particularly whether I would carry out an impact study on the effects of open skies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reply to the director states that I am aware of a number of recent reports such as the Brattle report for the European Commission, the report <Col N="1124"/>of the tourism policy review group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Air Transport Users Council of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland report into open skies, which all support moving to open skies with the US and which emphasise the significant benefits to Ireland when this happens. In light of this, I do not believe that a further impact study of this kind is required.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear to both the US and the EU that the ongoing EU-US negotiations on an open skies agreement must take account of the need to provide an appropriate transition period for Shannon Airport while also securing early access to additional US destinations so that Ireland, in particular the mid-west region, can reap the benefits of an open skies policy.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <asker>Mr. Lowry</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if he has been briefed on a Bill before the US Congress (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[32509/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that Congressman Smith has tabled an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for the Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007, which is under consideration by the Houses of Congress in the US. This amendment calls for an economic impact study on the dual gateway policy.</P>
        <P>The content of US legislation is a matter for the US Congress. However, several recent reports such as the Brattle Report for the European Commission, the Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Air Transport Users Council of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland Report into Open Skies all support moving to open skies with the US and emphasise the significant benefits to Ireland when this happens. In light of this, I do not believe that a further impact study of this kind is required.</P>
        <P>The restructuring of the State airports, including Shannon Airport is intended to enhance their regional focus and I am encouraged by the close co-operation between the new Shannon Airport Authority and the other regional development bodies in the area. The recently announced Transport 21 ten-year plan for transport in Ireland will address the future infrastructural requirements of the mid west region. In particular, the plan will link Shannon Airport to the Atlantic road corridor, and will upgrade many of the national secondary routes in the vicinity of Shannon Airport. The plan also provides for the completion of the feasibility study of the Shannon rail link, which is examining linking Shannon Airport to Limerick and Galway. Transport 21 will therefore significantly boost Shannon Airport&rsquo;s catchment area in the west.</P><Col N="1125"/>
        <P>I have stated in previous replies, the development of an EU-US open-skies regime provides many opportunities for Shannon Airport to contribute to the development of the mid-west. The liberalisation of the aviation market between the EU and US will mean more, not fewer, opportunities for Shannon to develop new routes into North America.</P>
        <P>It has been the consistent policy of this Government that any change in transatlantic arrangements will be accompanied by an appropriate transitional arrangement to enable a smooth phasing in of open skies with the US in the future.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The ESIOP was the subject of a mid-term evaluation in 2003 which resulted in some re-allocation of monies between priorities. In recognition of performance up to that time, the European Commission decided to allocate the performance reserve for Ireland, &euro;134 million to the ESIOP. An update evaluation of the ESIOP was recently carried out in compliance with the relevant EU regulations. The report of that evaluation, by Indecon, was presented at the most recent meeting of the ESIOP monitoring committee on 28 October 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website shortly and a copy will be provided directly to the Deputy. The overall conclusions were that the significant investment of Exchequer and ERDF funding to date has led to notable achievements and improvements in physical infrastructure. Some of the main highlights include: 35% of the major inter-urban road network is complete to the required standard and given work in progress this should rise to 50% by 2007; there is significant work on other parts of the road network with the percentage level service D on other national primary routes equalling 90%; capacity on the DART and other suburban rail in Dublin has increased significantly; the two LUAS lines are completed adding an additional 12,500 peak morning capacity; Dublin Bus capacity has been enhanced and there have also been improvements in the QBC network; the rail safety programme has renewed 528.7 km of track and undertaken significant other enhancement works; 67 new mainline carriages have been purchased which will lead to further improvements in inter-city rail services; there has been <Col N="1131"/>significant progress in enhancing the water and waste water infrastructure with reductions in pollution and enhanced compliance with the water quality directives; 89 waste water schemes with a population equivalent of over 130,000 have been funded by the ESIOP. By 30 June 2005, &euro;306 million of private finance had been provided by the private sector to the national roads PPP programme.</P>
        <P>I gave a considerable amount of detail on capital projects for which my Department has responsibility in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 101 and 259 on 19 October 2005.</P>
        <P>The provision of information on specific projects in the health and environment areas is a matter for the Ministers responsible for these Departments.</P>

	<P>On 2 November 2005, I met a delegation from the midland railway action group accompanied by local representatives and headed by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, to discuss the matter of the re-opening of the Athlone to Mullingar railway line. At our meeting it was agreed that the group would revert to me with a detailed proposal supported by a coherent, complementary land use and settlement strategy and funding options. The group promised to submit such a proposal in six months&rsquo; time. I will review any such proposal when submitted.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>his plans to review the penalty points scheme in view of the road fatalities rate having been raised to their pre-penalty points levels; his proposals for more rigid enforcement and integration with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s points scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The operation of the penalty points system commenced with effect from 31 October 2002 in respect of speeding offences and was subsequently extended to apply to the offences of driving without insurance, careless driving and offences relating to the non-wearing of seat belts. Since its introduction, more than 265,100 drivers have incurred penalty points.</P>
        <P>The introduction of penalty points coincided with a significant reduction in road deaths. While the scale of reduction in deaths realised in the months immediately following the introduction of the system has not been maintained, the number of road deaths annually over the past three years is significantly lower than the levels recorded in preceding years. In the first three years since its introduction, the number of deaths as a result of road collisions fell by 136 by comparison to the previous three years.</P>
        <P>The extension of the system to other offences under the Road Traffic Acts will take place as soon as the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed. I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that the systems in <Col N="1133"/>question will be operational by April next year at the latest.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The North-South work programme, which was agreed by the North South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North. However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain. For that reason, it was agreed early in 2003 that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue. The development of a system of mutual recognition of penalty points presents complex legal questions and will require the negotiation of a bilateral agreement between the two Governments and probably the passage of primary legislation to support such an agreement. Enforcement of road traffic legislation is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

However, it did benefit from the advice of Goodbody Economic Consultants, which were engaged before work on the investment framework commenced, to review the business cases submitted by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in support of various projects, including its greater Dublin integrated rail network proposals, most of which are included in Transport 21.</P>
        <P>One of the key strategies adopted under Transport 21 was the development consistent with the national spatial strategy of a high quality national transport network with improved regional and local public transport networks and services. The national spatial strategy in turn took account of spatial planning in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>A central theme of Transport 21 is connectivity, including connectivity with the transport network of Northern Ireland and connectivity with the Border and north-west regions. Transport 21 addresses this, in particular in relation to road connections, by providing for the upgrading of the strategic roads linking Dublin with Northern Ireland and the north west, and the upgrading of the Atlantic corridor running from Letterkenny-Lifford to Waterford via Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork. Relevant projects included in Transport 21 are the completion of the M1 to the <Col N="1136"/>Border, the upgrading of the N2, the N3, N14 and N15. Targeted improvements to a number of national secondary routes, which are particularly important for regional development, will also be undertaken. This work includes the improvement of the Donegal coastal route, the N56, together with the other coastal routes along the western coast.</P>
        <P>Up to 2010, the main focus in the roads sector is on the completion of the motorways linking Dublin with the provincial cities and with Belfast. From 2010 to 2015, the focus switches to the other key national primary and secondary routes. In the period from 2006 to 2010 a number of key road projects on the strategic routes to Northern Ireland are due to be completed, including the M1, Dundalk-Border; the N2, Monaghan bypass, Castleblaney bypass, Ashbourne bypass-M50 Junction; the N3, Clonee-Kells; the N15, Bundoran-Ballyshannon bypass; and the N55, Cavan bypass link.</P>
        <P>In relation to the rail network, substantial investment has already been made over the past decade in the Dublin-Belfast railway line. Transport 21 provides for the removal of speed restrictions on the Belfast-Dublin-Cork railway lines south of the Border to reduce journey times on these routes further.</P>

	<P>It has been a long-standing policy of my Department to ensure that customers who wish to conduct their business through a choice of English or Irish can do so as far as practicable. Expenditure on providing services through Irish and English arises from our existing commitments to our customers and is met from our administrative budget. It is not possible, therefore, to readily separate the bilingual or Irish language dimension from the overall cost of running my Department and its service delivery. In this context and as part of its commitment to the principles of quality customer service prior to the coming into effect of the Official Languages Act 2003, almost all classes of documentation intended for public dissemination, including advertisements, are published in both Irish and English and signage is provided in Irish or bilingually. Staff in many of my Department&rsquo;s organisational units are in a position to provide services through Irish or English, as required by the customer.</P>
        <P>My Department, in September 2004, published its scheme under the Official Languages Act for the period 2004 to 2007. The scheme details specific additional commitments with regard to improved delivery of the services of the Department through the Irish language. All of these commitments, both long-standing and new, are being delivered from within the overall budgets available to my Department in the relevant years.</P>

	<P>The conditions of eligibility for which need to fulfilled in order to participate in the RSS are that applicants must be in receipt of farm assist or have been allocated a valid herd or flock number from the Department of Agriculture and Food and be in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit if previously on CE or disability allowance; or be self-employed fisherpersons on a fishing boat which has been entered in the register of fishing boats or have been issued with a fishing licence for fishing for salmon at sea from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and be in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit if previously on CE or disability allowance.</P>
        <P>The person in question, prior to commencement on this scheme, was signing for credited social insurance contributions &mdash; credits &mdash; with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Credited contributions are notional social insurance contributions which are awarded to an insured person in situations where pay related social insurance payment is not being paid by that person. My Department has established, following legal advice, that a person signing for credits has no underlying entitlement to participate on the scheme. To be eligible, a person must meet the aforementioned criteria. The participant in question can re-apply for a place on the scheme on expiry of the current contract. Any such application will be considered for eligibility by reference to these criteria.</P>

	<P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels. In 2004, the Finance Act 1999 was amended to provide for the introduction of a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels. A scheme under the Act was launched by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="1142"/>in April 2005. A total of 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date and eight projects were awarded excise relief under the scheme. Excise relief of &euro;6 million will be allowed for the successful projects over a two-year period to 2007. The scheme was open to applicants from all areas, including rural and Gaeltacht areas and is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.</P>
        <P>Under Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme, capital grant aid is also available for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of almost &euro;250,000 has already been awarded to support engine modifications of up to 100 vehicles and provide plant and monitoring equipment.</P>
        <P>In addition, SEI has provided grant aid of &euro;40,000 to Teagasc for a study to establish oil quality testing procedures for pure plant oil. This study will be critical to building market confidence. SEI also provided funding for the publication of a resource study on recovered vegetable oil and animal fats and study on quality assurance for rapeseed oil as a vehicle fuel.</P>
        <P>In 2004, SEI published a liquid biofuels strategy study for Ireland which examined the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland. I understand that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has had contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels. In the circumstances, there are no plans in this Department to carry out further research in this area. However, as part of the Department&rsquo;s overall remit with regard to Gaeltacht and rural development matters, we continue to maintain a close interest in these matters.</P>

	<P>From 1995 to 1998 the reported animal disease problems in the Askeaton area were the subject of a comprehensive multi-agency investigation under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The report of this investigation, which was published in August 2001, concluded that although a small number of farms experienced notable difficulties, there was no evidence of serious or unusual problems in the wider Askeaton area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no objective evidence available to my Department to suggest that there has been any change in the general animal health situation in the area since the final report was published. On that basis I do not believe that there are grounds which would justify the designation of a specific agency to take overall responsibility for monitoring the health database of animals in the area in question. Where individual problems occur, as would be the case anywhere in the country, the veterinary laboratory service of my Department is available to support local veterinary practitioners and their clients and this will remain the case.</P>
        <P>With regard to Askeaton, the regional veterinary laboratory in Limerick provides services free of charge where the private veterinary practitioner deems tests to be necessary.</P>

	<P>In Ireland responsibility for genetically modified foods comes under the aegis of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Minister for Health and Children, while responsibility for the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment rests with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. My Department has responsibility for animal feed containing genetically modified organisms and the actual cultivation and coexistence of approved genetically modified crops.</P>
        <P>In recent years a considerable amount of new legislation has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers aimed at strengthening the controls governing the approval, cultivation and use of genetically modified products and thereby ensuring that the highest standards are in place from a food safety and environmental aspect throughout the community.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the European Food Safety Authority has provided further safeguards in that it gives the citizens of the EU an independent scientific body with responsibility for the assessment, advice and communication of any risk associated with genetically modified organisms.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Commission decision taken on 31 August, the authorisation granted for GT73 oilseed rape for use in animal feed was in accordance with the procedures set out in Directive 2001/18/EC which comes within the remit of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P><Col N="1146"/>
        <P>While EU legislation governing genetically modified organisms is binding in all member states of the EU, member states are given subsidiarity in relation to coexistence between genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops, where they are allowed to draw up their own rules based on European Commission guidelines.</P>
        <P>In 2004 an interdepartmental group comprised of representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency, was established to examine issues related to coexistence and to draw up rules for coexistence arrangements in Ireland. The group has recently submitted its report and recommendations. In drawing up the recommendations contained in the report, the group took on board the full range of factors surrounding the genetically modified organisms issue, that is, the principles laid down in the Commission guidelines on genetically modified organisms, coexistence, Government policy on genetically modified organisms, scientific issues, new developments in genetically modified organisms technology, the Irish crop production system and farm infrastructure and liability.</P>
        <P>I will publish the report shortly and will invite observations on the recommendations in the report.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the report and of the concerns raised with regard to potential risks associated with crop spraying. The report, commissioned in June 2004, was published on 22 September. The report reflects public concerns brought to the attention of the Royal Commission, recognises the lack of evidence of causality and recommends that risk assessment techniques and methodologies be reviewed and that additional monitoring and health surveillance be undertaken.</P>
        <P>The arrangements in place in this country for the assessment of risks for bystanders who may be exposed when crops are sprayed take account of the most extreme exposures likely to occur and are based on consideration of health effects on all sectors of the community, including vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. Consideration is being given to the use of probabilistic approaches for the estimation of potential exposure workers and the public, an approach that is recommended in the report. The arrangements in place for the protection of bees are based upon identification of risks that may arise and the prescription of appropriate precautions to be followed when potential risks arise.</P>
        <P>The arrangements in place will be reviewed in the light of the instruments adopted following the updating of the existing EU regulatory system for plant protection products and the adoption of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on the sustainable use of plant protection products. The Commission proposals are likely to be tabled in Council and Parliament in the second quarter of 2006. The negotiations on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals will cover all aspects of the potential impact of plant protec<Col N="1148"/>tion products on human and animal health and on the environment</P>

	<P>In the autumn of 2003, my Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, set up a technical working group to determine whether earth-lined stores, out-wintering pads and constructed wetlands or reed beds should have a place in agricultural practice.</P>
        <P>The working group has taken expert advice from a variety of researchers and other sources and has been preparing detailed specifications and guidance documents for each of these systems. The specifications and guidance documents for the earth-lined stores have been submitted to my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and are being considered.</P>
        <P>The guidance documents and specifications are being finalised for constructed wetlands and a recommendation will be made to the two Departments as soon as this work is complete.

	<P>In 2002, the person named applied for additional milk quota under the 32 million litre scheme in the animal disease category. Applicants in this category were required to prove that more than 10% of the dairy herd was lost due to certain diseases in 1978, 1979 or 1980 and that milk deliveries in any of the years 1978, 1979 or 1980 were higher than the sum of the initial 1984 quota allocation plus any allocations from the national reserve. As the application did not satisfy all the conditions, the applicant was not eligible for an allocation.</P>
        <P>In 2003, an appeal was received in this case and documentation was provided that indicated that more than 10% of the dairy herd was lost due to animal disease in the period 1978 to 1980. However, as the milk deliveries in any one of those reference years was not greater than the sum of the initial 1984 quota allocation plus any subsequent allocations from the national reserve the person failed to qualify for an allocation.</P>
        <P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 519 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, NSC, was set up in 1997 to provide a co-ordinated response from the many statutory and voluntary bodies involved in responding to the problem of violence against women. My Department, in conjunction with the NSC, has conduc<Col N="1151"/>ted a series of successful awareness raising campaigns dealing with various aspects of this issue in recent years. The NSC is developing a strategic plan for its work over the next five to ten years which will include the development of a long-term and wide-ranging strategy for raising public awareness of the issue of violence against women. The strategic plan should be completed early next year and will be widely circulated at that time. In preparing this plan, the committee is reviewing a range of issues identified and recommendations made in the area of combating violence against women, including those arising from the conclusions of the UN committee referred to as well as the National Crime Council report on domestic violence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This strategy is expected to address the information and awareness needs of relevant public officials and health professionals, in partnership with the training and education arrangements already in place for the groups in question. Provision of resources for such training will remain a matter for the relevant agency in each case. In the case of the Judiciary, which is independent in the exercise of its functions under the law and the Constitution, the Deputy should note that the provision of training and education is a matter for the Judicial Studies Institute which was established in 1996 for this purpose. My role in this regard is to support any programmes put in place by the institute through funding made available in the courts Vote which is administered by the Courts Service.</P>

	<P Just="Left">School age child care is an important part of the range of child care services which need to be developed and supported to meet the needs of parents and their children in the Ireland of 2005. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, EOCP, 2000-2006, which is implemented by my Department, has been an important landmark development in Irish child care policy.</P>
        <P>It is widely acknowledged that the EOCP has been a highly successful programme which is now expected to result in the creation of almost 40,000 new child care places. This is particularly significant in the context of the increased labour market participation of women and the pressure for non-parental child care services which this creates. As the EOCP has developed, it has become clear that there is a need to make further progress in the specific area of school age child care services. Such services are often necessary to support the needs of parents for child care before, and or after, school hours as well as outside of school terms.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20- ?><P>The national childcare co-ordinating committee, which brings together representatives from across the entire child care sector, recognised this need for improved school age child care services, by commissioning a working group on school age child care to develop a report. I was very pleased to launch the working group&rsquo;s excellent report on school age child care in Ireland, in June of this year.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?><P>The report makes a number of recommendations, some of which relate specifically to the use of school premises or school lands for the delivery of school age child care. These recommendations are clear that such usage must be appropriate in the particular circumstances and that any child care facility located in a school setting must be of a standard equivalent to the high, child-focused specification recommended for stand alone school age facilities, or for the school age child care elements of integrated services. This is in keeping with the overall objectives of the EOCP to provide a quality child care services.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20- ?><P>The development of school age child care services is a very important and necessary part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting parents in their responsibility to provide appropriate care arrangements for their children into their teenage years. I am pleased, therefore, to inform the Deputy of the recent new initiative <Col N="1153"/>launched by my Department to stimulate local interest in the development of school age child care services. This initiative is being led at local level by the city and county child care committees and is intended to bring together all interested stakeholders, including parents, school boards of management, local authorities, other relevant agencies and child care providers. I am hopeful that this process will identify local service needs and local resources which are available to meet them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 and 530 together.</P>
        <P>Under the law as it stands, married parents living together are joint guardians and custodians of their child. If they separate, the custody is normally with the parent with whom the child primarily resides, but the other parent still remains a guardian.</P>
        <P>An unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, appointing the father as a guardian of his child, without having to go to court.</P>
        <P>Under section 11B of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 9 of the 1997 Act, any person who is related to a child, including a grandparent, or any person who has acted <i>in loco parentis</i> to a child, may apply to the court for leave to apply for access to the child. In deciding on such appli<Col N="1159"/>cations, the court will have regard in particular to the applicant&rsquo;s connection with the child, the risk, if any, of the application disrupting the child&rsquo;s life to the extent that the child would be harmed by it, and the wishes of the child&rsquo;s guardian.</P>
        <P>In all family law proceedings relating to the upbringing of a child, the court must always regard the child&rsquo;s welfare as the first and paramount consideration. Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child&rsquo;s wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child. In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her parents. Section 11D of the 1964 Act, inserted by the 1997 Act, obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child&rsquo;s best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Act also provides for an emphasis on counselling and mediation as alternatives to court proceedings concerning the custody of and access to children. It encourages couples who are in dispute to think in terms of agreeing to the custody of and access to their children, without the need for court interventions. Before instituting proceedings for guardianship, custody or access, a solicitor must discuss with the parent the possibility of engaging in counselling and mediation to assist in effecting an agreement between the parties. The court may adjourn any proceedings for the purpose of enabling attempts to be made by the parties to reach agreement, with or without the assistance of a third party, on some or all of the issues in dispute. An agreement in writing between parties relating to custody, access or maintenance can be made a rule of court and thus become enforceable in the same way as if it were a court order. Mediation on the various issues is by its nature a voluntary act to be undertaken by two persons who are in dispute.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency, operating under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, following the enactment of the Family Support Agency Act 2001, brings together programmes designed to support ongoing parenting relationships for children. Its functions include the provision of a family mediation service, both directly or through support for others providing these services, and the administering of grants for such purposes.</P>
        <P>As regards the hearing of family law cases in general, the <i>in camera</i> rule has recently been relaxed in that the law now allows certain classes of persons to attend family law cases to draw up and publish reports, subject to certain safeguards including a requirement that the parties to a case or any relevant child would not be identifiable. I am aware of the concerns of men and fathers in <Col N="1160"/>the area of family law. Operation of the law in this whole area is being kept under review in my Department.</P>

        <P>I understand from inquiries I have made that the group has recently submitted an application to my Department for additional capital funding of &euro;39,500. This application has been forwarded to Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, which is engaged to assess all EOCP grant applications on behalf of my Department. Following the assessment by ADM, this application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, PAC, which is chaired by my Department, before a decision is made in relation to funding.

	<P>The application in question was received by my Department on 27 July 2005. Having given full consideration to the matter, this application was refused because my Department was not satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied, that the applicant could maintain himself while residing in the State without recourse to public funds. The fact that the applicant also overstayed on a previous visit visa and married an Irish national while in the State illegally was also considered.</P>
        <P>The refusal reasons were faxed to the applicant on 8 September 2005 and e-mailed to the appli<Col N="1161"/>cant on 25 September 2005. Correspondence has been forwarded to the Deputy&rsquo;s office detailing this information.</P>

The application form also included a statutory declaration to be signed by applicants indicating their acceptance, <i>inter alia</i>, that the granting of permission to remain does not confer any entitlements or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related or not, to enter the State. The parents concerned both signed this statutory declaration. Family reunification under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 only relates to persons granted refugee status.</P>

        <P>An in-depth assessment of the financial implications is an integral part of the decentralisation process. To this end, it has been agreed centrally that each Department and organisation will identify and monitor the types of incremental non-property costs and savings associated with the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme during the relocation and transition phases of the <Col N="1163"/>programme as well as during the post-decentralisation phase.</P>
        <P>This assessment encompasses all of the possible activities the Deputy has outlined such as training, recruitment and redeployment. As regards the agencies referred to by the Deputy, the costs to date have been fully monitored but they have been limited so far to some additional training, administration and management functions which the agencies have found it necessary to introduce to bring the programme forward. Every effort will be made to minimise the costs and maximise the savings as the decentralisation programme is rolled out.</P>
        <P>The analysis of the financial implications of decentralisation is also being used as an important tool to assist in the ongoing work of risk identification and mitigation which is being carried out by each agency. As the Deputy will be aware, their risk assessments and risk responses are set out in some detail in each of the agencies&rsquo; decentralisation implementation plans which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>All the risk mitigation strategies in relation to decentralisation will be taken into account within the overall framework of the risk assessment and management process which forms a permanent part of my Department&rsquo;s corporate governance arrangements. In that context, a high level corporate risk register is being compiled and the audit committee in my Department, which is independent, may in due course review the decentralisation risk assessments and strategies in the light of the audit work which will need to be carried out in respect of the risk management process as a whole.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If a person who is the subject of a valid deportation order wishes to return to the State that person may apply to have the deportation order revoked under section 3(11) of <Col N="1164"/>the Immigration Act 1999. There is no automatic right of residency for a non-EU national who marries an Irish national. However, a non-EU national who marries an Irish national may apply for permission to enter and reside in the State with his or her Irish national spouse. It is the normal procedure where an application is received from a person who is the subject of a deportation order and has married an Irish national outside the State that both the revocation and the residency issues are considered at the same time.</P>
        <P>The person in question is the subject of a valid deportation order signed on 2 July 2002 following a failed asylum application in the State. He was deported on foot of this order in August 2002 and is obliged to remain outside the State. He subsequently re-entered the State on a date unknown and was deported again in January 2004. He married an Irish national in his home country in August 2005. An application was made on his behalf by his wife for the revocation of the deportation order on 9 September 2005. This application was acknowledged on 21 September 2005 and an opportunity was offered to the person in question to make further representations as to why the valid deportation order in place should be revoked. The matter is under consideration and it is expected that a decision will be made shortly.</P>

	<P>Since the introduction of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, sections 27 and 28 of the Act have been amended to increase prize limits for charitable lotteries on three occasions. SI 72 of 1987 increased prize limits in sections 27 and 28 of the Act from IR£300 to IR£3,000 and from IR£500 to IR£10,000, respectively. SI 174 of 2000 amended section 28 of the Act to increase the prize limit from IR£10,000 to IR£15,000 for periodic lotteries. A further amendment to section 28 was made by SI 29 of 2002 to round up the prize limit from IR£15,000 &mdash;&euro;19,046.07 &mdash; to &euro;20,000. There are no plans to increase charitable lottery prize limits further.</P>

	<P>The application in question was received by my Department on 24 August 2005. The application received a thorough investigation by the visa officer and was refused on the basis of inconsistencies in the information supplied by the applicant. During an interview with an official of the visa office in Moscow, the applicant gave details of her employment which were found to be inconsistent with information given in two previous applications. Credibility is central to the visa determination process and the onus is on the applicant to provide my Department with accurate information. In this case the visa officer was not satisfied, based on the information provided, that a visa should issue. This decision and the precise reasons for refusal were notified to the spouse of the applicant by e-mail on 28 October 2005.</P>
        <P>It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa within two months of the decision by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department. The correspondence mentioned above also included details of the documentation that should be submitted in the event of an appeal.</P>

        <P>The person concerned did not make an application for leave to remain under these new arrangements and has no entitlement to join family members in the State. The wife of the person concerned completed the application form where it is clearly stated on the front page that residency granted on this basis does not give any entitlement to be joined in the State by other family members. The application form also included a statutory declaration to be signed by applicants indicating their acceptance, <i>inter alia</i>, that the granting of permission to remain does not confer any entitlements or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related or not, to enter the State. The wife of the person concerned signed the statutory declaration to this effect on her application form. Family reunification under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 only relates to persons granted refugee status.</P>

        <P>The proposed defamation Bill will contain provision to confer statutory recognition on an applicant organisation to be the press council of Ireland. The press council would be an independent body, broadly representative of civic society, with minority representation from publishers and journalists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Statutory recognition, by way of a resolution to be moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas, may be conferred on an independent organisation which might formally request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be recognised as the press council for the purposes of the legislation. Recognition would confer certain privileges such as immunity from action in respect of their judgments, decisions, directions, etc., or those of a subsidiary body, such as a press ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The proposed press council would have to conform to criteria for recognition set down in the Bill. A recognised press council would have, as its central focus, a code of standards supported, and subscribed to, by print media organisations with operations in the State. The code of standards would provide an added protection to citizens&rsquo; privacy from media intrusion and harassment. It <Col N="1168"/>is also envisaged that the press ombudsman would be established by the press council to deal with complaints from those affected by breaches of the code of standards.</P>

        <P>In relation to persons evading deportation, the number of such persons on our records is approximately 6,500.

For example, in the case of the Irish-born child scheme initiated <Col N="1172"/>in January of this year, a total of 17,877 applications for leave to remain were received of which, as of 2 November 2005, 15,075 have been granted.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether decisions to deport the parents of school-age children including Irish children, thereby preventing them from beginning or remaining in school, contradicts his own assertion as to the moral force of granting residency to a family whose children had been attending school.</Quest>
        <QRef>[32823/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the response made on my behalf to a motion on the D&aacute;il Adjournment debate on this issue on 5 May 2005.</P>
        <P>My position remains the same and is reiterated here. I ask the Deputy to consider what the consequences of a policy not to deport the parents of school-age children would be. In effect, no person in any form of State education and, by implication, none of their other family members, could be deported from the State for a considerable part of the year. Further, the logic of such a policy would be that a person at any point in the education system leading up to an exam could not be deported.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most persons who would be subject to deportation would have arrived in the State as asylum seekers. It must be borne in mind that a substantial number of asylum seekers are of an age when they are likely to be engaged in the State education system, where examinations of one sort or another are a common feature. For example, in 2003, of the 7,900 asylum applicants almost 1,100 were accompanied minors between the ages of four and 18. Similarly, in 2004, of the 4,766 asylum applicants, more than 700 were accompanied <Col N="1178"/>minors between the ages of four and 18. To give a guarantee that none of those persons &mdash; and again, by implication, their siblings and parents &mdash; would be deported or even issued with deportation orders during a substantial part of the year would be gravely irresponsible. Ireland would be sending out a message to the world that it has an obligation to provide an education, including the right to sit examinations, to all those who, having been found not be in need of international protection, have otherwise no right to be in the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the opening hours of the Garda station at Clane, County Kildare, are 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., Monday to Saturday, and 12 noon to 2 p.m. on Sunday. I am also informed that local Garda management does not intend to extend the opening hours of Clane Garda station at this time. Local Garda management state that resources are utilised to ensure that stations are opened for the periods outlined, in conjunction with ensuring car patrols, foot patrols and all other areas of policing are also addressed. I am further advised that the extension of the opening hours of Clane Garda station would necessitate the employment of <Col N="1179"/>additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign of 1,100 Garda recruits each year to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will now draw plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Clane Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

However, itis aware of a private club off Grafton Street that provides casino-type facilities to members of the club. This private club was recently visited by a senior Garda officer and no irregularities were detected that would justify a prosecution under the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 86, which is the relevant legislation for such matters. I am assured that the premises will continue to receive Garda attention and if breaches of the legislation are detected the directions of the Chief State Solicitor will be sought. There are no proposals currently to amend the law in this matter.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, a Nigerian national, and her infant daughter arrived in the State on 31 January 2005 and applied for asylum. Her claim was refused by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and she was informed of that recommendation, which included her dependants, on 18 February 2005. The person concerned appealed this recommendation and her appeal was heard on 21 April 2005 by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The appeal was rejected and she was informed of this decision by letter dated 17 May 2005. This letter also informed her that the decision applied to dependants included in her appeal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed by letter dated 30 August 2005 that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her daughter. She was, in accordance with the Act, given the options to be exercised within 15 working days of, making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her daughter should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before deportation orders were made; consenting to the making of deportation orders. Representations have been made to my Department requesting that the person concerned and her daughter be allowed to remain in the State. I expect the file to be submitted to me for decision in due course.</P>

	<P>The Government has accepted in principle the recommendations in the Ferns report and has given a commitment to their implementation by all relevant Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>The Ferns inquiry has identified a gap in the criminal law regarding failure to act to alleviate the risk of injury or sexual abuse of a child. The report recommends that consideration should be given to the introduction of a new criminal offence which would apply to situations where any person, wantonly or recklessly, engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child or wantonly or recklessly fails to take reasonable steps to alleviate such risk where there is a duty to act. I am at present examining that recommendation with a view to introducing an appropriate amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill which is at present before this House.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other recommendations which fall within my specific area of responsibility, I am examining legal aid provisions with a view to giving effect to the recommendation that legal aid, irrespective of means, be available to both complainants and priests against whom allegations are made where the cases are not determined by the criminal courts. I am also examining in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office the recommendation that certain documents relating to child sexual abuse should be given legal privilege.</P>
        <P>The report contains a number of recommendations relating to Garda procedures. I have forwarded a copy of the report to the Garda Commissioner who will consider it and take on board its recommendations in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">For several years now Ireland has been operating one of the most liberal economic migration systems in Europe with large numbers entering the State legally for employment purposes. In addition, we are one of the few <Col N="1183"/>states in Europe to have granted full access to our labour market on enlargement of the EU to citizens of the new member states. Currently, there are more than 130,000 non-nationals registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau. They are legally resident in the State with up-to-date permissions to remain and renew their permissions when it is necessary.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.8- ?>
        <P>Amnesties, in my view, undermine the system of legal migration by rewarding those who have no legal basis for their residence in the country including those who were unwilling to use legal migration channels. Also, they reward those who abuse our asylum system by claiming international protection when they are not in need of it. It is an integral element of any asylum system that those who are not in need of protection should be returned to their countries of origin. International experience is that amnesties in turn, encourage more illegal immigration.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to grant an amnesty to persons illegally present in the State. Such persons should, if they wish to acquire legal status here, return to their countries of origin and seek to enter Ireland through the legal channels available.</P>

I do not envisage any change in this practice in the immediate future.</P>
        <P>A person awaiting a decision on a residency application based on marriage to an Irish national is free to leave the State at any time. As a visa-required national, that person must be in possession of a valid Irish visa to allow the person concerned travel to the State. While it is not the normal practice of my Department to assist persons who do not have residency in the State with a re-entry visa prior to travelling, in certain exceptional circumstances assistance may be given to the spouse of an Irish national. Applications of this nature are considered on a case-by-case basis by the immigration division of my Department.</P>

	<P>The information sought in Parliamentary Question No. 596 of 28 June 2005 was not available at that time. I have since been informed by the Garda authorities that as a result of an incident at Bunratty Castle Hotel on 3 August 1993, criminal allegations were made against two off-duty garda&iacute;. The two members in question subsequently received District Court convictions for assault and being drunk and disorderly. Pursuant to these convictions, both members were dismissed from the force in accordance with regulation 40 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 1989.</P>
        <P>One of the members subsequently appealed his conviction to the Circuit Court, where the District Court conviction was affirmed. The member in question then took a judicial review to the High Court, which granted an order of <i>certiorari</i> quashing the dismissal order. The member was re-instated and was the subsequent subject of separate disciplinary proceedings under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 1989. Following the completion of the disciplinary investigation, a sworn inquiry board was appointed to hear the breaches of discipline alleged against the <Col N="1186"/>member. The board convened on 11 July 2000 and penalties were imposed in respect of this member.</P>
        <P>In regard to the other member concerned, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter as it is currently the subject of legal proceedings, that is, an application by him is currently before the High Court.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Encounter, which commenced in February 2002, is a Garda initiative aimed at providing high visibility Garda foot patrols in areas where large numbers of people socialise late at night and in the early morning. It is aimed at dealing effectively with public order issues, especially problems associated with drunk<Col N="1190"/>enness, including sections 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; under-age drinking, including the sale by or sale for under-age persons; and assaults contrary to sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. I am further informed that in excess of 284,000 offences have been detected to date during the ongoing Operation Encounter.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that Littleton Garda station is a one-man Garda station and a sub-station of Thurles Garda station, divisional headquarters. I have been further informed that Littleton Garda station is open for a minimum of one hour per tour of duty and is also open by appointment or arrangement, according to daily requirement. In the absence of the member, all calls are dealt with by Thurles Garda station.</P>
        <P>Garda management states that the private residence attached to Littleton Garda station was the subject of an arson attack on Sunday, 24 July 2005 and that three separate fires were found within the private residence. The scene was preserved and technically examined and the incident is subject to ongoing investigation. The official accommodation has not been occupied since then and the building is in the process of being refurbished. <Col N="1193"/>However, the Garda station at Littleton has remained open to the public.</P>
        <P>Garda management also states that at 3.38 a.m. on 2 November 2005, the intruder alarm was activated at Littleton Garda station. At 3.44 a.m., a fire alarm was received at the same location. On arrival at the scene, the Garda found there was smoke coming from inside the Garda station. Fire services were requested and assistance directed to the scene. A person was arrested on the same date and an investigation file is being prepared for submission to the law officers for direction in early course. A portakabin will serve as a Garda station pending completion of repair works.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management state they are satisfied that the resources attached to Littleton Garda station are utilised effectively to provide an adequate policing service to the residents of the sub-district, and that there are no plans to allocate additional Garda personnel to the station. In regard to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. The needs of the Littleton area will be considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On 18 December 2002, the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the draft optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, OPCAT. Ireland, along with other EU partners, fully supported the draft optional protocol and worked for its adoption at the UN General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The object of the protocol is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken by independent international and national bodies to places of detention with a view to preventing torture and <Col N="1194"/>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The international body is proposed to be a subcommittee of the UN Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. The national bodies may consist of one or several bodies as national mechanisms for the prevention of torture at the domestic level.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s position in regard to the ratification of international instruments generally, including the optional protocol, is constantly reviewed in light of prevailing circumstances and in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments. My Department continues to review national legislation to ascertain whether legislative changes would be required before signature and ratification of the optional protocol. Consultations have commenced with other Departments and bodies, including the Departments of Health and Children, Defence, and Education and Science, in regard to arrangements for the inspection of institutions for which they are responsible in which persons may be detained without their consent.</P>
        <P>Ireland ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which entered into force for Ireland on 1 February 1989. The Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, which comes under the aegis of the Council of Europe, was established under this convention and operates a system of international visits across Europe. The committee visited Ireland in 1993, 1998, and 2002.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In 2001, the Government approved an extensive programme of civilianisation to be introduced on a phased basis over several years. This includes the posts referred to by the Deputy. The programme provided for the civilianisation of these posts in the short, medium and long term; the transfer of the finance function from Garda district clerks to civilian staff; and the transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as civil servants of the State. More than 1,000 clerical, administrative and services posts are filled by civilians in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Included in this cohort are 113 staff officers occupying district finance officer positions.</P>
        <P>The transfer of civilian staff of the Department to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the transfer of the finance function is almost complete. However, the next phase of the civilianisation programme, including the civilianisation of the posts referred to by the Deputy, must be rolled out within the confines of the Government decision of 4 December 2002 which placed a cap on numbers across the Civil Service and public service. The Department is, as a matter of priority, reviewing the position with both the Department of Finance and Garda management as to how it will proceed further with Garda civilianisation in the context of the overall constraints of Civil Service and public service numbers.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the review is to enable, to the greatest extent possible, movement to front-line policing of desk-bound garda&iacute; from administrative and technical functions to operational duties. This is in keeping with the general policy that civilianisation allows certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and allows garda&iacute; to focus on work more suited to their training and skills, thereby increasing overall operational capacity within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. With that in mind, the Government earlier this year agreed in principle to the re-assignment of staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food who are based in Davitt House, Castlebar, to a new Garda unit, the Garda information service centre, GISC, to perform administrative functions for the Garda. The immediate focus is on the transfer of the Castlebar staff and dealing with the personnel and industrial relations issues that arise.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 30 August 2005. The application was deemed ineligible on the basis that the person concerned did not meet the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. This decision was communicated to the person referred to by the Deputy in September 2005.</P>
        <P>I understand the subject matter of the recent correspondence from the Deputy stated there were delays in the renewal of the person&rsquo;s work permit, leading to delays in the renewal of his residency permission. However, the Act provides that in determining residency for the purposes of naturalisation, no period shall be reckoned where the applicant did not have the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State. This particular statutory provision does not provide for the reasons that such permission not be taken into account.</P>
        <P>I further understand the latest permission to remain of the person concerned expired in August 2005 and that he has not yet applied to his local immigration officer to renew this permission. Unfortunately, the consequence of this is that he cannot now comply with the statutory provision of having 12 months continuous reckonable residence prior to the date of application until October 2006 at least and that is dependant on him renewing his permission before the end of this month.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the National Youth Council of Ireland&rsquo;s current campaign for the allocation of additional funding for the development of youth work in Ireland, including the further implementation of the national youth work development plan. The financial provision for the main funding line for the youth work sector in 2005 represents an 18% increase over 2004 and brings that financial provision to &euro;33.889 million in 2005. This additional funding is catering for a number of developments under the Youth Work Act 2001 and the national youth work development plan and for enhancements to existing youth work programmes and services.</P>
        <P>With regard to the national youth work development plan, to date additional funding has been provided in the following areas: the establishment of ten new special projects for disadvantaged youth; the upgrade of 20 single worker special projects to two worker projects; review of youth work funding; review of youth information provision; continued support of the child protection training programme; establishment of a development fund for youth work organisations; North-South youth work training endorsement panel.

The early start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk. There are currently 12 early start projects in the north Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Targeted early childhood education provision will be a key element of the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched in May of this year. The plan&rsquo;s objective is to concentrate early education actions on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. On a phased basis, the 150 urban/town primary school communities serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage will be provided with access to early education for children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend these primary schools. My Department anticipates being in a position to notify participating schools on the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department currently funds 46 pre-school classes for Traveller children. In the special needs sector there are currently 14 pre-school classes <Col N="1200"/>for children with autism located throughout the country. In addition to this, ten stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age. My Department has also sanctioned the establishment of a pre-school for six children with hearing impairment on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>There are seven pre-schools for Travellers and three pre-schools for autism in north Dublin. In addition, the Rutland Street Project in Sean McDermott Street has been operational since 1969. It caters for approximately 95 pupils aged three to five years and includes a pre-school centre, a special staff teaching allocation, classroom assistants, secretarial services and cooks, together with the provision of school meals.</P>
        <P>The bulk of pre-school places in the country are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years. The Department of Health and Children also provides grants to child care groups, including to community groups in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The Northside Partnership is currently developing an integrated plan entitled &ldquo;Preparing for Life&rdquo;, which is intended to address the needs of children at each stage of their development to better prepare them for school. The plan involves mentoring and group training for parents to improve their skills, esteem and aspirations for their children. It is intended that the project will result in improved physical and psychological health and better educational outcomes for children at key stages in their development to the point of reception in school.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is independent in the performance of its functions in accordance with the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and my Department is not a party to the consideration of applications for financial redress. If the person mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question has accepted an award made by the board or by the review committee on review, he must agree in writing to give up any right he may have to bring a claim for damages in the courts in respect of the abuse and injuries covered by the award. The person is given one month in which to decide if this is what <Col N="1201"/>he wishes to do. Once the board has received this agreement the payment will issue as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Section 27 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that all reasonable legal costs and other costs associated with the preparation and presentation of an application to the redress board will be met by the board. In the event that agreement cannot be reached between the board and the applicant&rsquo;s legal representative, the matter is referred to the Taxing Master of the High Court for determination.</P>
        <P>The redress board&rsquo;s application form highlights the fact that if a person is represented by a solicitor all correspondence in connection with their application is sent directly to the solicitor and the board&rsquo;s guidelines and other publicity material states that all reasonable legal costs incurred in respect of applications for redress are payable by the board.</P>

        <Quest>the number of primary school students in County Louth who are in classes of 30 or more; and if this is an increase on 2004.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 2004-05 school year a total of 3,754 primary school pupils &mdash; provisional figure &mdash; were taught in classes of 30 or more pupils in County Louth. The 2005-06 census of primary schools has commenced. As the census date is 30 September 2005 it will be some months before all school returns have been received and processed in my Department. When this process has been completed class details for 2005-06 will be available.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that the number of children in classes of more than 30 nationally has halved since this Government took office. Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 4,500 additional teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. The annual estimated value of the additional expenditure on these posts is more than &euro;200 million.</P>
        <P>In 1996-97, the average class size in our primary schools was 27. It is now 24. In 1996-97 there was one teacher for every 22 children in our primary schools. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. While there is more to be done to reduce class sizes further, it should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>While the average class size nationally has been brought down to 24, I am committed, in line with Government policy, to delivering further reductions in class sizes for the under nines. In <Col N="1204"/>achieving the Government target for smaller class sizes, priority must, in the first instance, be given to children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas. Under the new action plan for tackling education disadvantage which I launched last May, more children in disadvantaged schools will be in classes of 20 in the current school year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the number of classes of more than 30 in our schools, the general rule is that schools are staffed on the basis of having a maximum class size across the school of 29. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>

	<P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, that is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, with regard to all schools, NEPS processes applications on behalf of students with specific learning disabilities for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>The number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 on the date of establishment of NEPS to a current figure of 121, including three NDA psychologists working in NEPS and one psychologist on assignment to the further education section of the Department. There are also four psychologists on career break.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to NEPS. Candidates were asked to indicate regions in which they were prepared to serve. My Department is currently in the process of appointing eight psychologists from the panels. The internal management group in NEPS identified the following priority regions for appointment: mid-west region &mdash; four appointments; south-west area of eastern region &mdash; two appointments; north-west region &mdash; one appointment; south-east region &mdash; one appointment. Any increase in the overall numbers of psychologists in NEPS must take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the 1997 Universities Act. Chapter II of the 1997 Universities Act refers to the governance of universities and, specifically, section 18 relates to the functions of the governing authority of a university. The provisions of the 1997 Universities Act relate to several specific third level institutions and, as the question posed by the Deputy does not refer to any specific institution, I am not in a position to say whether the provisions cover the situation as outlined in the query.</P>
        <P>However, I have asked my officials to contact the Deputy directly so that it can be clarified whether the query refers to a particular institution. Once this clarification has been made, a response can be provided to the Deputy. In general terms, the following sections of the 1997 Universities Act, among others, relate to the subject matter of the Deputy&rsquo;s question. Section 18(<i>c</i>) confers upon universities the power to make statutes governing their operation, subject to their charters. Section 26 allows for dispute resolution mechanisms to be agreed, and this entails consultation with the students&rsquo; union. Section 31 outlines a range of possible rights and responsibilities which may be included in a university&rsquo;s charter.</P>

Furthermore, where eligible pupils attend a school at a centre other than the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live, they may be allowed the concession of transport from the catchment boundary of the centre attended, provided there are seats for them on a bus serving that centre.</P>
        <P>Having considered the distances involved to the pick-up point for the children involved and the fact that some of the children are living outside of the catchment area concerned, the Department is satisfied that a re-routing of the bus service could not be justified in this case.</P>

If an individual applicant considers that she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she may appeal to the relevant VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant VEC, and remains of <Col N="1213"/>the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to the Department.

	<P>Delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, which will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year, aims to ensure the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education, three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan will involve an additional annual investment of approximately &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key element of the plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis process is being managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Science. This process is being assisted by an advisory group, and will be supported by quality <Col N="1214"/>assurance work co-ordinated through the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate. Information available from other sources, for example, areas selected for inclusion in RAPID, will also be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town schools and 300 rural schools, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support programme. The programme will bring together, and build upon, several existing interventions for schools and school clusters/communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. It is anticipated that the identification process will be completed by the end of 2005.</P>

	<P>In April 2005, I announced Government approval for the establishment of a multi-annual strategic innovation fund, which aims to encourage reform and capacity building within the higher education sector, in accordance with the recent recommendations of the OECD.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I am very committed to supporting the use of ICT in higher education, I particularly welcome reform within the higher education sector which aims to introduce teaching and learning reforms, including enhanced teaching methods, programme re-structuring, modularisation and e-learning.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the fund will be competitively awarded on the basis of an independent external evaluation of the quality of proposals, with a requirement for excellence. This draws on the successful principles established for the awarding of funding under the programme for research in third level institutions. Where the programme supports the development of an infrastructure for excellence in research, this fund will support enhanced capacity in the core teaching and learning function in all areas of the remit of the higher education institutions. The fund will only be allocated to institutions to the extent that the proposals received meet the standard required and achieve the outcomes to which they are committed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fund will be created on a multi-annual basis. I have asked the Higher Education Authority to immediately proceed with developing detailed criteria and launching a competitive process for the approval of funding awards, with a view to the drawdown of awards commencing in <Col N="1215"/>2006. The fund will be structured to ensure current national objectives are adequately reflected. I have previously identified these objectives as including the need to safeguard and reinforce the many roles of higher education, and the full diversity of disciplines within it, in driving economic development, in providing independent intellectual insights and in contributing to our broader social and cultural understanding.</P>
        <P>In September 2005, the chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority signed a memorandum of co-operation with the director of the joint information systems committee of the UK, which has responsibility for e-learning developments there. This is designed to foster and enhance co-operation in this area. The Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s e-learning strategy is based on meeting the greater diversity of student needs; increasing flexibility of provision; enhancing the capacity for integrating study with work and leisure through work-based and home-based learning. The authority is aware of the sizeable e-learning industry in Ireland and the opportunities this presents. It is keen to develop co-operation with IDA Ireland and the industry to make Ireland a centre for excellence in e-learning.</P>

	<P>The Department of Education and Science makes a specific <i>ex quota</i> allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to schools in the second level system. This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year. As a result of my decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005, an enhanced guidance allocation provision was put in place for 2005-2006 school year. This enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the free education/block grant schemes, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In addition certain schools had previously been allocated hours in response to particular needs or as part of the guidance enhancement initiative. These schools have been permitted to retain this higher allocation for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools outside the free education/block grant schemes, 11 hours per <Col N="1216"/>week are allocated in respect of schools in the 350 &mdash; 499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils.</P>
        <P>There are 681 whole-time equivalent guidance posts allocated to second level schools. All schools in the free education/block grant schemes receive an allocation for guidance. There are nine fee-charging post-primary schools, 1.2%, whose pupil enrolment is below 350 and, therefore, do not receive an allocation for guidance.</P>

An initial application for additional accommodation, to include several specialist rooms, an administration area, a general purpose/dining area and servery, storage areas and a physical education hall, was received from the management authority of the school in question. Subsequently the school submitted an application for funding towards the provision of six small rooms in temporary accommodation for special needs education.</P>
        <P>The overall accommodation needs of the school are being examined in the Department to ensure any capital funding being provided is appropriate to meet the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs.

	<P Just="Left">There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for second level schools in recent years. In addition to the increases in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant that now stands at &euro;286 per pupil from January last, voluntary secondary schools have benefited additionally by the introduction of grants under <Col N="1217"/>the school services support initiative. The standard support services grant that was increased to &euro;103 from January 2005, was increased further to &euro;145 per pupil in the case of voluntary secondary schools. This increased grant of &euro;42 per pupil is paid in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554, &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by the Department of Education and Science on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established junior certificate, leaving certificate, repeat leaving certificate and transition year programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the leaving certificate, vocational programme, post leaving certificate courses and leaving certificate applied. There have been significant improvements in the pupil teacher ratio at post-primary level in recent years. In 1997-98, there was one teacher for every 16 pupils. For the school year 2004-05, the pupil teacher ratio has fallen to 13.4:1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has also been enormous progress made over several years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second level, there are approximately 1,614 whole time equivalent teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares with approximately 558 teachers that were in place in the 2001-2002 school year for such pupils. In addition, there are 1,023 whole time equivalent special needs assistants in second level schools compared with 292 in the 2001-2002 school year.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, aims to ensure the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build upon, several existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>At second level, this new standardised system for identifying disadvantage in schools will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. As a result, some 150 second level schools that will be included in a new school support programme will benefit from additional staffing and funding supports including increased funding under the school book grant scheme, access to home school community liaison scheme services, access to a range of supports, both academic and non-academic, to retain young <Col N="1218"/>people in school. These measures will be extended to second level schools in the school support programme on a phased basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools represent a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>Since 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special education needs organisers, is responsible for processing any application for additional special educational needs resources. The recruitment, employment and dismissal of individual special need assistants are matters for each school authority. In terminating a special need assistant&rsquo;s contract of employment, the provisions of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 to 2001 should be applied. A special needs assistant who is in service for a period of between 13 weeks and two years should be given a minimum of one week&rsquo;s notice in accordance with the terms of the Act. Employees may be required to work the notice period or may accept payment in lieu of notice, if offered.</P>
        <P>In the case in question, the special needs assistant concerned was given notice on 28 October 2005. She will, however, continue to be paid on my Department&rsquo;s payroll up to and including 6 November 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 604 to 606, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, issued annually to all primary schools. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. The staffing schedule refers to the allocation of mainstream teaching posts in addition to a principal. In the case of smaller schools, the principal has a class teaching role. Accordingly, in the case of most smaller schools the actual class size is less than 29 pupils.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-2004 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996/97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-1997 school year to a projected 17.1:1 in 2004-2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitment of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities. Providing for children with special educational needs, there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools will result in reduced class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment <Col N="1221"/>of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

        <P>At an extraordinary general meeting of ITE, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law.

        <P Just="Left">My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute, and has been working closely with the liquidator since his appointment in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance. A number of ITE staff have been redeployed to date and options that may be available for remaining staff continue to be explored by my Department. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate re-deployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of legal issues in relation to the liquidation of ITE and the liquidator is progressing these matters. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on these issues. There are also a number of ongoing projects and publications to be finalised in ITE. As part of the completion of the liquidation process the liquidator is also progressing these matters.</P>

	<P>The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. The school in question was listed in my announcement of April this year as a project to progress through architectural planning up to pre-tender stage, that is up to and including advanced architectural planning.</P>
        <P>Following the announcement in April this year, my Department&rsquo;s planning section undertook a review of the school&rsquo;s enrolment and revised it upwards to 800 pupils. The school was informed of this in August 2005. In September 2005 updated schedules of accommodation, to accommodate the increased long-term enrolment, were issued to the school for their acceptance or comments, as well as a request to submit an addendum to the stage one submission based on the <Col N="1224"/>revised schedules and a number of observations from my Department&rsquo;s technical staff on the original submission.</P>
        <P>The school authorities accepted these schedules in October 2005 and the addendum to the stage one submission is still awaited. When this is received and reviewed the school building section will be in further contact with the school authorities advising them on how to proceed.</P>

	<P>My Department deals with the non-formal education of Ireland&rsquo;s young people and provides support by way of financial and other assistance to those organisations providing youth work programmes and services. The funding available meets the costs of direct support for national voluntary youth organisations and a number of related activities which include special projects for youth, particularly in disadvantaged areas, youth information services and grants to local youth groups and clubs.</P>
        <P>My Department does not operate a scheme of capital funding for youth clubs or youth organisations. The local youth club grant scheme makes provision for the support of youth work activities at local level. These grants are made available to youth clubs and groups through the Vocational Educational Committees, in this instance, County Dublin VEC. The scheme is open to all those involved in the provision of youth work services at a local level and is allocated in line with the priorities within those areas and within the overall financial resources available for the scheme.</P>
        <P>Grants are grouped under two headings, namely youth grants designed to aid the ongoing costs of youth clubs and groups and special youth grants of a once-off nature intended to aid special youth work initiatives.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy has made an application for capital funding towards the provision of additional accommo<Col N="1225"/>dation. An upward trend in enrolments in recent years necessitated a review of enrolment and demographic trends to ensure that any capital funding being provided is appropriate to meet the school&rsquo;s long term accommodation needs. This review is currently underway and officials will be in contact with the school authority in this regard. The project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-2009.</P>

	<P>The specific information requested in relation to class size at post primary is not readily available within my Department. However, in relation to teacher allocations for second level schools the following is the general position.</P>
        <P>Allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established junior certificate, leaving certificate, repeat leaving certificate and transition year programmes and a <Col N="1230"/>ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the leaving certificate vocational programme, post-leaving certificate courses and leaving certificate applied. Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at post-primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.4:1 in the 2004-05 school year. The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>

	<P>The first millennium development goal to which the Deputy refers concerns the elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education. I am committed to promoting and sustaining full compliance with gender equality legislation throughout the education system. A gender equality unit was established in the Department in 2000, and became fully operational in 2001. One of the main functions of the gender equality unit is to co-ordinate and monitor the process of mainstreaming a gender perspective into all areas of the education system. Gender mainstreaming involves actively and openly taking into account, at the planning stage, possible effects of policies or measures on the respective situation of men and women. The unit has also commissioned research into a range of areas related to gender and education. This research will add to our understanding of gender issues in the education sector, thus enabling the development of more informed and effective policy.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, the gender equality unit has funded a wide range of resource materials for students and teachers at primary and post-primary levels. Most recently it has produced a CD ROM and textbook on &ldquo;Discovering Women in Irish History&rdquo; and a resource pack for civic, social and political education called &ldquo;VOTE: Exploring Democracy, Equality, Participation and Elections&rdquo;. The unit is currently finalising &ldquo;Equal Measures&rdquo;, a resource developed for <Col N="1232"/>primary schools to help teachers, parents, pupils, the school community and boards of management in formulating a gender equality policy and in promoting gender equality in primary schools.</P>
        <P>The second millennium development goal to which the Deputy refers is that of ensuring that all boys and girls complete a full course of primary schooling. The current system provides for free and compulsory primary education for all children. Within the context of this provision, a range of supports is provided to ensure that children complete their primary education. Since 1997, the Government has dramatically increased the number of teachers in our primary schools. More than 4,500 additional teachers, including nearly 2,500 resource teachers, have been employed. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>We are currently providing increased resources for schools in disadvantaged areas to improve their school completion rates by offering extra supports for their students. These include extra educational supports and services in-school, after school and during holiday times. Working with parents to promote school attendance is also an important part of the work of the home school community liaison co-ordinators appointed to our disadvantaged schools.</P>
        <P>Other measures designed to improve school completion include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002. The priority the Government attaches to tackling early school leaving is evident from the fact that the budget for the welfare board has been increased by 20% in 2005. In addition, &euro;24 million is being provided this year for the school completion programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS or delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which will be introduced on a phased basis starting during the current school year, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education, that is from three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan will involve an additional annual investment of some &euro;40m on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban and 300 rural, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support <Col N="1233"/>programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters and communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. Under DEIS, additional clusters will be created under the school completion programme which provides a wide range of targeted supports on an individual and group basis to children and young people who may be at risk of early school leaving. We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the recent Oireachtas joint committee report on volunteers and volunteering in Ireland which recommends that transition year should strongly promote projects which involve a core element of volunteering. The transition year programme is a one-year optional programme, taken by some 24,000 students annually, which provides a bridge between junior and senior cycle. Its aim is to promote the personal, social, educational and vocational development of students and prepare them for their role as autonomous, participative and responsible members of society. Work experience and community involvement tend to be key components of transition year programmes since these activities can contribute enormously to heightening students&rsquo; social awareness and their sense of responsibility as well as encouraging self-directed learning, personal development and maturity. Through these activities, the transition year can act as a powerful catalyst for developing a real partnership with the local community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The planning of curriculum content for the transition year is the responsibility of the individual school having regard to guidelines issued by my Department. In establishing its curriculum, schools should take into consideration the possibilities offered by employers, other work-providing agencies and community-based initiatives along with the wider interests and needs of the local community. The transition year programme&rsquo;s guidelines for schools issued by my Department state:</P>
        <P Just="Left" LI="1">&ldquo;experience in any of the community/care services would be relevant as an element of preparation for adult life. Services such as those concerned with social, economic, physical, sensory and mental disabilities, and for special groups such as children, the chronically ill and the aged are most appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition these guidelines state: &ldquo;It is intended that the transition year should create opportunities to vary the learning environment and to dispel the notion that learning is something that happens only, or even most effectively in the classroom.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>When considering volunteerism among transition year students, the young social innovators <Col N="1235"/>programme is particularly relevant. This is an exciting and challenging opportunity for young people together with their teachers in transition year, to engage in social awareness education and social action at local level. It is now a nationwide initiative that is open to all schools in the country that have a transition year programme. To date, young social innovators across the country have been involved in numerous community projects including setting up a youth club where none existed, making playground equipment for pupils of a special school, making buildings more wheelchair-accessible, building a portion of a school in India and setting up an intergenerational social initiative in a town. These projects fit in very well with the young social innovators&rsquo; vision that &ldquo;Every young person has the ability to be a social innovator, to create change in how we live, think and care for others in the community and to shape the future fabric of society&rdquo;.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.8- ?>
        <P>Also relevant is Gaisce, the national challenge award given by the President to young people in Ireland between the ages of 15 and 25, which forms part of many transition year programmes in schools across Ireland. Community involvement, for example working with the elderly, forms part of this challenge.</P>
        <P>In its study of transition year in schools, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, found that 76%, the vast majority, of schools offered civic and social studies. In many cases, this included voluntary activity, charity work and community action programmes. I am very supportive of fostering volunteerism among students and I believe that transition year programmes in our schools are making a significant contribution in this regard. Higher education plays an important role in terms of personal development. Individuals who participate in higher education should be enriched by that experience. This enrichment occurs in a variety of ways, such as the acquisition of new knowledge, the development of skills and competencies and the exposure to new opportunities that foster personal development. Higher education is about developing individuals to their fullest potential and equipping them with the depth of skills necessary to enhance their life chances and contribute fully to society. For the nation, the social and cultural returns from higher education are just as important and valuable as the economic returns.</P>
        <P>Volunteering activities provide students with important opportunities to further foster their own personal development, become more aware of civic and social responsibilities and ultimately enrich their higher education experience. These are valuable skills that will be carried with them throughout their lives. In relation to the establish<Col N="1236"/>ment of volunteering centres on the campuses of higher education institutions, I am aware that there is already considerable such activity taking place. All higher education institutions have a significant number of clubs and societies including charitable organisations that provide students with considerable opportunity to participate in volunteering activities. I do not have exact statistics on the numbers of such clubs and societies or on the size of their student membership.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for special needs supports including access to special needs assistance, SNA, supports. The SENO will consider the application and where the care needs of the pupil have been clearly identified in a professional report and the criteria for the allocation of such support as outlined in circular 07/02 is met, the support will be granted and the school will be informed of the decision. The parents will also be notified by either the principal or the principal and the SENO. The support may be granted on an individual or shared basis depending on the care needs of the child. It is envisaged that each decision will be reviewed at least on a yearly basis but it may be reviewed in a shorter timeframe if necessary, for example if additional relevant information is made available.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>A written response was issued by my Department to a query raised by North Tipperary VEC, the relevant awarding body in this case, in with regard to the grant applicant referred to by the Deputy. The applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for grant assistance will be assessed with reference to the terms and conditions of funding, prescribed under the relevant maintenance grant scheme, and the clarification received from my Department to the query raised. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

	<P>In the 2003-2004 school year the average class size in ordinary classes in ordinary primary schools in Tipperary North was 22.8 while in Tipperary South the average was 23.0. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary <Col N="1238"/>level refers to the 2003-2004 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-1997. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers such as resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-1997 school year to 17.1:1, projected, in 2004-2005.</P>
        <P>Over 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities. With regard to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, entitled DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools. This action plan will result in reduced class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

        <P>However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional <Col N="1239"/>funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The amount provided in 2005 was &euro;81,133. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process. In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, I as Minister am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>Applying this provision to the development of multi-denominational education, at primary level my Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post-primary level, the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through non-designated vocational education committee schools. To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster &mdash; such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band 1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable. These measures are a strong indication of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do so as part of its own statutory obligations and in the context of the national development plan which is structured to support the development of all educational sectors regardless of ethos.</P>

	<P>Appointments to State boards are in the first instance subject to the relevant legislation. The overriding requirement in the appointment process is that nominees will have the capacity to contribute effectively to the work of the boards on the basis of their knowledge and expertise in the relevant area. As a matter of general practice, my Department would not hold personal information on members of boards, including whether or not a person had a disability.</P>
        <P>In respect of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the relevant legislation requires that &ldquo;the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of there being among those appointed as members of the Council persons who themselves have special educational needs&rdquo;. Two persons who were appointed to the NCSE when established in 2003 had disabilities. Vacancies exist in respect of those two positions and I will have regard to the above requirement in the replacement process.</P>

        <P>The Deputy should note that the data presented are based on applications from civil servants opting for Athlone as a first choice made before the priority deadline of 7 September 2004 and new recruits from the Public Appointments Service opting for Athlone. It excludes applicants with Athlone as a second to tenth choice, applications received after the 7 September 2004 deadline and applicants who have declined an offer of Athlone and applicants from organisations in the wider public service. My Department is progressing the offers of decentralisation to Athlone in accordance with agreements negotiated by the Department of Finance with staff representative bodies holding recognition for Civil Service administrative grades. When all first choice applicants for Athlone have been processed, my Department will contact the Public Appointments Service to request it to contact applicants with Athlone as a second to tenth choice.</P><Col N="1241"/>

	<P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post-leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for post-leaving certificate courses 2005, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2005-06 academic year. Under clause 3.2 of the PLC scheme candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC level 5 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC &mdash; NCVA &mdash; level 2 qualification, or FETAC level 6 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC &mdash; NCVA &mdash; level 3 qualification, or a third level qualification at level 6 or higher.</P>
        <P>However, notwithstanding this condition candidates who already hold a FETAC level 5 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC &mdash; NCVA &mdash; level 2 qualification, and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid. The candidate to whom the Deputy refers, already holds a FETAC level 5 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC &mdash; NCVA &mdash; level 2 qualification. As outlined above, the candidate is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of another course at FETAC level 5. I regret the news is not better for this student, but the Deputy will appreciate that the terms of <Col N="1242"/>the schemes are of general application and it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the scheme and make exceptions in individual cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading has been given a very high priority by my Department. As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the new general allocation system last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as specific learning disability, dyslexia and children with learning support needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with learning support and special educational needs. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs, including with dyslexia. Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such <Col N="1243"/>children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations. Each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of fewer than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on post-leaving certificate programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more receive a full learning support post. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, an official of the National Council for Special Education, for additional teaching support or special needs assistant support for the pupil.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 531 remedial or learning support teachers, 689 guidance posts and 1,599 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place at post-primary level. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local SENO directly for this support. Since the task force on dyslexia reported in 2001, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia, including the introduction of an on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia, the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia, and the development in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland of an information resource on dyslexia which is available in CD-ROM, DVD and video format.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. This grant helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public and assists in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand rep<Col N="1244"/>resent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the centre referred to by the Deputy and I understand that it is a privately funded organisation, headquartered in the United States of America with a branch in Belfast. I am not aware of any similar organisation in the State or of any demand for the services provided by the organisation, so I do not propose to comment further on it.</P>

	<P>The board of management of a school is primarily responsible for the recruitment and appointment of teachers. A principal is appointed by open competition. With effect from 31 May 2005, a primary school advertising a principal teacher vacancy is required either to place a full advertisement in a national newspaper in accordance with appendix D of the handbook, Boards of Management of National Schools &mdash; Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure, or place the advertisement on <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i> and a short notice in a national newspaper indicating that the post is advertised on this website. The board of management must also notify the teaching staff of the school of the vacancy. The selection board for the appointment of a principal <Col N="1246"/>teacher comprises the chairperson of the board of management and at least two independent assessors to be appointed by the patron after consultation with the chairperson.</P>
        <P>Class teachers are appointed in the first instance from the redeployment panel for the area in which the school is located. If this panel is not in operation, a permanent or long-term teaching vacancy is filled by open competition. The selection board for the post of permanent or long-term temporary teacher comprises the chairperson of the board of management, the principal teacher and an independent assessor appointed by the patron after consultation with the chairperson. The chairperson may disqualify himself or herself from the selection board if a relationship exists between him or her and any applicant for the post. The patron will then nominate a replacement in his or her place and is required to inform the primary administration section of my Department prior to the interviews.</P>
        <P>A selection board should establish criteria for the assessment of the applications. Having completed the interviews, the selection board submits a written report to the board of management nominating the applicant whom it considers most suitable for the appointment. A list in order of merit of other candidates who are deemed suitable is retained by the selection board for use in the event of the post not being filled by that nominee. The board of management appoints the nominated teacher unless it has good and sufficient reason not to do so, in which instance the matter shall be referred to the patron, whose decision in this matter shall be accepted by the board. The chairperson should seek the approval of the patron for the appointment.</P>
        <P>Both the successful candidate and the chairperson complete a teacher appointment form which is forwarded to the primary payments section of my Department to allow salary to be issued to the successful applicant. When this form is received in primary payments, in the case of permanent appointments, a letter of sanction of the appointment will issue to the board of management. On receipt of this sanction, the board shall then enter into the appropriate agreement with the teacher.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that my Department&rsquo;s function is to ensure that the appointment is warranted by reference to the staffing schedule, to ensure that the person being appointed is qualified for the post and to ensure that the agreed appointment procedures have been followed. The details regarding the appointment of teachers and principals are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s publications, Appointment of Principals, Permanent &amp; Temporary Teachers, and, Boards of Management of National Schools &mdash; Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure. These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie.</i></P>

	<P>Under section 14 of the Education Act 1998 it is the duty of a patron, for the purposes of ensuring that a recognised school is managed in a spirit of partnership, to appoint, where practicable, a board of management. The patron is responsible for initiating the steps necessary for the establishment of the board in accordance with the procedures set out in the handbook, Boards of Management of National Schools &mdash; Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure.</P>
        <P>When the process for the election or nomination of persons to the board is complete, the patron formally appoints the board of management and appoints one of the members as chairperson of the board. The patron communicates the names of the chairperson and the other members of the board to the Minister and confirms that the appointment of the members conforms to the procedures and requirements set out in the handbook. Except where the Minister communicates to the contrary, within ten days of receipt of this information, the board is deemed to be recognised and assumes office forthwith.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme for primary school building works, a grant of &euro;440,000 was sanctioned to enable the management authorities of the school in question to provide additional accommodation. The initiative allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project. The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding <Col N="1248"/>envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>
        <P>An appeal for additional funding has been received from the school referred to by the Deputy. The appeal will be examined and a decision conveyed to the school management as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>There has been enormous progress made over recent years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>At second level, there are approximately 1,580 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares with approximately 200 teachers who were in place in the 1997-1998 school year for such pupils.</P>
        <P>On the capital side, under the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects, the provision of specialist accommodation for children with special needs attracts a band 1 rating. This is the highest rating possible which is indicative of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that where accommodation needs are identified, these are addressed in the shortest timeframe possible.</P>
        <P>I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

        <P>There has been enormous progress made over recent years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support.

This compares with approximately 200 teachers who were in place in the 1997-1998 school year for such pupils. Enormous progress has also been made in relation to increasing the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. At this stage there are approximately 6,650 whole-time equivalent SNAs in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs. The National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special educational needs organisers, is responsible for processing any applications for additional SNA support that may be received by it from schools.</P>
        <P>I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, which is issued annually to all primary schools. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 243 pupils at 30 September 2004. The school also has one permanent learning support-resource post, one permanent special class post, one temporary language support post and the services of a learning support-resource post based in the school. To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02, which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. Officials from my Department visited the school in question in June of this year to carry out a technical inspection of the existing accommodation and to assess the needs of the pupils attending the school. The school authorities have embarked on a major redevelopment programme, which is currently at a very early design stage. They are assessing the needs into the future of the residents with special needs on the campus and outreach facilities and the many support services and industries around them.</P>
        <P>The school&rsquo;s design team is currently preparing a development control plan for the site, of which this school forms part and my Department is awaiting its response before the project can proceed further. In the meantime, a member of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate has drafted a schedule <Col N="1256"/>of overall accommodation to reflect the current educational needs of the pupils attending the school.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659 and 687 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Sallins, Naas and Kill, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas. At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corb&aacute;in, St. Conleth&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been approved at Caragh national school, St. Corban&rsquo;s, Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na Riogh in Naas and Scoil Naomh Brighde.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A brand new state-of-the-art 16 classroom school together with a double autistic unit was opened this September in Naas town. This project will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas. Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s national school and Two Mile House national school. The long-term accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and Convent of Mercy in Naas are also currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick&rsquo;s post-primary school, County Kildare VEC, is currently progressing plans to relocate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupils. Additionally, an extension project is under construction at St. Mary&rsquo;s College, which will increase capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id Ris and further accommodation needs at the school are currently in planning. At <Col N="1257"/>Sallins national school, a seven classroom extension is under construction. When completed, this extension will increase capacity from nine classrooms to 16 classrooms. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms is being allowed into architectural planning this year.</P>
        <P>Regarding Kill, the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department concerning site acquisitions generally, is continuing in consultation with the local authority to explore all possibilities in respect of the acquisition of a site for a new 16 classroom national school in Kill. Every effort is being made to ensure that a site is acquired as soon as possible. All of these initiatives represent significant capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review going forward to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 660 and 666 to 669, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has dramatically increased the number of teachers in our schools. At primary level, more than 4,500 additional teachers, including nearly 2,500 resource teachers, have been employed. At post-primary level, approximately 1,900 additional teaching posts have been allocated during this period. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school, including resource and learning support teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to a projected 17.1:1 in 2004-05 at primary level and from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year at post-primary level. At primary level, average class size has been reduced from 26.6 in 1996-97 to 23.9 in 2003-04. Significantly smaller classes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break &mdash; Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS. The plan, which will be introduced on a phased basis starting during the current school year aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education &mdash; three to 18 years &mdash; from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and will involve an additional annual investment of some &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of approximately 300 additional posts across the education system <Col N="1259"/>generally. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Regarding providing for children with special educational needs, there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. Significant progress has also been made in respect of increasing the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, in our schools who specifically cater for the care needs of children with special educational needs. At this stage, there are approximately 6,650 whole-time equivalent SNAs in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by the Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, the Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities that wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>Improvements have been made under various schemes in recent years. In 1999, an ex-quota allocation was made to all second level schools in the free education scheme in respect of remedial education and the home-school-community liaison scheme was extended to all schools designated disadvantaged. In 2000, a decision was made to reduce the general pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1 and additional posts were also provided for leaving certificate applied, junior certificate programme and the guidance enhancement initiative resulting in approximately 1,000 additional posts in the sector.</P>
        <P>The number of teaching posts allocated to cater for pupils with special educational needs has increased from 559 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, in 2001-02 to 1,599 WTEs in the current school year. The number of teaching posts allocated to schools to cater for non-national pupils with significant English language deficits has also increased from 113 WTEs in 2001-02 to 242 WTEs in the current school year. In addition, the Department has provided for an additional allocation of 100 posts to guidance from September 2005. I am confident that, with this significant investment, schools throughout the country, including those in the areas referred to by the <Col N="1260"/>Deputy, will be in a position to meet their pupils&rsquo; needs.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the maintenance of schools is a matter for the managerial authorities. My Department issued each school with a maintenance manual in 1998 and boards were exhorted to adopt a proactive approach to maintenance. <i>Per capita</i> grants towards the operating costs of primary and voluntary secondary schools may be used for maintenance purposes. <i>Per capita</i> grants have been increased significantly in recent years. In addition, primary schools are given an <Col N="1261"/>annual allocation of &euro;3,809 plus &euro;12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works. This allocation must be spent on the physical infrastructure of the school or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use.</P>
        <P>Works covered include improvements to school buildings and grounds &mdash; items such as the replacement of windows, roof repairs, resurfacing of school yards, repainting and redecorating qualify under this heading &mdash; improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment and the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds. If there are no outstanding works under any of the above headings that need to be carried out under this scheme, the school may expend funds on items of equipment for use solely by the school, such as computers, overhead projectors and photocopiers.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, which is issued annually to all primary schools. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal and 21 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 588 pupils on 30 September 2004. The school also has three permanent learning support resource posts, two permanent special class posts and two temporary language support posts. To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 678 and 729 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The information regarding the pupil-teacher ratio in individual schools is not readily available in my Department. Since 1997, the Government has dramatically increased the number of teachers in our schools. At primary level more then 4,500 additional teachers, including approximately 2,500 resource teachers, have been employed. At post-primary level approximately 1,900 additional teaching posts have been allocated during this period. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The pupil-teacher ratio, based on all teachers in a school including resource and learning support teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to a projected 17.1:1 in 2004-05 at primary level, and from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year at post-primary level. At primary level the average class size has been reduced from 26.6 in 1996-97 to 23.9 in 2003-04.</P><Col N="1264"/>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. More than 5,000 teachers now work directly with children with special needs in our primary schools, including those requiring learning support. This compares to less than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers now works specifically with children with special needs. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 682 and 730 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school planning section of my Department is responsible for planning the provision of suitable cost effective accommodation both in response to applications from school managerial authorities for accommodation and by analysis of changing demographics. All resultant projects, whether extensions to existing schools or new schools, are prioritised by reference to published criteria which were revised last year in consultation with the education partners. These criteria are structured to ensure that schools most in need of accommodation are assigned a band 1 priority rating. To date this has been reflected in the pub<Col N="1265"/>lication of the multi-annual capital programme and that will continue in the future.</P>
        <P>To ensure speed in delivering projects, initiatives such as the devolved building initiative for small schools and the permanent accommodation initiative, both introduced in 2003, were expanded in 2004 and 2005. These demonstrate the Department&rsquo;s commitment to find innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. These schemes fund schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. They involve minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that these initiatives will inform future policy in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Individual school management authorities are not required to report to my Department on incidences of bullying. Therefore, the information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department. I can assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multi-faceted strategy to tackle the issue. Educating both primary and post-primary students on anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills includ<Col N="1266"/>ing self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the &ldquo;Myself and Others&rdquo; strand from infant classes onwards. At second level, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the &ldquo;Belonging and Integrating&rdquo; module.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools provides a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>

Approximately 6,650 whole-time equivalent SNAs work in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.

I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department actively encourages the uptake of science and technological subjects through an ongoing programme of curriculum reform and teacher in-service and by upgrading school facilities. A new science curriculum was introduced into primary schools in 2000 as part of the revised primary school curriculum. Revised syllabi in junior certificate science and in leaving certificate physics, chemistry and biology have also been introduced since then. The introduction of these syllabi was supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers. Work by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on the revision of the two remaining leaving certificate science subjects, agricultural science and combined physics and chemistry, is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>The introduction of science at primary level was supported by a resource grant of &euro;1,000 per school plus &euro;10 per pupil. Additional equipment grants were provided to schools at post-primary level, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing schools building programme. In that context, &euro;16 million was provided to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
        <P>Following a review by the NCCA of existing technological subjects at leaving certificate level, four syllabi were submitted to my Department for consideration. These are engineering technology, formerly engineering, architectural technology, formerly construction studies, design and communication graphics, formerly technical drawing, and a new syllabus for technology which is available only to junior certificate at present. My Department is developing proposals to secure a commitment to a multi-annual funding package which will enable the revised syllabi to be implemented at the earliest possible date.</P><Col N="1268"/>
        <P>In response to a request from my Department, the NCCA is conducting a review of mathematics at post-primary level. A key component of this is a public consultation process, which has just begun. The 2002 report of the task force on the physical sciences highlighted the importance of addressing the decline in the numbers of students participating in physics and chemistry at senior cycle and choosing science options in higher education, and set out a range of strategies and actions to address these issues. The report contains 39 recommendations, with costed proposals totalling &euro;244 million, of which &euro;66.3 million would be a recurring annual cost. My Department is progressing these recommendations as resources permit, in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. To date, progress has been made on 25 of the recommendations.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, it is proposed that a double autism unit will be established at the school in question. In this regard, appropriate classroom accommodation has been provided in the school for this purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My officials have been liaising with the school authorities for some time in relation to the resources to be made available to facilitate the operation of the classes. My Department has confirmed that the classes will be capable of catering for up to 12 pupils with autism at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. In addition, two full-time special needs assistants, SNAs, will be allocated to each class. Additional SNAs for the classes may be considered on the basis of the individual assessed needs of the pupils enrolled.</P>
        <P>The school authorities submitted a request to my Department for resources over and above those generally provided to schools when establishing such classes. A number of meetings have taken place between the school and officials from my Department with a view to resolving the issues raised by the school. The latest of these meetings took place on 2 June when three officials from my Department met the school&rsquo;s board of management.</P>
        <P>At that meeting it was agreed the board would consider the issues discussed and send its views in writing on those issues to the Department. My Department received a response earlier this month and is liaising with the Health Service Executive on the provision of therapeutic services before reverting to the school authority.</P>
        <P>The Department is extremely anxious that this purpose-built facility for children with autism would become operational as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and to put appropriate safeguards in place.</P>
        <P>It is open to school management authorities or individuals to make direct contact with the Health and Safety Authority on matters of concern to them and the Department would not necessarily be aware of such communications. Where they are issued, notifications from the Health and Safety Authority are sent to the management authorities of schools in the first instance.</P>
        <P>In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements. Provision is built into the school building programme to enable schools address urgent health and safety problems. Primary schools are given an annual allocation, currently amounting to &euro;3,809 plus &euro;12.70 per pupil, under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to school infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The summer works scheme was introduced during 2004 which provides capital grants for small scale refurbishment works at primary and post-primary schools. The level of funding that is provided is based on the cost estimate provided by the school&rsquo;s design team at application stage. Responsibility for the delivery of the projects is entirely devolved out to the schools and their design teams.</P>
        <P>The scope of works covered under this scheme is intended to address health and safety issues in all schools as well as improvement works to the existing fabric of the buildings. A total of &euro;31 million was spent in 2004 on 292 primary projects and 158 post-primary projects under this scheme. The 2005 programme provides for 452 primary school projects and 289 post-primary school projects that will be grant-aided at a total cost of <i>circa</i> &euro;70.5 million.</P>
        <P>The Department also sets aside a contingency sum each year to deal with emergency works in primary and post-primary schools, including health and safety works. Urgently required health <Col N="1274"/>and safety works relating to asbestos removal, radon mitigation or dust extraction may be grant-aided under the remediation programmes operated by the school building section of my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to the summer works scheme, I have made a number of announcements regarding the 2005 schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, &euro;270 million will be allocated to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.</P>
        <P>The new Schools Building and Modernisation Programme 2005-2009 will be underpinned not just by a significant increase in overall funding but by major improvements in the administration of the funding. Devolving more funding to local level through the summer works scheme and the small and rural schools initiative will allow schools to move ahead more quickly with smaller projects.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, my Department is currently engaged in the roll-out of broadband Internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three year &euro;18 million joint Government &mdash; IBEC-TIF fund. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process. A broadband support service is being provided by the NCTE to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.</P>
        <P>Following a public tendering process last year, contracts were awarded to six firms for the provision of access connectivity across the nearly 4,000 schools involved. These companies are Digiweb, Smart Telecom, Irish Broadband, BT Ireland, Last Mile and HS Data. The contract for the provision of a broadband router at school level, where appropriate, was awarded to Eircom. The roll-out process is now well under way and the schools national broadband network and the service desk have been established and are operational.</P>
        <P>As of 4 November 2005, the number of schools which have had their basic connectivity service <Col N="1275"/>installed was 1,886 and the number of schools which have had their router installed, either separately or as part of the basic connectivity service, was 880. In this regard, the satellite provision for 165 schools contains the necessary functionality and does not require the provision of a separate router. It is expected that the roll-out will be fully completed by March 2006.</P>

The school in question was listed in my announcement of April this year as a project to progress through architectural planning up to pre-tender stage, that is, up to and including advanced architectural planning. To bring this project to the required stage my Department&rsquo;s officials have requested and received various amendments to the stage 3 submission &mdash; detailed plans and costs &mdash; during the year. Most recently, my Department&rsquo;s officials wrote to the school authorities on 21 September with some further queries and a response has now been received. These will be examined as soon as possible and my officials will then be in further contact with the school authorities with regard to the next steps involved in progressing this building project. Progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-2009.</P>

	<P>Science and technology has a key role to play in supporting continued economic progress and development. Ireland is fortunate in the high number of students who have studied science and technology. OECD data for 2003 reveals that Ireland ranks fifth of 31 countries in the number of science graduates per 100,000 employed in the 25 to 34 age group. The downturn experienced in Ireland in the ICT sector, which was part of a worldwide recession, led to a significant decline in applications from students wishing to pursue studies in information technology. In the context of the Government&rsquo;s continuing policy to address future skills needs, the HEA has sought to assist higher education institutions to develop new courses to better meet the needs of both new students and existing employees in the ICT industry who wish to upskill.</P>
        <P>The ICT Ireland undergraduate internship programme is a major initiative launched by the HEA and ICT Ireland, the IBEC body representing the high-tech sector. This is an ICT industry-wide programme which will involve a two-day week placement for undergraduates in third and fourth year of specified ICT degree courses. This initiative is a prime opportunity for industry and the education sector to work together to provide high quality graduates.</P>
        <P>Coupled with these initiatives, third level institutions engage with industry representatives at national and regional levels to ensure that short-term and long-term skills needs in science and technology are identified and addressed. The discover science and engineering programme supported by my Department is carrying out important work in raising the profile of science and engineering careers and pointing out the opportunities available to prospective students.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to work closely with the expert group on future skills needs on developing national strategies to address the issue of skills needs, manpower estimating and training for enterprise. The group comprises a range of public and private sector enterprise interests, development agency and educational representatives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Aer Lingus and the Defence Forces are members of the public sector transfer scheme which provides for the reckoning by each participating organisation of earlier pensionable service with any other member of the transfer scheme. Participation in the scheme is voluntary and Aer Lingus decided to become a member of the scheme with effect from 1 June 1973. As a result, the company is obliged to reckon all prior pensionable service in the case of its employees who left other member organisations, including the Defence Forces, on or after that date and subsequently joined Aer Lingus. As a member of the scheme, Aer Lingus could also, on a purely voluntary basis, agree to reckon prior service in the case of its employees who left other member organisations prior to 1 June 1973. In the event, Aer Lingus exercised this voluntary option only in respect of former Defence Forces personnel who had service during the emergency period from 1939 to 1946 or the period 9 September 1968 to 31 May 1973. In this regard, Aer Lingus was approved on 9 September 1968 as a member of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963, which was the forerunner of the present transfer scheme.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are responsible, as part of their housing management functions, for the determination of rents of their dwellings, having regard to certain broad principles laid down by my Department in circular letters HRT 3/2002 and HMandAH 1/2004. The circulars ask local authorities to ensure that rent increases do not absorb an excessive amount of increases made for the benefit of persons who depend on social welfare payments and, in particular, on old age pension payments. As a general guideline, local authorities have been advised that no more than 15% of any increase in such pension income should be absorbed by an increase in rent.</P>
        <P>Local authorities were also advised to include provisions in their rent schemes for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>

	<P>I assume that the question refers to the Planning and Development Regulations 2005 which I made on 14 July 2005 following debate in both Houses. The regulations generally exempt peat extraction below a threshold of 10 hectares from the requirement for planning permission. However, there are exceptions where the peat extraction would have significant effects on the environment. In those limited cases, planning permission must be applied for, accompanied by an environmental impact statement. Where the peat extraction takes place within peatland areas that have been afforded protection either as special areas of conservation, SACs, or natural heritage areas, NHAs, those are subject to a separate control system which is unaffected by the change to the regulations.</P>

        <P>The most recent information from the central applications facility, CAF, indicates that there are a total of 59 staff available, including staff recruited for Waterford, in respect of the 225 posts to be decentralised to Waterford. My Department will be contacting those staff shortly with a view to agreeing arrangements for their transfer to the Department as soon as possible. My Department will also be contacting the CAF in due course for details of applicants who have applied for Waterford as a second or subsequent preference. The indicative timescale provided for the completion of office accommodation in <Col N="1286"/>Waterford is mid-2009, and the Office of Public Works is evaluating site options at present.</P>

	<P>The administration of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme is delegated to local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations. As far as is practicable, that is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level.</P>
        <P>The review of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme has involved an examination of the principal features of the scheme, including the question of means testing. In that regard, the extent to which means testing is already employed by some local authorities is being considered. The approaches of different local authorities have varied over time. In this context, authorities review their schemes on an ongoing basis to streamline their operation and have been introducing a variety of mechanisms to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need, including prioritisation on grounds of medical and financial need or cost control.</P>
        <P>While my Department is aware that several local authorities have regard to the financial capacity of applicants, it does not have detailed definitive information on a countrywide basis of the arrangements involved. On completion of the review it will be possible to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme to ensure that the funding available is directed at those persons in greatest need of such assistance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 750 and 751 together.</P>
        <P>My Department implements two priorities of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, ESIOP, of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the housing priority and the environmental infrastructure priority. The housing priority of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme sets out a seven-year programme of investment in housing. The priority is managed on a programme rather than a project basis and investment for the 2000 to 2004 period, at &euro;6.86 billion, was almost 8% ahead of NDP estimates at the end of 2004. At the end of June 2005, investment totalled &euro;7.34 billion.</P>
        <P>Detailed financial progress under the five measures that comprise the housing priority is set out in the following table.</P><Col N="1289"/>

        <P FLI="0">Investment in water services is covered by the environmental infrastructure priority. That priority is divided into five measures, four of which are implemented by this Department. The four water services infrastructure measures in this priority are implemented through the water services investment programme, WSIP. This is a three-year rolling programme intended to facilitate annual adjustment of priorities in response to emerging needs in a structured fashion. The current WSIP was rolled out in May 2004, covering the years 2004 to 2006, and contains 869 individual water and sewerage schemes at various stages of construction and planning.</P>
        <P>The initial programme complement contained individual targets relating to the number of schemes completed for each of the measures. A revised programme complement containing pro<Col N="1290"/>gress indicators reflecting (a) population equivalent, pe, served and (b) environmental targets attained will form the backdrop to future NDP reporting. At the end of June 2005, completed projects had generated an additional capacity of 3 million pe and an increase in water treatment capacity of 578,000 pe.</P>
        <P>The original financial allocations of the ESIOP environmental infrastructure priority in the national development plan published in 2000 totalled &euro;3.8 billion, broken down as follows: waste water measure &mdash;&euro;1.657 billion; water supply measure &mdash;&euro;579 million; management and rehabilitation measure &mdash;&euro;862 million; support for economic activity measure &mdash;&euro; 702 million.</P>
        <P>The revised programme complement envisages an outturn of &euro;3.1 billion rather than the original &euro;3.8 billion Exchequer expenditure and is gener<Col N="1291"/>ally in line with original projections. However, from an overall perspective, private and non-Exchequer expenditure has not materialised as envisaged.</P><Col N="1292"/>

        <P FLI="0">Reflecting the emphasis placed on the completion of major waste water projects during the early NDP period, spending on measure 1, waste water, is well ahead of forecast with the other water infrastructure measures behind forecast to varying degrees.</P>
        <P>A factor behind the underspend on measure 2 is that private capital investment for suitable projects has not been forthcoming regarding the &euro;127 million originally earmarked for financing from this source. In addition, the required level of local authority financial input into measure 3 has not materialised. In practice, the implementation of the polluter pays water pricing framework has to date yielded less capital investment than was estimated.</P>
        <P>The following is a summary of progress under the individual measures from January 2000 to June 2005. On measure 1, waste water schemes, cumulative expenditure has totalled &euro;1.756 billion &mdash; 121% of the original cumulative end-2005 forecast and 99% of the revised forecast. Some 96 schemes have been completed. The high rate of expenditure on this measure is reflected in the progress outlined above regarding compliance with the end-2005 requirements of the EU urban waste water treatment directive and the additional capacity provided.</P>
        <P>On measure 2, water supply schemes, cumulative expenditure has totalled &euro;308 million, 78% of the revised end-2005 forecast. Water supply schemes funded under this measure ensure a continuing high rate of compliance with national and EU requirements regarding drinking water quality and the availability of capacity to service economic and demographic expansion. A total of 44 schemes have been completed.</P>
        <P>On measure 3, the rehabilitation and management of infrastructure, cumulative expenditure has totalled &euro;169 million, 72% of the revised end-2005 forecast. A total of 19 schemes have been completed. The objective of this measure is to address the need for renewal and rehabilitation of <Col N="1292"/>local authority water distribution and waste water collection systems to improve overall efficiency.</P>
        <P>On measure 4, economic activity schemes, cumulative expenditure has totalled &euro;304 million &mdash; 89% of the revised forecast for end 2005. A total of 162 schemes, 139 serviced land initiative and 23 rural towns and villages initiative, have been completed. More than 75,000 sites have been provided under the serviced land initiative, with a further 94,000 sites at construction stage. Some 250,000 sites in all are expected to be provided under this initiative.</P>
        <P>More than 100 public private partnership, PPP, projects are at various stages in the water or waste water and housing sectors, primarily in the water or waste water sector. The water or waste water sector projects are design, build and operate projects and the expenditure on them is included in the relevant tables above. There are several design, build and finance PPPs for housing, such as Fatima Mansions and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens in Dublin which form part of the ESIOP and do not involve Exchequer expenditure.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that my Department is making good progress overall in meeting the budgetary and output targets associated with the implementation of measures contained in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme of the national development plan. Where specific measures are running below target, in particular, smaller water schemes operated by local authorities, steps are being taken by my Department to secure greater progress.</P>

From 1995, as a development of the scheme, specific provision was made for the first time for taking into account the market value of a site provided to the housing authority for a nominal sum. Between July 1973 and 1986 the purchase price of dwellings was based on the original all-in cost, updated to current money values by use of a CSO value-of-money table.</P>

	<P>The meeting in June 2005 was one of numerous meetings that have taken place between officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food with farming representatives. The purpose of those meetings was to agree management prescriptions for habitats of birds in the Shannon Callows special protection area and to assess losses and costs to landowners arising from the implementation of those prescriptions. Agreement would allow farmers, other than those who opt for the REP scheme, to be compensated by my Department for actual costs and losses arising from the implementation of the necessary management prescriptions. While it has not yet proved possible to resolve those matters fully, my Department is maintaining contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food and farming representatives to see how agreement might be finalised.</P>

The committee receives a briefing on progress in that regard at its quarterly meetings. The committee has been supplied with copies of the Department&rsquo;s decentralisation implementation plans. The committee noted that the plans, <i>inter alia</i>, identify the risks attendant on the decentralisation process and measures which are proposed to address those.</P>
        <P>The main risks identified at this stage relate to loss of knowledge arising from the anticipated significant high turnover of staff in all Dublin-based areas of the Department. Several mitigation strategies are in place or being developed to facilitate skills and knowledge transfer from existing staff to their replacements. Those strategies include the recruitment of new staff as early as possible, the phased transfer of existing <Col N="1295"/>staff out of the Department, the implementation of a comprehensive training and development plan and making available updated work guidelines and process maps. The committee will continue to review the risk management assessment of the decentralisation programme.</P>

	<P>A reed bed is a common term for various natural biological waste water treatment systems employing constructed wetlands. Constructed wetlands are, in appropriate circumstances, a suitable form of waste water treatment for small communities if properly designed, constructed, operated and maintained. In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency published a manual on treatment systems for small communities, business, leisure centres and hotels, which includes a section on constructed wetlands and sets out the advantages and disadvantages of such treatment systems as well as appropriate design, construction and maintenance criteria.</P>
        <P>The use of integrated constructed wetlands for waste water treatment and sustainable environmental management is a more recent initiative by my Department which includes an Ireland-Wales INTERREG project. That concept strives to replicate the wider range of ecological conditions typically found in natural wetlands. The larger land areas used, compared with most other reed beds or constructed wetland designs, make these integrated constructed wetlands more robust and sustainable and capable of dealing with larger waste water volumes. An interdisciplinary team is preparing a national guidance document to encourage wider use of the concept by providing <Col N="1296"/>the necessary guidance to regulators, designers and contractors.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s primary concern is to ensure that, when severe weather conditions arise, the local authorities are geared to respond promptly and effectively to offset the worst effects of these conditions. The Department reminds local authorities each year of the need to ensure that all necessary arrangements are in place to deal with severe weather conditions. This includes the need to revise and update, as necessary, their contingency plans for dealing with the consequences of severe weather conditions. Local authorities are also reminded to ensure that arrangements are in place to take necessary action arising from early warnings from Met &Eacute;ireann, the necessity to be proactive as regards public relations and information, and availability of equipment and stocks.</P>
        <P>When a severe weather alert is forecast, local authorities mobilise their emergency crews, all of which should be fully briefed and competent in responding to emergencies in their own areas of responsibility. Each local authority also has a <Col N="1298"/>major emergency plan which can be activated in the case of any emergency which is outside the scope of normal services to deal with. Local authority emergency telephone numbers are published in local newspapers and broadcast on local radio when appropriate.</P>
        <P>The maintenance of non-national roads, including measures to deal with the effects of severe weather conditions, is a matter for each individual local authority. To assist local authorities in this regard, the Department issued a detailed guidance memorandum on maintenance of essential services in severe weather conditions to local authorities in November 2000. The memorandum contains guidance for local authorities on a wide range of issues, including advice regarding snow clearance vehicles. The Department also reminds local authorities each year to ensure that winter road maintenance equipment is available for immediate use in all climate conditions and that snow clearance and salt spreading equipment is maintained in good working order. The most recent reminder to local authorities in this regard issued on 27 October this year.</P>

However, using data on the numbers of loans drawn down for new and second-hand houses, together with data on buyer status based on a voluntary statistical survey of mortgagees, there were over 240,000 first-time buyers during the period from 1998 to the first half of 2005.</P>

Data on the number of new houses completed indicate that almost 450,000 houses have been supplied in this period, 83,000 of which were in the Dublin area. As the data is based on profiling those taking out mortgages for house purchase purpose, it will not cover all purchases of new or secondhand houses. For instance, in 2004, it is estimated that approximately 35% of new houses were not mortgage financed.</P>

Detailed information on an individual local authority basis will be available in due course in the 2005 annual housing statistics bulletin.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place a number of new arrangements to facilitate the delivery of strong programmes of social and affordable housing. In consultation with the Department, local <Col N="1303"/>authorities have developed five year action plans for their social and affordable housing programmes covering the period to 2008.

	<P>In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges and waivers is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges. Traditionally waste management services have been provided at a local level with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances. The present legal framework reflects this.</P>

        <P>To encourage individuals to minimise their waste, all local authorities and private waste operators were asked to begin a switch to use-based charging arrangements from the start of this year. In support of this more proactive approach to the promotion of recycling, the Department continues to make a significant level of funding available to local authorities to <Col N="1304"/>increase the range of waste recycling infrastructure available to householders.</P>
        <P>In addition, local authorities have been asked to engage with commercial waste collectors with a view to agreeing on a scheduling of payments rather than a periodic lump sum payment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; manufacturers and importers &mdash; of farm plastics such as silage bale wrap and sheeting are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and it is a matter for the company, under the terms of this producer responsibility initiative and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, to set a rate of levy which will cover its operational costs.</P>
        <P>While responsibility for the collection and recovery of farm plastics rests with the compliance scheme, the Department monitors the <Col N="1305"/>scheme on an ongoing basis. Discussions are continuing involving the Department and IFFPG and other stakeholders to explore options for improvement to the scheme and resolution of outstanding issues.</P>

        <Quest>the implications for a previous submission made by his Department to Wicklow County Council with respect to the Blessington draft development plan in March-April 2003, following a report (details supplied); if he intends to put a preservation order on the area; if so, the extent of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Submissions by my Department to Wicklow County Council in 2003 on the draft Blessington area plan were made in the context of its role as prescribed body under the Planning and Development Acts in heritage issues. At the time, it was recommended that appropriate buffer zones should be provided to protect the monuments in the vicinity referred to in the question and that archaeological conditions should be attached to any further extractive works in that vicinity.</P>
        <P>My Department is also a statutory consultee in individual planning applications which may have <Col N="1307"/>an impact on the built or natural heritage. My Department received a copy of the planning application in question from Wicklow County Council and issued a response on 13 December 2004 recommending,<i> inter alia</i>, that permission should not be granted for the development unless the planning authority was satisfied that the archaeological heritage could be protected.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to give independent consideration of planning authorities&rsquo; decisions on planning applications in cases where such decisions are appealed to the board. In considering an appeal, the board must consider all submissions on the file, together with its own inspector&rsquo;s report and recommendation, and <Col N="1308"/>reach its own conclusion on the matter having regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the interests of the protection of archaeology and good regulatory practice, it is appropriate that the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004 and the Planning and Development Act 2000 should be operated in a co-ordinated way. Having regard to this consideration and to the circumstances of this case, including the provisions of the County Wicklow development plan 2004-10 and the recent decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the question of a preservation order does not arise at this time. However, I have not ruled out the potential use of a preservation order and I will be keeping the position under review.</P>
