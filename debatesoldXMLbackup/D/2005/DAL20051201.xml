    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent public matter: the necessity to halt the proposed poisonous incinerators at Ringaskiddy in County Cork and Carranstown in County Meath to preserve the health and environment of residents living in those areas and the necessity to discuss and work for the implementation of alternative methods of waste management that do not threaten the health of our people and damage our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the imminent closure of the Irish sugar beet industry and the impact it will have on more than 3,500 farm families, workers in Irish Sugar, contractors, hauliers and the economy as a whole; to debate the need for increased compensation for those who will see major losses in income as a result of the proposals agreed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the Council of Minister&rsquo;s meeting last week; to debate the need to provide alternatives in the event of the proposals as put forward being implemented in full and the future of agriculture in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the disgraceful situation where 14 people are on trolleys in Mayo General Hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit while the Government has not yet released the &euro;400,000 necessary to advance the care of the elderly facility in Ballinrobe, County Mayo to the design and planning stage, which would help relieve congestion in Mayo General Hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department by freeing up beds.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="778"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Government to cap the price of building land first recommended in the Kenny report approximately 30 years ago in light of the continued escalation of house prices, a current increase of 7.2%, and the 50,000 families languishing on local authority house waiting lists and to give the Government an opportunity to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: to formulate a strategy along the lines outlined by Deputy Healy today to reverse the painful and dangerous trend in personal indebtedness in Ireland, which will be compounded further by the expected 10.8% rise &mdash; more than &euro;26,000 &mdash; in first-time buyer new house prices, to have the Government take its share of responsibility for this crisis and become active in resolving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 29, Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to adjourn at 1 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 30, statements on the World Trade Organisation trade negotiations. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 30 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael party, Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member, who shall be called upon in the following sequence, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case &mdash; Government, Fine Gael, Government, Labour, Government, Technical Group, sequence to recommence; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply, which shall not exceed five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 30, statements on the World Trade Organisation trade negotiations, agreed to? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chief Whip for removing the guillotine on No. 29. Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to persist with the Bill given that the Minister himself has no confidence in it and that Government backbenchers have all spoken against it? I do not know whether Deputy <Col N="779"/>O&rsquo;Connor spoke against it. Perhaps he could not mention Tallaght in a maritime Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no proposal before the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are never proposals before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>What if I have a back-up issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to speak on the matter during this morning&rsquo;s debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Time in the House is precious. If we are not competing, we should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important issue, namely, the procedures we follow in respect of this Bill. The question was asked on Committee Stage whether the Government intends, as it has declared, to pass this Bill by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not. I have called Deputy Kenny. If Deputy Eamon Ryan has a question on the Order of Business, his turn will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a number of matters with the T&aacute;naiste. According to section A of the pink list of Bills expected to be published, 11 have not been published to date. We are now in the last few weeks of this session. How many of the remaining 11 Bills will be published by the end of the session or before the start of the next session?</P>
      <P>Last month the Government announced a review of major projects, in particular those involving the health sector and including PPARS and FISP. Has the Government plans to bring forward primary or secondary legislation to deal with the consequences of that review?</P>
      <P>I received two letters today, one from the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and one about the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, which is unsigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this arising out of the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="780"/>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is arising out of the Order of Business because the Minister of State wrote in his letter, &ldquo;My Department is making real progress&rdquo;, and the other letter deals with another resignation. What is going on over there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question to the appropriate line Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the information given to the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, Deputy Bruton, that only one in nine civil servants plan to move, is there to be another announcement on budget day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;about this matter which was announced two years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first two questions are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very serious matter for those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that and therefore this matter should be raised by the Deputy in a very serious way by means of a question addressed directly to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make this point if I may and I will sit down then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation committee dealing with decentralisation is not answerable to the D&aacute;il and no Deputy &mdash; neither Independents nor party Members &mdash; can ask questions about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not arise on the Order of Business. I suggest the Deputy raise it in an appropriate way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a list of numbers willing to travel with their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste on the first two issues. The Deputy is being disorderly. There are ways of raising it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify something that was raised on the Order of Business yesterday by Deputy Gormley when he inquired whether barrier-free tolling legislation would be introduced and the Taoiseach said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I wish to clarify that such a measure is being considered as part of the roads (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which will be published early next year.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="781"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a case of Ivor freelancing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Bills referred to by Deputy Kenny, the top of the pink list says they will be published either during this session or up to the beginning of next session. I am advised this will be the case and it certainly is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will all 11 outstanding Bills be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not preparing specific legislation regarding the issue in the Department of Health and Children which was raised by the Deputy. However, there will be a lot of legislation from that Department next year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to anticipate what may be in the budget speech next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Kenny is right and only one in nine civil servants are prepared to move, could Deputy Ivor Callely not be switched around to a few different Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>He would shift them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy Rabbitte without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives a whole new meaning to Operation Freeflow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>And it is all one way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Rabbitte to raise something appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask about the housing(miscellaneous provisions) Bill in the context of the visit to Leinster House yesterday by the homeless group? May I ask the T&aacute;naiste, without giving away any budget secrets like her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whether there will be anything in the budget to deal with the homeless grievance of the people who visited Leinster House yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be published next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s clarification of the promise of legislation made by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport. His senior Minister has also made a statement that he will introduce legislation by the end of the year to establish the road safety authority. Following the meeting with the Taoiseach and his Minister of State yesterday, will the provision be contained <Col N="782"/>within the roads (miscellaneous provisions) Bill? The road safety authority has been promised and the Minister has stated he will have the legislation by the end of the year. Can the House believe this statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The roads (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will deal with issues concerning the National Roads Authority. It is not my information that issues to do with road safety will be part of that Bill. I will have the matter clarified by the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister promised it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It may well be separate legislation. I am not familiar with how it will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all over the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance has commissioned a number of reports into the taxation system. We have been given to understand these reports will underpin decisions announced in the budget. These reports are independent assessments. Will they be made available to the Opposition parties, either in advance of the budget so that we can assess their content and judge whether sound decisions are being made on the basis of these reports or published on budget day so the Opposition can have an informed basis on which to consider the budget announcements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise the matter with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance has been asked this question on a number of occasions and he has stated it is a matter for Government. The T&aacute;naiste is closer to Government than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate. I suggest the Deputy submit a question to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be normal for reports of that kind to be published at some stage; the issue is when. I will raise the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will join me in congratulating the Garda for three major drugs hauls since last Monday with a value in excess of &euro;18 million. Is there any chance of getting the extra 2,000 garda&iacute;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only imagine what could be done if we had the full resources. It is not just murder and mayhem&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy submits a question to the appropriate Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions. Can the T&aacute;naiste inform the House when the Second Stage of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill will come before the House? Will the T&aacute;naiste lay before the House the detail of the terms of reference of the inquiry into the death of Pat Joe Walsh at Monaghan General Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking whether it will be laid before the House or if the T&aacute;naiste would even indicate at least if the terms of reference have yet been agreed.</P>
      <P>On another matter, the T&aacute;naiste has promised outside the House that legislation to allow certain categories of nurses to prescribe medicines would be taken before the end of this session. She was reported as saying the legislation would be enacted before the end of the year. When will this legislation be published? Have the heads of the Bill been agreed? When will Second Stage be taken?</P>
      <P>Last week the House received Ireland&rsquo;s second report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child which was compiled by the National Children&rsquo;s Office within the Department of Health and Children. I had a parliamentary question directed to the T&aacute;naiste which was specific to that report but the question has now been moved to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;yet it is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s opinion and her Department. Will the T&aacute;naiste not accept that the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot pursue that matter in this way on the Order of Business. The Deputy knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Can a question be moved by the Questions Office or at someone&rsquo;s behest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the rules of the House the same as everybody else.</P>
      <P>I call the T&aacute;naiste to reply to the questions that are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of certain categories of nurses being prohibited to prescribe, that legislation has been passed in the Seanad and Second Stage will be taken in the House next week. It will be part of the Irish Medicines Board legislation.</P>
      <P>The legislation relating to the tribunals of inquiry has been published. It is a matter for the Whips to decide when it can be moved in the House.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="784"/>

	<P>What about the Pat Joe Walsh case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference are a matter for the HSE but I will ensure they are made available to the Deputy and to other Deputies.</P>

	<P>Could I ask the question and you can rule it out of order if is out of order?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The Chair has no control over the answers given to questions in this House and the Deputy is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It takes eight weeks to get information from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform through a parliamentary question. On two questions I tabled this week, I was told the information was imprecise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be of interest to the House that 36,000 questions have already been answered in the current year.</P>

	<P>When the Minister of Transport, Deputy Cullen, was out yesterday throwing shapes at the semi-permanent traffic jam at the M50 toll bridge, he did not indicate &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste did not specify this morning &mdash; the precise timescale for the toll relief through the roads (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.

	<P>In view of the fact that 3,500 farmers and 1,500 workers are on the verge of losing their jobs in the sugar beet industry, can time be provided to discuss this important matter? This involves more than 5,000 people in total. Many years ago legislation was enacted to set up the sugar company. It brought great prosperity to many towns throughout the country. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is allowing the entire industry to be decimated. Can time be provided to discuss this important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has already communicated with the Deputy that the matter would be considered for the Adjournment but in <Col N="786"/>view of the fact that he has made his speech on it, it is not necessary to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>

	<P>Given that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is in the House, we can get a first hand reply in a matter of promised legislation.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There will obviously be a substantial social welfare package in the budget, as there has been for the past eight years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>There was not.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Given the widespread fraud within our sea fisheries, given the extension of that process in corrupting the political system and given our inability to prosecute the widespread fraud cases in the fisheries area now before the DPP and elsewhere, does the Government intend to keep to its commitment to get all Stages of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 through.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a Deputy who is trying to assist in putting this Bill through, and this was raised in our committee yesterday, I have to say that it appears the Government is utterly divided on it. It is impossible to know its position. One Minister seems to have a different view to another. One backbencher is fighting with the Minister.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle. I welcome the fact the Leader of the Opposition is so interested in my contribution that he is staying to listen. I appreciate that.</P>
      <P>Last week during this debate a number of colleagues talked about the tragedy of the <i>Pisces</i> and the effect this had on the community in Wexford. This week the wider community is deeply affected by the loss of the <i>Rising Sun</i>. We have all watched with horror that story unfolding during the week, and the loss of the fishermen, Mr. Pat Colfer and Mr. Jimmy Meyler. I wish their colleague, Mr. Ian Tierney, well in his recovery. Our hearts go out to all the families and the community in Kilmore Quay and the wider area of County Wexford. I offer my deepest sympathies as do my colleagues.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Those of us who have come through the bad weather in Dublin this morning can only imagine what it is like out on the seas. We have heard <Col N="794"/>many accounts this week of the bravery of the coast guard and naval services as well as the lifeboat in Kilmore Quay. As someone who represents a largely urban area, I still have a great feel for the sea. I have said on other occasions that my paternal grandfather died at sea. It is good that we should applaud the efforts being made and I hope the Minister of State will take note of that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I made a number of comments last week in terms of this legislation in my roles both as public representative and consumer. I think the Ceann Comhairle will agree as to the merits of eating fish. When I did the cardiac rehabilitation course at Tallaght hospital, the emphasis was very much on healthy eating. Fish was high on the agenda and I am always happy to stress its importance in our diet. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will understand my interest in that regard. The main purpose of the Bill is to revise and amend the existing body of legislation relating to marine matters, particularly sea fisheries. It would be reasonable, therefore, to assume the legislation to be revised has been given careful consideration, and I have put that on the record.</P>
      <P>One section of the Bill deals with the whole question of firearms and their use. I am glad that the use of firearms has been eliminated. The Naval Service has laid down strict standard operational procedures as to when a naval vessel may open fire on another boat. That is not what the section appeared to be saying and I am glad of the Minister of State&rsquo;s intervention in that regard. It is important to point out that only the Minister may give that particular directive. The subsection specifically mentions the power in the context of an order from a sea fisheries protection officer. We are rightly proud of the Defence Forces and we do not expect them or the Garda to be instructed to open fire on salmon poachers. The guns on our naval vessels must be seen as quite powerful. If they were fired at a fishing boat, they would have a devastating effect. I consider their use in circumstances where a fishing vessel may be illegally fishing to be an extreme provision.</P>
      <P>The subsection refers to the use of a gun to fire a signal, so I presume this means firing blank ammunition. I suggest that fire star shell flares could be fired. I do not suggest that the Naval Service would be happy to open fire. I have every confidence in its ability to judge the situation in which it finds itself and take the appropriate action. The legislation could be clearer in this respect so I applaud the Minister of State&rsquo;s efforts to this end.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the presence of my colleague, Deputy Walsh, the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, who shares an office block with me. I have never had the opportunity of publicly applauding the efforts he made over the years. Even though I represent a major urban area such as Tallaght, there is also a rural community in my constituency in Bohernabreena and Brittas. <Col N="795"/>Deputy Walsh did much for those areas and I am happy to acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>Section 25 deals with assaults on sea fishery officers and provides that the person who assaults the officer may be fined up to &euro;5,000 or serve a prison sentence of a maximum of five years. It rightly does not mention opening fire on the person with guns. Assaulting a sea fisheries protection officer is a much more serious offence than poaching. I hope no one asks me about my attitude to poaching as I believe it is quite law abiding. I am happy to support the Minister of State in his efforts to pass this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be fooled by the spring in the step of Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan or any other seaside Deputy just because the Bill will not be rushed through the Houses before Christmas. There is still no change and the Bill will still be passed. We would not be discussing the Bill if it were not to be enacted. As the Government has a majority, I presume it will go through.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the logic of the Government. The Bill is the opposite of what is needed and the Government does not seem to know what it is doing on fisheries policy. Rather than having a fresh partnership approach to the management of fish stocks around the coast, this Bill is simply a mixture of extreme and over the top measures which will serve no purpose other than to drive a deeper wedge between the fishing industry and the legislators who are supposed to be working for the good of everyone. The Bill is certainly not the answer and it is a wasted opportunity to improve the fishing industry. Movements within the industry have been crying out for change over the years. I cannot believe that there is a section in the Bill which provides for the use of firearms against fishing vessels. The Minister of State has agreed to withdraw that, but it is hard to imagine the Naval Service firing at or into a boat.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has often spoken out against the high levels of fines imposed on Irish fishermen in comparison with the EU average. I call on the Minister of State to decriminalise minor fishing offences. The Bill represents an ideal opportunity to introduce such a change. The following changes should be made in this Bill. It must provide for administrative and graded sanctions. It must also decriminalise fisheries offences. According to published EU data, 86% of all EU fisheries offences are now dealt with by way of administrative action. Why are we not acting in this way? I cannot understand that.</P>
      <P>The section relating to seafood manager should be deleted in its entirety. This move will not improve control and enforcement. As laid out in this Bill, the seafood manager lacks accountability and sidelines the role of the Minister. Instead, a fully independent office should be established.</P>
      <P>The automatic confiscation of catching gear must be changed to allow the issue to be decided <Col N="796"/>at the discretion of the courts. This provision only applies to Irish vessels and that is particularly appalling. The fines and penalties in the Bill lack proportionality and must be reduced and changed. We need to enforce the principle that serious fishing offences attract serious penalties, but we must not push for harsh penalties for minor offences. Such a position will not be of benefit to anybody involved in the industry.</P>
      <P>There is something very strange about this Bill. There seemed to be a great rush to get it through the Houses before Christmas, which has eased following talks with the Whips. I am always suspicious of legislation that is rushed. I was in this House when the famous rod licence Bill was rushed through Parliament. The Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the day spent two years trying to defend the rod licence Bill, but it eventually had to be scrapped as it divided communities and was a serious misjudgment of legislation. Another example of rushed legislation occurred last year when the T&aacute;naiste tried to push through the nursing home charges Bill before Christmas last year only to find out in January that it was unconstitutional. Rushed legislation is bad legislation.</P>
      <P>I have not seen such opposition to a Bill since the rod licence legislation. Even Government Members have expressed opposition to it. Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, expressed his opposition, as did Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan who is from a constituency with fishing interests. How will they vote on Second Stage? Rumours have been circulating that the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is against the Bill. How could a Minister of State come before the D&aacute;il to push a Bill through the House and pretend that he is against it? He should clarify his position. You cannot be in Opposition in Donegal and in Government in Dublin. It would be much better to be in Government in Donegal and to be in the Opposition in Dublin if you are serious about being against this Bill.</P>

	<P>Allow Deputy McCormack without interruption. Deputy McCormack should address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>If everyone is against this Bill, why is it going through the Houses? Is it not significant that only one of our MEPs supports <Col N="797"/>this Bill? Why does the Minister of State want the Bill to go through at this time? Does he know something we do not? If he does, he should share it with us so that we may see the light in what he is trying to do. I can see no logic in it. If he has acquired some secret knowledge from the EU or from his officials, he should let us know. This House is the place where we can put things right in legislation.</P>
      <P>We are being asked to debate and pass a law, the true meaning of which remains unknown. The Minister of State should not leave gaping holes to be later filled by regulation.</P>
      <P>That is a serious matter. Sidelining the Oireachtas and giving this Minister, or future Ministers, power by regulation is not the correct way to pass legislation. How can Members know what Minister will be responsible in the future? Perhaps the next Minister will not even represent a marine constituency. However, although we have such a Minister now, he does not appear to be heeding what fishermen want.</P>
      <P>As multinationals come and go, we should learn to support our home industries, which will always remain in Ireland. As an island nation, we need to protect our fishing industry. In this respect, we can learn from our EU neighbours. Across Europe, the majority of member states deal with fisheries offences by way of administrative penalties. For example, in Spain in 2001, only four out of 3,500 fisheries offences went to the courts. Under existing legislation, all fisheries offences in Ireland are tried through the criminal courts. The subsequent fines imposed are significantly higher than anywhere else in Europe. This has been acknowledged by a number of EU Commission reports. Moreover, a criminal conviction for any person can have serious repercussions. This should not be the case in this respect. For example, criminal convictions are likely to interfere with fishermen&rsquo;s civil liberties. Many fishing families have children in America and possession of a criminal record might debar such fishermen from being able to visit their relatives in the United States. That is a serious matter which does not apply to other EU countries.</P>
      <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has consistently failed to manage our sea fishing resources. It has allowed the pelagic fish fleet to increase over the last number of years. The effect of the arrival of larger ships has been to increase the capacity of the pelagic fishing fleet by approximately 20%, at a time when we already had over-capacity in respect of our own quotas. The new super-trawlers have the capacity to travel further distances and to land their catches abroad. For example, in 2004, 75% of the pelagic mackerel quota was landed abroad. Large fish processing factories in County Donegal, such as those operated by Eurofish, Polarfish, Donegal Co-operative and Burtonport Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-operative, have closed in the past 18 months, due to the Department&rsquo;s mismanagement. Many of the remaining <Col N="798"/>14 fish processing factories will close due to lack of supplies if the current trend of mismanagement, control and enforcement is allowed to continue. We will become an island which has the richest fishing grounds in Europe but which has no fishing industry.</P>
      <P>If the Department and the Minister put half the energy and resources into the fishing negotiations in Brussels as they have put into pushing through this legislation, it would be much more beneficial to the coastal communities and to the fishing industry. It is accepted, even by members of the Government, that our fishing industry was sacrificed during the EU entry negotiations in 1973. The catch by other countries from our waters is conservatively estimated at more than &euro;2 billion per annum. At the Common Fisheries Policy review in 2002, we had an opportunity to renegotiate our position. A half-hearted delegation was led by the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who had only recently assumed responsibility for this portfolio. The result was that nothing was gained for the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The same Department now wishes to introduce this draconian legislation to close what is left of our fishing industry and to leave our quotas to be fished by factory ships and super-trawlers, with no benefit to Ireland. The House should be debating the squandering of the country&rsquo;s resources by successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, as well as by the Department. The last thing this industry needs is draconian and ill-conceived legislation designed only to cover up the mess created by the Department and the Minister, which is out of line with the norm in other European countries.</P>
      <P>For example, ten years ago, more than 40 trawlers were based in Rossaveal Harbour in my constituency. This number has now been reduced to 15. The main fish processing factory there, Iasc Mara Teoranta, employed 400 people at its peak. A total of 30 people are employed there now. That is a scandalous running down of this industry in Ireland. The feeling in Rossaveal is that this will get worse and that the industry is irrelevant to the Government. In the last Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government, Galway West was represented by the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, who promised &euro;29 million and a deepwater pier for Rossaveal. While I acknowledge that some work was done on the pier, that promise, like many others made by that Minister, was never fulfilled. Rossaveal still awaits its urgently required deepwater pier which will not now be delivered.</P>
      <P>Our fishing industry is in an extremely serious downward spiral. It is important in my constituency of Galway West as well as to all communities on the western seaboard. If fishermen continue to be treated in this fashion, they will leave the industry, in a manner similar to what is taking place in the farming sector. Ireland has richer fishing waters than any other EU state. It would <Col N="799"/>be a crime if the Minister&rsquo;s legislation was the last nail in the fishing industry&rsquo;s coffin.</P>
      <P>The ever-increasing fishing legislation and complicated regulatory framework has led us to a point whereby fishermen find it difficult to keep up to date with Irish and EU legislation. Regulations dealing with the management of fisheries have become extremely complicated. This Bill will only add to the mountain of legislation. Imagine a 76 page Bill containing more than 70 complicated sections or paragraphs. In effect, Members are being asked to debate and pass legislation, whose true meaning and extent remains unknown to them. The Minister should not leave gaping holes in the Bill to be filled later by regulation.</P>
      <P>The sidelining of the Oireachtas is wrong. Placing regulatory power in the hands of this or any other Minister is a dangerous weapon. While this Bill should support the fishing industry, instead it will provide further hardship for the men and women who form the backbone of one of our most important indigenous industries.</P>
      <P>As multinationals come and go, we must learn to support those industries which will always stay in Ireland. Across Europe, the majority of member states deal with fisheries offences by way of administrative penalties. Those found guilty of contravening quota notices will face fines nearly &euro;10,000 higher than existing legislation allows. One of the most dramatic increases is for those found in contravention of a licence. Those found guilty of that offence will face fines nearly ten times higher than those in existing legislation. This Bill will raise the fine from &euro;12,697 to &euro;100,000. This Bill will only add to mountains of regulations.</P>
      <P>In addition to these fines, there is also the issue of confiscation of catch and gear. Currently, there is automatic confiscation of gear and catch at Circuit Court level. However, this confiscation provision is only automatically applied to Irish vessels coming before the court. Why does the court have discretion on whether to confiscate catch and gear in the case of foreign vessels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Why do foreign fishermen operating in the same areas as Irish fishermen get preferential treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should read the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU report on behaviours which seriously infringed the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy highlighted the following fines. For fishing without a licence, on average one faces fines of &euro;1,463 in Spain. In Ireland the equivalent amount is &euro;21,400. Some fines proposed in this Bill are ten times higher than the current fines. For a logbook offence in Denmark, <Col N="800"/>one would probably face a fine of &euro;393. In Ireland, the same offence would cost &euro;8,455. In the United Kingdom, if one is found to be fishing for a species which is subject to prohibition, one faces a fine of &euro;2,328. In Ireland, the same offence would result in a fine of &euro;23,125</P>
      <P>How this can be considered an equal playing field is beyond me. This gives the impression that not only do we not support the Irish fishing fleet, but we try to stamp it out.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the Irish fishing industry have been campaigning for the implementation of a fairer and more appropriate system, with penalties which fit the offence. This campaign has attempted to change the existing legislation. However, the implementation of the Bill in its current form will have an even more detrimental impact on the Irish fishing industry than the existing legislation. These are genuine and serious concerns about some of the proposals in the Bill. I wish the Minister of State would come clean and inform the House on the real thinking behind them because nobody seems to understand them.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I hope it is not live ammunition that is being fired across the House. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. I welcome the debate and the fact that a contribution has been made by Deputies on all sides of the House and from all areas of the country, not just the coastal constituencies.</P>
      <P>The focus on fishing is long overdue and our native Governments have neglected the industry in a major way over the years. It is only in recent years that attention has been turned to developing the industry to realise its potential. Since my election in 1977, I have seen a major transition in the industry in Cork South-West, <Col N="806"/>particularly in the ports of Castletownbere, Union Hall, Skull, Kinsale and Baltimore. It is the major industry in the constituency and, along with tourism and farming, it makes up the mainstay of employment. I am thankful the fleet and harbours have been modernised over the period. An initiative was taken by Fianna F&aacute;il to modernise the fleet in 1997 and I thank Deputy Woods in this regard as he was Minister that year. It was a very futuristic and innovative development because, at the time, the average age of the Irish fleet was in excess of 30 years. It was the second oldest whitefish fleet in Europe. Fishing families can now be more content that the fishermen are at sea in much safer vessels than those of previous generations.</P>
      <P>When discussing legislation and regulations, it is easy to forget that there is a human side to the industry. Fishermen have to go out in appalling and dangerous weather conditions. I wish some of the people drafting the relevant regulations would take a trip to sea now and again to note the extent of the danger and difficulties fishermen must endure. People do not fully appreciate the isolated nature of our coastal communities. Fishing is central to the economic and social lives of many coastal regions. If these areas did not have fishing, there would be no other source of employment. It is a pity there is not better access to many of the coastal ports. Having said that, access is improving. Roadways are improving a little, but not quickly enough, and the same is the case for harbours and piers. Technology, especially telecommunications technology, is improving but it will be some time before ports such as Castletownbere have broadband technology such as exists in the major technology and business parks in other parts of the country. To say peripherality is being addressed is not quite true and we must pay more attention to coastal communities and towns.</P>
      <P>I know from my constituents that the fishing industry is going through a difficult time, particularly as a result of high fuel costs. Given the highly capitalised nature of the industry, increases in the cost of borrowing will have a major impact on the viability of the industry. I know fishermen who have to extend their credit periods, just as homeowners extend their mortgages. It is in this context and in light of the aforementioned social and economic issues that we need to discuss this legislation. In my three decades as a Member, I discovered that the vast majority of fishermen are sturdy and brave people. They have tremendous energy and capacity for hard work in dangerous and difficult conditions. Treating these people like criminals is not right in our modern democracy. A constituent called me recently to tell me that he had been fined &euro;700 for having two untagged salmon. He is trying to build a house, get married and settle down. To be fined &euro;700 for two untagged salmon was quite difficult.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="807"/>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He will be fined &euro;7,000 if this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Another constituent was tried in the Circuit Court because the value of his over-quota fish was &euro;1,200. His fine was &euro;5,000. His gear and catch were automatically confiscated, resulting in a total penalty of almost &euro;25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be &euro;100,000 under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know any other industry where this can happen. I had responsibility for agriculture for some time. Farmers would not have their milking parlours, fattening units or their wherewithal confiscated, nor would truck drivers have their means of livelihood confiscated. It just would not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy going to vote for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have serious doubts about the mentality and the hostility of the people who drafted this legislation. The hostility required to include some sections of this Bill is mind-boggling. I am quite concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy vote for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just asking if he is going to vote for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Had this vessel been foreign, the judge would have had discretion about the confiscation of gear and catch. I am aware there is a differentiation between people who are caught fishing illegally in foreign vessels and those who are just caught within the waters. Nonetheless, foreign vessels are treated differently from Irish vessels. It is difficult to comprehend how we can have that anomaly.</P>
      <P>In addition, people who are tried and convicted in the Circuit Court have a criminal record. That is serious baggage for any citizen to carry and it causes untold difficulties. It is extremely serious for a young person to have a conviction as a result of a fishery offence. It is a severe way to treat people in this industry. I, as a parent, and parents in general would be slow to encourage their offspring to go into this industry. Parents will encourage their children to seek their livelihood in some other part of the economy where there will be a better and warmer reception for them and a degree of encouragement rather than a system that imposes outrageous penalties for relatively minor offences.</P><Col N="808"/>
      <P>I am aware that we will be given the usual official line that there will be difficulties in Brussels if we do not enact this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always encouraged officials to find reasonable solutions in a reasonable atmosphere. Unfortunately, in this case we are being given all the reasons that we cannot do something as opposed to why we can. Finding obstacles rather than a resolution appears to be the attitude.</P>
      <P>We must also ask if it is an appropriate use of court time to clog up the courts with minor offences to do with log books and so forth. We should not use the courts. I agree with the views of other Members on all sides of the House who said we should treat many of these minor offences as administrative matters. It does not make sense to put fishermen with relatively minor log book offences, for example, side by side in court with drug dealers and other hardened criminals. If this is the way we treat hard working people in a difficult industry, I do not believe we have a vision for a modern fishery industry. We must ask ourselves if it is a priority to develop this natural resource industry. At the very minimum, there should be a differentiation between major and minor offences.</P>
      <P>I have severe difficulties with the detail of the Bill. In light of what I have said, it is essential that the Bill decriminalise the majority of fishery offences. Only serious fishery infringements should attract criminal proceedings. The Bill contains no provision for the decriminalisation of minor fishery offences and this runs contrary to the European system of dealing with such offences where 86% of them are dealt with administratively. We will get legal advice that we should not deal with them administratively and that the court system should deal with them. What other advice would one get from a legal person other than that things should be dealt with in the legal system? It is part of the old boys&rsquo; club.</P>
      <P>The European Commission representative at the recent JIC hearing stated that the Commission favours administrative sanctions over criminal proceedings. Why are they not included in the proposed legislation? There is no European impediment and surely we are capable of overcoming any domestic impediments. If a system is good enough for almost 90% of Europe, it can be applied in Ireland. One example I have been made aware of is that of Denmark where, if a vessel commits an offence at sea, it is handed a ticket by the navy and must return to port. The navy can continue to patrol the seas rather than escorting the vessel to port, as happens in Ireland. When the offending vessel arrives in port it must tie up for a period. This appears to be a sensible approach. It is dissuasive for the vessel, preserves the quota and does not use valuable naval and court resources. I am sure that if we examine the <Col N="809"/>methods of control being practised by our EU neighbours, we will find a reasonable alternative. What we are seeking here is fairness and reasonableness and less of the jackboot attitude.</P>
      <P>The second major issue I have with this Bill is the automatic confiscation of gear and catch for Irish vessels. If in other professions the means of livelihood were confiscated, the economy would not work. In a democracy it is an outrage. I cannot fathom it. As legislators, we cannot preside over this two tier approach any longer. It is time to address it and this Bill provides us with the opportunity to do so. I am glad the guillotine has been removed from debate on this legislation and that an opportunity will be provided for debate on Committee Stage. Even if one is not a member of an Oireachtas committee, one can attend and contribute to the meeting. There is also a public gallery in the committee rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be dealt with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will welcome Members making telling contributions in the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting the EU report on behaviour which seriously infringes the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland. Ireland did not supply any figures for the 2003 report and having looked at the 2002 report, I can see why. The previous speaker referred to the average fines in Ireland and the average fines in Europe. The fact that the fines in Ireland are a multiple of those in Europe speaks volumes for our attitude to this industry. Nonetheless, despite the fact that our fines are so much higher than those imposed in Europe, this Bill proposes to increase them even further. The fine for the use of illegal nets, for example, is being increased from &euro;63,000 to &euro;100,000, the fine for contravention of quota notices is being increased from &euro;25,000 to &euro;35,000, and the fine for fishing in contravention of licences is being increased from &euro;12,000 to up to &euro;100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy vote for all that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also provision in the Bill for the creation of the post of seafood control manager within the Department. This is a real beauty. The holder of this position will be answerable only to the Secretary General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>To himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would be neutered and sidelined. If we table a parliamentary question we will be told the Minister has no official responsibility for the matter and can wash his or her hands of it. This is not the way modern democracy should work. We have been elected, and fishermen make up part of the electorate of those of us elected in coastal regions, to speak for the people in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Now we are pro<Col N="810"/>posing to set up a seafood control manager who would be outside the reach of the publicly elected people in a democracy. This goes too far, and there should be accountability to this House and transparency.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher understands the industry and has a feel for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Ask him to withdraw the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>He wishes to develop the industry during his watch, and we want to help him. It would be an understatement to say that I would be disappointed if we do not emerge with a vastly improved Bill. The input of Members is what democracy is about. I still worry about the original drafters of this Bill, and the hostility towards the industry in the drafting of some of the sections is mind-boggling. I am a firm believer that the Minister of the day should have ultimate responsibility for the staff in his or her Department. The Minister should be available to Oireachtas committees, the Committee of Public Accounts and various statutory controls over high officials. This seafood control manager should be no different.</P>
      <P>On the first reading of the proposed Bill, I was astonished to see the provision for the use of firearms. It may be the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar and the death of Horatio Nelson, but I am not sure about the use of guns in the fishing context. I am glad the Minister of State brought his personal intervention to bear on the matter. The inflammatory section will be well and truly deleted. Thankfully, the Minister of State&rsquo;s commonsense and knowledge of the industry has been brought to bear on the issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It lacks credibility to simply suggest that Brussels is forcing our hand on the matters. We need a national strategy for this tremendous natural resource industry which has been neglected for so long. In the late 1990s I established a high level group to develop a strategy for the agriculture industry, entitled the 2010 study. This allowed examination of what the first decade of the new millennium would have to offer the industry. Before I left the post of Minister last year a mid-term refreshment of the national strategy was carried out. Is there such a strategy for our seafood industry? I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a similar strategy is developed quickly.</P>
      <P>Seafood should be a part of the overall food industry. However, the Estimate for Bord Iascaigh Mhara is minuscule. BIM must develop the fleet and the seafood industry, and we are often told that seafood is so healthy and we must have quality and a modern industry. We are selling the industry short with the pittance that BIM has to develop the industry and promote the seafood element. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure there is a worthwhile and substantial budget for our native and natural seafood industry.</P><Col N="811"/>
      <P>Having spoken to fishermen, I know they are despondent and morale is extremely low in the industry. They may be wondering if this Bill is the final nail in the coffin of the industry. They want encouragement, and we are depending on the Minister of State to safeguard the industry, restore morale and give people in the industry a future, both for themselves and their families. I would like to think that fishermen could say to their families that there is future in the industry, that a decent living can be made and that the workers will be valued members of the Irish democracy. I would also like to believe they could see themselves as a significant and influential part of our economy.</P>
      <P>I wish to know in the grand scheme of things where our fishing and seafood industry comes with regard to the Celtic tiger. I do not see it mentioned or hear of it making an impact in many of the economic reports, and I would like to see this remedied. One fisherman said last week &ldquo;if there is meant to be so much money in fishing, why are people looking to decommission vessels?&rdquo; In my own constituency, nine vessels, all over 18m in length, have been accepted for decommissioning in the first tranche announced last week.</P>
      <P>We clearly need regulations for the industry, and as legislators we must be wise to the type of legislation that will take us into the next decade and beyond. We must be fair and balanced with the legislation. We should encourage people into the industry and help them rather than drive them out of business by introducing penalties that far exceed measures taken in the rest of Europe at this time. I am confident the suggested amendments I outlined earlier will be taken on board by the Minister of State. He has a tremendous understanding of the industry, probably a better understanding than any other person in the House. These proposed improvements would also gather cross-party support and I know they have the backing of the entire fishing industry.</P>

      <P>The Waterford constituency has a very long tradition in fishing. In the 1700s there was a significant connection between Waterford and Newfoundland, which was discovered in 1497 by John Cabot. It has been said that if one put down a bucket tied to a rope into the sea at the time, it would catch cod because that fish was so plentiful at that stage. It is also said that at one stage, 25% of the European population was fed on cod from that general area.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>There has been scientific indication that the stocks were in trouble some years ago and in 1992 the cod fishery was closed. The result was that 40,000 jobs were lost in an economy where alternative employment is difficult to provide. My information is that there has been no recovery in the stocks which are holding their own but no more than that. An interesting point in this regard is that the female cod traditionally tended to breed in year seven. Nature has its own way of dealing with problems and owing to the current pressure on stocks, the female cod is breeding from year four on. However, there has been no recovery in the stocks.</P>
      <P>I wish to relate this issue to the situation pertaining to Irish stocks of Atlantic salmon. A story from the 19th century tells that apprentices in Limerick won a concession from their masters to the effect that they could not be fed salmon on more than three days a week. The obvious indication is that the stocks were strong at that time. However, stocks in Ireland are now in serious decline. Since 2002 the sector has failed to reach its own quota. In 2002 the quota was 219,649 tags but only 208,982 were used. In 2003 the quota was reduced to 182,000 but the catch was just 168,819. The scientific advisory group recommended 124,500 tags for the 2005 quota, although the National Salmon Commission later increased this to 139,900 tags. However, what concerns me is that just over 70,000 fish were caught, based on the number of tags used. This is less than 50% of the catch in 2004 when 145,453 salmon were caught from a quota of 161,965. The sector is failing to reach its quota.</P>
      <P>The time is more than ripe for the introduction of a buyout system for drift net, draft net and snap net commercial salmon fishermen. In his most recent reply to me, the Minister of State indicated that he is considering a proposal that was put to him. However, to date he has not shown any great enthusiasm for a buyout.</P>
      <P>Salmon licences are important in my constituency. While the fishermen who hold those <Col N="813"/>licences do not earn their whole income from salmon, their salmon income is in decline and many would voluntarily opt for a buyout system provided it is fair. I emphasise that it must be fair. A buyout would be an important way of ensuring the maintenance of salmon stocks which are a major part of our history, heritage and tradition through the years, particularly an brad&aacute;n feasa &mdash; the salmon of knowledge.</P>
      <P>The Stop Drift Net Fishing Now campaign has proposed the methodology for a plan that would cost &euro;25 million over a five-year period and which would be partially funded by the recreational salmon fishing licence holders paying an extra &euro;50 for their annual licences. The anglers lobby has a legitimate place in this debate. Indeed, the tourism industry is very much to the fore in promoting salmon fishing.</P>
      <P>The tagging system must be carefully considered in all its aspects. Older fishermen often continue fishing because it helps to finance the third level studies of their grandchildren. Particular individuals and families feel a great sense of history and heritage in their involvement over many years in salmon fishing and they would be reluctant to withdraw. For any buyout system to be successful, it must be voluntary. If some fishermen do not want to avail of the buyout, they should be restricted to the sort of quota of tags they would have had if no buyout had been introduced. The bottom line is to stabilise and conserve the stocks and give them the opportunity to recover to a level where sustainability is possible in the context of some level of salmon being caught each year.</P>
      <P>Another important issue arises in this regard. As the Minister knows, the feeding grounds for Atlantic salmon are off Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Northern fishermen have gone down the road of not fishing in those grounds to protect the stocks. I understand there is impatience among these fishermen and that this restraint may not continue. If the northern fishermen decide to fish for salmon in the feeding grounds, a catastrophe would face us all. While I am not suggesting this will happen, it is a strong possibility that has been indicated to me by one person who should know.</P>
      <P>As good Europeans, we should accept that the Irish catch is having an adverse affect not alone on Irish salmon stocks but also on the stocks of England, Wales, Spain, France, Switzerland and Germany. While this is not my major consideration in this debate, it is an important consideration nonetheless.</P>
      <P>Fishermen who make a poor income from salmon fishing and who would be happy to leave the industry should be given an opportunity to do so by way of a buyout system. I see nothing wrong with the State putting resources into such a system. While I do not have exact figures, the Stop Drift Net Fishing Now campaign suggests a figure of &euro;25 million and the Minister of State suggests a figure of the order of &euro;70 million or <Col N="814"/>&euro;80 million. Whatever the cost, this is a very important resource and one we must protect soon. I understand that successful compensation programmes to end the commercial exploitation of salmon have been introduced in Canada, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Wales, and work in progress in Northern Ireland and England is moving ahead effectively. The North Atlantic Salmon Fund told me it spoke to some Irish commercial fishermen, 70% to 80% of whom were ready to surrender their licences permanently. The remaining 20% to 30% would agree to stop fishing but were reluctant to accept a permanent buy-out. Of them 5% to 10% opposed the buy-out and remained to be convinced of its merit.</P>
      <P>All fishing enterprises involve sustainability and profitability. Our stocks are depleted to a critical point. There is the horrible prospect that what happened to the Newfoundland cod stocks will happen here. We do no service to commercial salmon fishers by not buying them out to protect stocks. If the stocks fall below a certain point they will not recover. That is what happened to the cod stocks off Newfoundland, although the fishery there is closed. No one would have believed such a large fishery could be fished out but that happened.</P>
      <P>We need to protect the stocks of North Atlantic salmon as much in the interests of the fishermen, as of anybody else. The fishermen should be allowed to exit the industry in a dignified and fair way to protect this part of our resources.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is concerned about various aspects of this legislation. We were concerned when the Government came into power that it dropped the word &ldquo;marine&rdquo; from the title of the Department. This indicated an unwelcome attitude. That omission was rectified and I do not in any way question the personal commitment to, or knowledge of, the industry of the Minister of State with responsibility for the marine. Prior to the last general election a commitment was made to appoint a Minister with responsibility for marine affairs to sit at the Cabinet table. This was to have been a senior Minister of State but the proposal never bore fruit.</P>
      <P>A significant part of marine responsibility is to be transferred to the Department of Transport. While I do not oppose change I remain to be convinced that responsibility for marine affairs is divisible because there are many interdependent areas in that brief. For example, there is an obvious need to ensure ships do not dump in fishing grounds and that activities surrounding ports or marine development are carried out in a way conducive to protecting fish stocks, particularly when fish are breeding.</P>
      <P>Another minor but important point concerns section 17(3) covering the powers of sea fishery protection officers and the inspection and detention of sea fish. The section states:</P><Col N="815"/>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">Where a sea-fisheries protection officer detains in his or her custody under this section any sea-fish and the sea-fish is likely to become unfit for human food before the matter can conveniently be dealt with by any court, he or she may produce the sea-fish to a designated officer (where he or she is not a designated officer), and, if authorised so to do by the designated officer, shall destroy, sell or otherwise dispose properly of the sea-fish.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The idea of fish being destroyed is repugnant. It is wrong to destroy food in a world where there is hunger and famine. The civilised approach would be for the Minister of State to reconsider that section and eliminate the word &ldquo;destroy&rdquo;. If fish is unfit for human consumption it should be destroyed but there should be procedures whereby fish fit for human consumption taken into custody is not allowed in any circumstances to become unfit for human consumption. We should preserve all aspects of this scarce resource wherever possible. I urge the Minister of State to deal sympathetically with that point on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party also believes there should have been more consultation with the stakeholders and their political representatives in regard to the Bill. It is not too late for that process although there are differing views on how Committee Stage will proceed. However, within the short interval between this Stage and the next the Minister of State should consult with stakeholders to hear their views and so improve the legislation.</P>
      <P>I was about to move onto the business of harsh fines which other Deputies have raised but will conclude on this point. As a democrat and a Member of this House I wish to see this Bill made as effective as possible, for both a vibrant fishing industry, and for enforcement. That is important but it must be a profitable and sustainable industry.</P>

      <?oasys _ah?>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill which is important to the livelihoods of many of my constituents. I express my sympathy to the Meyler and Colfer families on the awful tragedy that occurred in recent days off the Great Saltee Island. That tragedy typifies fishing activity for many people.</P>
      <P>I first became acquainted with the fishing industry when I went to work in Bridgetown vocational college, approximately four miles from Kilmore Quay. Many of the students attending the college were children of fishermen. Many too were good hurlers and footballers. My later <Col N="816"/>involvement with Wexford hurling and football teams brought home to me the awful social conditions under which people participate in fishing. None of the good hurlers and footballers went on to play at senior level for Wexford.</P>
      <P>The sea shanties that we talk about and the beautiful way of life for fishermen is very different from what I discovered when I went to work in a fishing area. From Bridgetown I went to Ramsgrange where I taught Pat Colfer and Jim Myler who went to secondary school there. Fishing is important to County Wexford but its fishermen are experiencing difficult times. The fishing industry was not as important as other industries in the negotiations for Ireland&rsquo;s entry to the EEC. Neither did the 1983 Common Fisheries Policy reflect the hardships of the fishing industry. The Opposition parties were in power then when the policy was introduced. I do not want to be party political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Green Party was not part of that. Sometimes the hand-wringing engaged in when in Opposition does not reflect the reality of the political scenario.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We are lucky to have Deputy Gallagher as Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with special responsibility for the marine. Unlike me, bh&iacute; seisean p&aacute;irteach i saol na n-iascair&iacute; agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina iascaire &eacute; f&eacute;in le fada an l&aacute;. The Minister was part of the fishing industry and grew up in it. There is no man better qualified to introduce this Bill with the sensitivity it demands. I thank him for coming to County Wexford on many occasions to talk to the scallop fishermen.</P>
      <P>I empathise with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea on the salmon industry. The scallop industry was similarly affected. The scallop stocks could not be sustained as there were twice as many people fishing them as there should have been. Thanks to the Minister of State, he negotiated a decommissioning package for the scallop fishermen. While I am not long in politics, I do not believe decommissioning was available for fishermen before this. This is a scheme that many of my constituents are happy with and I look forward to the payments being made after 9 December.</P>
      <P>This Bill is needed because of the Kennedy and Browne cases which underlined the basis for the legal implementation of fishing law. If these cases had never arisen, the Bill would still be necessary to stop foreign vessels taking a &euro;1 million catch at a time. Overfishing must be combated. However, a distinction must be made between minor offences and those that threaten the very survival of the industry. From talking to many fishermen, many of whom are past pupils of mine, I note their serious and legitimate concerns about the Bill.</P><Col N="817"/>
      <P>One concern relates to the need for balance. Fishermen do not want to be seen as common criminals. As for administrative sanctions such as on-the-spot fines for speeding on the roads, the Attorney General claims these cannot happen without further negotiation with the EU. Obviously, I want them to happen. There needs to be a distinction between summary minor offences and people who threaten the very survival of the industry. The depletion of fishing stocks and the clarification of fishing law will be dealt with by the Bill, thereby ensuring the preservation of the industry.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to discover the provision allowing the Naval Service to fire on fishing vessels has been part of Irish law since 1959. Listening to Members, who have been in politics for a long time, decrying this, I was amazed some did not notice it before. The provision has been in place since 1959 and sincerity demands that Members are honest when dealing with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. Thanks to the sensitivity of both the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, this will be removed from the Bill, meaning the Naval Service will not fire on Irish fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The confiscation of fishing gear causes some problems of morality for me. I am reminded of the archbishop who said: &ldquo;Give me a fish and you feed me today; teach me to fish and you feed me for life.&rdquo; If fishing gear is taken away from a fisherman, the victim becomes a burden on the State rather than a hard-working individual plying his trade. I have concerns about this but I know the Minister of State will examine the case with sensitivity. T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go dtabharfadh m&eacute; faoi deara na s&oacute;irt coireanna at&aacute; i gceist. It is essential that we examine the nature of the crimes and that the Bill addresses minor offences.</P>
      <P>The physical hardships experienced by fishermen are reflected in the stories of Tom&aacute;s &Oacute;<?oasys _jy?>Criomhthain, Peig Sayers or <i>Fiche Blian ag F&aacute;s</i>. It is an industry that was ignored when we joined the EEC and ignored further in 1983 with negotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy. I recall teaching economic geography to leaving certificate students whose future was in the fishing industry. While many, owing to economic necessity, did not go on to take the leaving certificate, those who did would always take issue with the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The Bill offers an opportunity to restore morale to fishermen and their families. It will allow the implementation of laws where the punishment fits the crime and protects the non-offenders against the small number of offenders. Balance is what it is about. T&aacute;im cinnte go dtuigeann an t-Aire St&aacute;it go maith na deacrachta&iacute; a bhaineann le saol an iascaire agus go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; a dh&iacute;cheall chun iad a thabairt faoi deara sa Bhille.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on his commitment to the fishing industry, not just during his term in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but also in Brussels and Strasbourg where he represented the people of Connacht-Ulster with such distinction.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is to modernise the legislative framework for sea fisheries. The principal Act in place was adopted in the mid-20th century and was subject to several amendments. It was designed for a sea fishing industry which primarily involved short trips by small boats. However, the sea fishing industry has changed beyond recognition since then in terms of the size of the fleet. It now includes many multi-million euro businesses with large Irish boats operating in far away regions and large non-Irish boats fishing in Irish waters. These boats often land their catches in Ireland. Many Members are familiar with the number of French vessels which land at Killybegs and Castletownbere.</P>
      <P>The industry is now substantially regulated at EU level through the Common Fisheries Policy. In addition, the Bill is designed to fill a major gap in the Fisheries Acts regarding the implementation of the EU Common Fisheries Policy following litigation which resulted in the impugning by the Supreme Court of certain secondary legislation for lack of cover in the current Acts. It is necessary to amend the legal framework to have regard to these realities and to modernise our systems and structures so that best practice in fisheries management and control is implemented.</P>
      <P>While the Bill represents a sound basis for progress, it needs further work. I am confident that the Minister of State will take these views on board before enactment. The regulation of the fishing industry in Ireland must accommodate the small vessel as well as the large fish processing boats that fish in European waters. In this regard, I suggest several changes to the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill must provide for administrative and graded sanctions and decriminalise fisheries offences. According to EU data, 86% of all EU fisheries offences are now dealt with by way of administrative sanctions. The section relating to the seafood manager should be deleted in its entirety as it is only a mechanism for resolving an internal Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources management issue. It will add little or nothing to providing improved control and enforcement, lacks accountability and undermines and sidelines the role of the Minister. Should such a position be necessary, a fully independent office of seafood control regulator should be established with appropriate appeals mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The automatic confiscation of catch and gear which only applies to Irish vessels must be changed to allow the issue to be decided at the discretion of the courts. The fines and penalties detailed in the Bill lack proportionality and must <Col N="819"/>be reduced and changed. The underlining principle must be that only major fisheries should attract serious penalties. There is no reason a small fisherman should be put out of business because of a once-off indiscretion. Proportionality must be borne in mind when the issue of fines and penalties is discussed.</P>
      <P>The provision on the use of firearms against fishing vessels must be deleted. Emotions can run high on the seas and tense situations might only be inflamed by the use of firearms. In society as a whole we condemn the use and prevalence of firearms. Surely, therefore, we should try to curtail the prevalence of firearms rather than legislating for their use on fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate one cannot but draw the obvious parallels between the fishing and agriculture industries, both of which are an integral part of the food production system in Ireland and the European Union as a whole. The changes which have taken place in both sectors since we joined the European Economic Community in the early 1970s have been seismic and phenomenal. One of the primary reasons for the establishment of the Common Agricultural Policy was security of food supply.</P>
      <P>Time and tide wait for no man but I am certain the Bill endeavours to reflect one consideration, namely, that if over-fishing continues across European Union waters, the ultimate outcome will be the demise of the fishing industry. It is vital that we retain this integral part of our food supply chain and if intensive protection measures are required over a specific period, so be it. It is essential that those who have invested in the industry overcome the current temporary difficulty and have a viable industry in the long term, not only to ensure the supply of food for the Irish and European markets but also to support and sustain those who work in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Crowe and Sargent.</P>
      <P>I have major reservations about the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 in its current form. Why is the Government seeking to introduce this flawed legislation? I am not alone in having these reservations, as many Members, including those on the Government benches, have similar reservations. Why is the Government so keen to press ahead with the Bill? When a division is called will the Government backbench Deputies stand by their principles and vote against the Bill? I am afraid they will not do so and the Minister of State will lead them like a flock of sheep into the lobbies to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is returning to the fold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State certain of that? If the Government claims its purpose is to bring Ireland into line with European Union <Col N="820"/>legislation, the Bill will not achieve its objective. The measures are excessive and unfair to Irish fishermen and the proposed fines and punishments for infringements are disproportionate in comparison with those in place in other EU countries. For example, the penalty for fishing without a licence in Spain is a fine of &euro;1,463, whereas the equivalent fine here will be &euro;21,000. The Bill contains several other examples of such discrepancies which would impose a disproportionate punishment on the hard-pressed Irish fishing industry in comparison with its EU counterparts.</P>
      <P>While I do not condone in any way the violation of fishing rules and regulations, it is unjust to impose on Irish fishermen penalties which are more severe than those imposed on fishermen from other countries. Fishermen here have long been penalised excessively. The Bill, as framed, is unacceptable to them and should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned by the proposal to allow the Naval Service to shoot at trawlers which fail to stop when requested to do so. Were such incidents to occur, they could easily result in serious injury or loss of life. This provision is unacceptable in any democracy and the Government will have to find an alternative approach to address the matter. Even Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputies have called on the Minister of State to remove the provision allowing the use of force.</P>
      <P>The Government is putting a political spin on the introduction of the legislation by implying it has arisen as a result of the wishes of the European Union. Such an implication is not only untrue according to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn, but it also threatens to criminalise Irish fishermen. Why then is the Government pressing ahead with the legislation? Is it another example of its perceived policy of ignoring and downgrading all types of rural life and concentrating on corporate Ireland on the east coast, particularly the Dublin area? It is disgraceful that it will not invest time and resources in providing proper facilities for the fishing community. For example, proper piers and landing facilities are required in Quilty and Doonbeg and proper safety measures are needed in Doolin, all of which are in my constituency. The Government prefers to criminalise fishermen and seeks to justify firing shots into boats. I call on it to withdraw this crazy Bill and work towards improving the lives of fishermen and their families rather than wrecking them.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to the sinking of a fishing boat in the teeth of a storm in Quilty 12 months ago. What was the Government&rsquo;s response? It offered no assistance, despite the fact that fishermen&rsquo;s livelihoods were wrecked. We want proper landing facilities in Doonbeg, Doolin and Quilty. When will the Minister of State provide funding to protect those in County Clare who earn a livelihood from fishing. He has talked a great deal but I have yet to <Col N="821"/>see him take action on the ground to help fishermen in my county. Did he do anything to help them when the boat I referred to sank? No, he said the storm which sank it was an act of God.</P>

	<P>One of the most interesting aspects of the debate on the Bill so far concerns the differences it has highlighted within Fianna F&aacute;il, and the opposition of some Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies to the thrust of the legislation as it affects penalties on fishermen. In this regard, it is interesting that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are attempting to have motions placed for debate in the European Parliament which, if accepted, would go completely against the intent of this Bill. The main thrust of the motions are that penalties should be proportionate and should not discriminate between national fleets and those from other EU member states and, above all, that the means employed to enforce legislation should not have the effect of criminalising fishermen.</P>
      <P>Many people, including those in my own party, agree with the sentiments expressed, but surely the place to address them is here. The logic therefore of the opposition from within the industry and across the political parties represented here is that this legislation should be withdrawn. The whole system of regulations and penalties employed in the sector should be subject to a total review and reform. That will also require that this State demands that the entire basis on which Irish fisheries are governed through the Common Fisheries Policy should be re-negotiated and that the CFP be subject to a similar process <Col N="822"/>to that undergone by the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>As regards those directly involved in the fishing industry and the risks attached, I want to raise an issue of serious concern that has been brought to my attention today. I want to raise this matter now because there will be no other opportunity to do so and it is an issue of the utmost urgency. The Navy believes it has found the wreckage of the fishing vessel the <i>Rising Sun</i>, which sank off the Wexford coast on Tuesday. The Navy has put in place a one-mile exclusion zone around the area of the wreckage and has indicated to the family that it may be a crime scene.</P>
      <P>The Navy is causing great hurt to the family of the missing skipper Mr. Pat Colfer by telling them that divers are not to go down and search the sunken vessel for his remains. The Navy has indicated that it may be Sunday before divers are sent down. It has also indicated that there will be a criminal prosecution following any intervention by the family concerning the wreckage.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have also been informed that the Navy has telephoned local divers instructing them not to go near the wreckage. The senior naval person on the scene showed great discourtesy and lack of sympathy towards Mr. Colfer&rsquo;s brother when he attempted to discuss the situation with him.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence must intervene and ensure that the Navy does not hinder attempts to commence the search of the sunken vessel for the remains of the lost fisherman. This is a humanitarian request from a family which has been devastated by this tragedy. I appeal to the Minister of State, if he can, to intervene in this process.</P>
      <P>The Minister must assure this House that every sympathy and understanding will be shown to the family by the naval authorities in any future dealings with them. I realise that this information is probably new to the Minister of State, but the family has contacted us about this serious situation so I would appreciate it if he could do something about it.</P>

	<P>Tagann s&eacute; aniar aduaidh orm an m&eacute;id eolais at&aacute; ag an Teachta Crowe mar gheall ar an trag&oacute;id is d&eacute;ana&iacute; i saol na hiascaireachta sa t&iacute;r seo. Ag an am c&eacute;anna, agus muid ag l&eacute;iri&uacute; comhbhr&oacute;in leo si&uacute;d a cailleadh le blianta beaga anuas de bharr na hiascaireachta, n&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an mBille Iascaigh Mhara agus Dl&iacute;nse Muir&iacute; 2005 chun ceisteanna a phl&eacute; at&aacute; n&iacute;os leithne n&aacute; sin ach f&oacute;s ceangailte leis.</P>
      <P>I offer my sympathy and that of the Green Party, an Comhaontas Glas, to those bereaved by the tragic sinking of the trawler <i>Rising Sun</i>&mdash; the family of Mr. Jimmy Meyler of Passage East, County Wexford, and the family of the boat&rsquo;s skipper Mr. Pat Colfer, who are still holding out some hope of finding him, although hope is fading. We thank God that Mr. Ian Tierney of Kilmore Quay is safe. At the same time, however, we must bear in mind that this is by no means an isolated incident. There has been a mounting <Col N="823"/>number of tragedies, such as that involving the <i>Pisces</i> and other vessels, which highlights the dangers that are now manifesting themselves for families around the country who depend upon fishing.</P>
      <P>Apart from my national responsibilities as a party leader, I also speak as a public representative for north County Dublin. My constituents include fishermen working out of Skerries and Balbriggan, in addition to fishing from time to time out of Rogerstown, Loughshinny and other harbours along the coast.</P>
      <P>This legislation is both vital and necessary in that we must all be reminded that fishermen are caught in a terrible, conflicting situation with less and less fish stocks together with an increasing cost base. That puts enormous pressure on them to take risks, the consequences of which can prove to be all too tragic. We are inheriting a situation, and the Minister of State&rsquo;s party was in Government at the time when this was set in stone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish fishermen have access to 16% of European waters. We are going back to the time of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 1 January 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am talking about Jack Lynch&rsquo;s time. I am going back to the time when the negotiations took place that meant the allocation for Irish fishermen was 2.9% of European waters by value. I am also looking at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resource&rsquo;s own fishery vessels safety review group report, which indicated that on average boats are more than 30 years old. Some 64% of them were found to have serious deficiencies. All too often people are putting to sea in vessels which in the cold light of day they would probably not choose to go to sea in if they could have it any other way.</P>
      <P>That is part of the reason this legislation is so important. The pressure on fishermen to go to sea is, in the words of one fisherman in my own locality, highly dangerous. I am quoting from one fisherman in the north County Dublin area who tells me that fishermen are going out to sea in unstable boats which are overloaded with technology. They are supposed to get a report from a naval architect but they do not. The boat becomes top heavy and in those circumstances it is small wonder that we have boats capsizing.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it relates to new harbours, is being welcomed by fishermen because at least we will know who is working on the boats and who is based in the harbours. Fishing is now mostly done by non-nationals, as many Irish people are not prepared to work in the conditions that apply to <Col N="824"/>fishing boats in my area, which operate in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have also been reminded of the fuel situation by fishermen. One fisherman pointed out that the fact that diesel is subsidised means it is being used in circumstances that otherwise would make one think twice. I have been given figures which show that the cost of fuel for ten days&rsquo; fishing is &euro;8,000. The catch needed to cover such costs puts such pressure on skippers and their crews that it really is surprising we do not have more tragedies at sea. When one adds the smaller returns from the industry, we can see that fishermen are facing a crisis.</P>
      <P>The other complaint I have heard about in my area is the amount of discard being created because of this pressure, particularly on larger twin-rigged trawlers. One fishermen estimates that six baskets out of every 40 are discarded, destroyed and thrown overboard. They are not even logged. Deputy O&rsquo;Shea spoke about a waste of food. If good food is thrown overboard and is not used against quotas, we in this country have a job to do to prevent this kind of wastage. In Spain, the discard is apparently used against quotas and Spanish fishermen, therefore, do not target smaller material. The Minister of State might smile at this and tell me he has other sources of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not smiling. I am listening to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder whether the Minister of State agrees with me as I received the impression he might have believed there was more information. I look forward to his reply as he might give me more details. These are the issues of which I have been informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>By Spaniards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>No, by Irish fishermen. I am relating to the Minister of State the devastated lifestyles people are coming to terms with in fishing when they see the cost of fuel going through the roof, returns on their efforts yielding smaller and smaller incomes and the overheads of keeping boats in seaworthy conditions. As the Minister of State said, and I share his view, they also must compete with Spaniards and other nationalities.</P>
      <P>Some say the main problem is that fish do not vote and fishermen do but I do not share this view. Many fishermen and trawlermen want conservation and the fair and consistent application of regulations. For example, the razor shellfish industry, which had no Government regulations placed on it and was fished off the County Meath coast around Mornington, was wiped out. That was a case where people wanted regulation but, because there was none, they decided to make whatever they could out of it while they could. It was not responsible of the Government to allow this to happen.</P><Col N="825"/>
      <P>It is the same with drift net fishermen. People ask me why the Government is so slow in falling into line with other countries in respect of a buyout. These fishermen want the Government to take action in the interests of conservation. Tourism and coastal towns will suffer the longer this foot dragging goes on. I hope the Minister of State will understand that fishermen want a clear line from Government that is consistent, enforceable and will ensure that conservation is prioritised. They know as much as any of us that, unless there are fish, there is no fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to speak on a Bill of vital importance to the fishing industry of this country. I declare my interest in that, as the House knows, I live on a peninsula with one of the largest whitefish fleets based three miles from me in Greencastle. We could debate this matter such as Deputy Sargent did, who asked whether we were sold out in the early 1970s to the advantage of agriculture. Unfortunately, we cannot get a review of the Common Fisheries Policy that would readdress matters in a way we would like.</P>
      <P>I am relieved that the guillotine to be applied to the debate has been removed. I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for the interest they have taken in what we as backbenchers have to say. When we in this Chamber deal with important legislation, we must have the opportunity to have our thoughts heard, especially on Second Stage, to ensure that issues of concern can be reviewed prior to Committee Stage and, ultimately, Report and Fifth Stages.</P>
      <P>There was concern that this Bill was being hurried; there is no need for haste. We in my area do not want to repent at leisure. In the context of legal mechanisms being in place to address the issue of illegal fishing, there is no obvious reason for undue haste. This is contrary to what has been said in some earlier commentaries which described this reforming and consolidating legislation as being: &ldquo;urgently required to ensure that Ireland could meet its obligations under EU law and sustainably manage sea fishing activity in its 200 mile zone&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have listened to much of the debate over recent weeks and I agree with many aspects, although not the previous contribution. On mad ideas such as shooting into boats, I believed the age of technology had gone beyond the need for tactics that related to ages gone by. I trust that this was a red herring. It will not distract me from the more central messages of the proposed changes. Regarding guns, I am not sure that a sea fishery officer needs either an armed garda or soldier to accompany him or her, as the Bill seems to state. Do members of our traffic corps need to be armed when they deal with motorists? I cannot see a difference between that and boats. It is an area that should be examined.</P><Col N="826"/>
      <P>Before I deal with those changes, I would like to make a fundamental point. For years our fishing fleet was the oldest in Europe. I listened to Deputy Sargent and his information is, unfortunately, out of date. In the first years after I was elected I criticised the then Government for risking the lives of fishermen by sending them out to sea in what were, in effect, potential coffins. When Fianna F&aacute;il entered Government it took on this issue and developed, in conjunction with an input from the industry, the whitefish fleet renewal programme to modernise the fleet. The Government lived up to its promises and the fishermen rose to the challenge the grant aid offered.</P>
      <P>My home port of Greencastle gained as much as any harbour and more than most. It was and is seen as a great success coupled with the decommissioning scheme for the older boats and, recently, the decommissioning and support packages for smaller boats, which Deputy Sargent seems to have overlooked. I look forward to the Minister improving the facilities, which the Government has done over recent years in places such as Greencastle, for the landing of catches. A decline in the quotas for the sector occurred almost simultaneously. This was linked to the declining fish stocks and the need for management and approaches that would yield a sustainable fishery in future.</P>
      <P>The fundamental issue is that we have fishermen who have invested heavily in good, safe boats that will take them to the fishing grounds to which others had the capacity to go to safely. However, now that they have mortgages for their boats, we say they cannot fish. I understand the concerns of Deputy Sargent and others about the issue of sustainable development, which is an issue for fishermen as much as anyone else. I understand the concepts of preserving and protecting and that not everyone has been scrupulous in his or her approach to what size of fish has been caught.</P>
      <P>I also understand that when fishermen in my area proposed closing off particular areas in the early 1990s that were known as spawning or juvenile areas to protect stocks, both fishing organisations and the Department gave the impression that because 15 states needed to agree to the measure, it would be impossible. Our fishermen were ahead of their time as closed areas and times are now becoming acceptable. We are now learning what those in the north west were talking about 15 years ago. As such, what is this Bill about? Is it a big stick or a mechanism to aid the fishermen by increasing fines for illegal fishing to extraordinary levels when they are already European leaders? Does it help in any constructive manner the management of our fishery or does it ensure that officialdom can point to how seriously we take breaches of quotas?</P>
      <P>The man in his new boat with his crew is at sea for more than a week and has told certain species of fish to stay out of his nets as he is not allowed to catch them. He is concentrating on a box of <Col N="827"/>one species and half a box of something else. What happens? The fish do not listen to him and when he pulls up his nets he has dead incursions, so to speak, from these forbidden fish. If he is boarded, he is brought to shore. Even though most of his stock is legal, he will be referred to the Circuit Court. By this definition, his gear and catch will be confiscated, his boat will be bonded and he will either lose days fishing or pay the bond. He must then get legal representation for the court case.</P>
      <P>I have heard stories of people having in the region of &euro;5,000 worth of illegal fish on board that they refused to throw out. Deputy Sargent spoke about wasting dead fish. Research suggests that these fish should be brought on board as part of the recognised catch.</P>
      <P>The fisherman might have a small number of illegal fish on board. He pays his crew, for food and fuel, after which he must buy new gear, pay for the loss of catch, days at sea and legal fees apart from the fines. He is practically put out of business by the sheer multiple nature of the value of all that compared with the amount of fish concerned in the initial arrest. This may come across as anecdotal and perhaps it is, but the current punishment does not fit the crime and this is my fundamental point. Increasing the level of fine will no more add to the debate or address the core issue.</P>
      <P>This leads me to say bluntly that a mechanism must be found to treat different breaches in different ways. If there are minor breaches of our road traffic laws, there should be a type of on-the-spot fine so that one can either pay or choose to fight the case in court. In traffic offences it is understood that if one admits one was in the wrong, one can get off lighter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The sixth ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation will take place in Hong Kong from 13 to 18 December 2005. Hong Kong is not the end point of the current round of WTO negotiations and it was never intended as such. However, it will be an important milestone which will register progress in the Doha development agenda negotiations and as such provide a decisive step and create the right basis for the final and decisive stages of negotiations with a view to concluding the round late in 2006 or early 2007. It is therefore an important and timely meeting.</P>
      <P>I propose to map out recent developments chronologically now that we are in the last <Col N="828"/>straight before Hong Kong. I will then provide analysis of the issues that arise under the core areas of the DDA negotiations and Ireland&rsquo;s position on each, before concluding with the current state of play in the lead-in to Hong Kong.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">The Doha Round was launched in November 2001 as a broad-based round across a full spectrum of core areas of agriculture, industrial goods and services and included a strong development dimension aimed at assisting developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, integrate into the world trading system. Substantial mandates are also aimed at streamlining and further strengthening WTO rules, in the areas of special and differential treatment and on implementation issues. Ireland fully supported the launch of a broad based multilateral round which is regarded as the best way to address the challenges resulting from significant and far-reaching economic and technological changes, promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Although at its launch, the round was scheduled to conclude by January 2005, this did not prove possible for several reasons. The fifth WTO conference, in Canc&uacute;n, failed to progress the negotiations and this resulted in a prolonged period of inactivity during which, for example, the EU conducted a detailed reflection of its strategic approach to WTO negotiations.</P>
      <P>Effectively, the DDA negotiations were re-launched in July 2004, when the WTO membership adopted a framework agreement across core areas of the negotiations as a basis for a final decisive push to conclude a successful round. The EU&rsquo;s acceptance of the objective of the abolition of agricultural export subsidies, on the basis of parallel reform by other WTO members of their competing subsidies, coupled with the continued reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, was the major impetus towards reaching the July agreement.</P>
      <P>Key elements of the July 2004 framework, endorsed by the WTO membership, included the following. In agriculture, WTO members agreed to substantially cut trade distorting farm supports, to eliminate trade distorting export competition practices and to a significant opening of agricultural markets. In industrial goods the framework agreement introduced a set of precise guidelines to cut tariffs and in services it set a fixed date tor the submission of improved offers.</P>
      <P>For development it represented positive progress given the proposed elimination of export subsidies, less agricultural subsidies and market access improvements, which was combined with a strong call for duty-free and quota-free access for the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. It calls for a re-enforcement of the disciplines on special and differential treatment in favour of developing countries.</P><Col N="829"/>
      <P>The July 2004 agreement also saw the launch of negotiations to simplify customs procedures otherwise known as trade facilitation. It was agreed that in the months following the July 2004 framework agreement, WTO members would further develop the framework into concrete, detailed and specific commitments and figures with a view to completing the round as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that negotiations in the 18 months since the framework agreement have been slow. More recently, however, there has been a renewed impetus in the DDA negotiations and a flurry of activity with the submission of offers by key WTO members, in particular, the United States. The EU, for its part, tabled a revised conditional offer on 28 October.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the EU offer on agriculture proposes high tariff cuts especially in the higher tariffs, a very substantial cut in trade distorting domestic supports to the extent the EU has reached the limit of its bargaining position, and a commitment to the total elimination of export refunds by an agreed date if other WTO members eliminate their export subsidies in parallel. Finally, there is a firm commitment to differential treatment for developing countries.</P>
      <P>The WTO negotiations on agriculture have been a hot topic, in both Geneva and Brussels, of late. A key focus of the debate has been the need to ensure balance between the key areas of the DDA. At the heart of the EU mandate is the imperative for balance within and between the pillars of agriculture and the other core areas of the DDA negotiations, most notably in the areas of industrial goods and services, while ensuring the delivery of the development dimension of the round. Ireland, together with a number of other EU member states and, in particular, France, has insisted at all times during the negotiations on agriculture that the European Commission negotiates within the ambit of the agricultural mandate adopted by EU Council of Ministers. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Ministers of State will highlight in their statement to the House developments in the DDA agriculture negotiations.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress again that the EU&rsquo;s offer to our trading partners was explicitly made conditional on the movement by other WTO members in areas of the DDA negotiations of particular interest to the European Union outside of agriculture. Thus, EU member states are seeking reciprocal commitments from other WTO members in a range of areas across the full spectrum of the DDA, most notably in respect of improved market access for European exporters in industrial goods and internationally traded services sectors.</P>
      <P>As regards industrial goods, EU member states are pressing for the adoption of a formula that will drive down tariffs. The use of this formula will help compress tariff ranges and get rid of high and escalating tariffs. The most recent talks <Col N="830"/>in Geneva confirm an increasing convergence among the WTO membership, with large WTO majority support for entering negotiations to cut tariffs on this basis.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the thrust of the EU approach in the industrial tariff negotiations which are in line with our broad objectives for the round. From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we have strong strategic commercial interests and ambitions in securing tariff reductions across a broad range of sectors, including in the areas of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, ICT and related electronic machinery sectors. In addition to tariff reduction, Ireland supports proposals to seek reductions in or elimination of non-tariff barriers which have the potential to limit trade. These include, for example, unfair licensing regimes, costly labelling requirements or complex certification techniques. Under the Doha Round, we would like to see a renewed and strong commitment to identify and remove unjustified non-tariff barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it possible for the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to be circulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It should have been circulated. I am sorry about that.</P>
      <P>There is a strong development dimension to the core negotiations on industrial goods. Thus, the request for market opening by the EU is being modulated to reflect the level of development of the country to whom the request is directed. The request is not designed to disadvantage poorer developing counties. In the first place, on industrial tariffs, the EU is proposing that there should be differentiated tariff reduction commitments between developed and developing countries. Poorer developing countries, for example, will be offered flexibilities such as less than formula cuts and longer transition periods before implementation of commitments. Additionally, least developed countries, under EU proposals, are not being asked to reduce tariffs. This differentiated approach of non-reciprocation is a key element of the EU&rsquo;s determination to deliver the development dimension of the Doha Round which Ireland fully supports.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the services negotiations. These negotiations are being conducted under the terms of the WTO&rsquo;s General Agreement on Trade in Services, known as the GATS negotiations. The EU is concerned at the poor quality, for the most part, of the GATS offers that have been tabled to date by key trading partners. The EU has a relatively open and liberal services market and would wish to see reciprocal market opening from our main trading partners, including developed countries and the more advanced developing countries such as Brazil, India and China.</P>
      <P>Essentially, EU member states including Ireland, are seeking better market access and a more transparent and predictable environment <Col N="831"/>for European service suppliers in third country markets. Ireland supports an ambitious approach in requesting service sector liberalisation across the full range of internationally traded services sectors, including construction and related engineering, financial services and professional business and distribution services, to name but a few. New commitments by all WTO members in services areas would help open up foreign markets for Irish and other EU service providers and expand services employment. Moreover, improved WTO services disciplines might also benefit Irish consumers by increasing the level of competition in the provision of professional and other types of services in the domestic Irish market without compromising other valid public policy objectives such as consumer protection, prudential regulation and universal provision.</P>
      <P>I emphasise, however, that it is not the intention of the EU, nor has the EU submitted in the context of the current negotiations requests to other WTO members, to seek market opening commitments on public services such as in the areas of health and education. We are not seeking to undermine the pursuit by WTO member countries of legitimate public policy objectives. Ireland fully supports this approach.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The successful delivery of the development dimension of the Doha agenda is also extremely important to Ireland and EU member states. There are several areas on which Hong Kong must deliver. Apart from the benefits to be achieved by developing countries which will flow from the conclusion of successful negotiations in the core areas of the Doha Round, a package of measures also needs to be concluded. This substantive package of measures should include duty free and quota free market access for the least developed countries; levels of market access commitments by developing countries linked to their level of development; a package of agreement specific proposals for special and differential treatment and implementation issues; and measures to strengthen trade related assistance.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will also make a statement to the House on the development aspects of the DDA negotiations and how these might be best delivered.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to make special mention of one particular aspect of the DDA negotiations related to the delivery of the development dimension. The world&rsquo;s poorest countries have not always been able to benefit fully from the trade opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system. A key conclusion drawn by the EU from the period of reflection following the failure at Canc&uacute;n was that a more serious focus should be placed on finding solutions to the problems experienced by the most vulnerable members of the WTO. These include least developed countries, small econom<Col N="832"/>ies, land-locked developing countries and any others particularly vulnerable to economic shocks, with particularly weak economies or infrastructure, or which remain highly dependent on preferential access and revenues from tariffs. These members are in the greatest need of flexibility in the application of WTO rules, of development aid to remedy supply side weaknesses and of measures to improve their access to markets.</P>
      <P>Current proposals from the EU across the core areas of agriculture, goods and services market access seek to reflect this strategic approach of differentiation, which I commend. Such an approach, apart from its inherent value, could, for example, mitigate the negative impact on poorer countries of the loss of preferences on exports to developed countries, such as those of the EU. Developing countries could offer these poorer countries a level of duty free and quota free access, along the lines of the EU&rsquo;s generalised system of preferences, commensurate with their level of development and in this way enhance south-south trade.</P>
      <P>I outlined some of the key areas of interest and issues of importance to Ireland of success in the DDA negotiations to the House. Ireland&rsquo;s priority in these negotiations has been and is to see the process of trade liberalisation continue in a fair and balanced way and to support the strengthening of the World Trade Organisation in its provision of a stable and consistent framework for the regulation of world trade. Central to our approach, and that of the European Union, is a commitment to respond positively in the negotiations to the concerns and ambitions of the developing world. This is an essential part of the Doha agenda.</P>
      <P>Overall, Ireland, along with our EU partners, is of the view that maintaining a strong World Trade Organisation is of fundamental importance to meet the economic and trade challenges ahead. The policy approach going into Hong Kong should not and will not change. In the absence of agreeing on full modalities in Hong Kong, it is expected that Ministers will take stock of the progress in the DDA negotiations since the July 2004 framework agreement and set the scene for the resumption of an intensive follow-up phase of negotiations early in 2006 with a view to concluding the round as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s approach to Hong Kong, as with other EU member states, is based on three principles. First, we want to make as much progress as possible across the core areas of the negotiations without locking in any imbalances that may currently exist. All areas of the DDA must display a similar level of progress and a degree of specificity. To that end we must maintain the momentum with WTO partners. Second, the EU must preserve the overall level of ambition for the final outcome of the Doha round, including realisable gains for the EU in agriculture, industrial tariffs and services. Third, we must preserve and project <Col N="833"/>the development objectives of the round by agreeing a development package at Hong Kong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleague Deputy Crawford for calling for this debate and the Government for allowing statements. This is a crucial issue for Ireland. The WTO talks are of enormous importance to Europe and Ireland and are vital as regards what is happening in developing countries. The House should keep a watchful brief on what happens in Hong Kong in terms of whether progress is being made in concluding successful negotiations as regards the Doha Round.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of the agricultural issues, it is easy to see why other non-farming issues have dropped off the Irish radar. The issue of food security is of enormous importance to everyone in this country &mdash; farmers, processors and consumers alike. It is vital that the WTO process results in the production of good quality, safe food, traded fairly, with all farmers&rsquo; livelihoods protected and transparent production methods as the norm. All countries, Ireland in particular, want a level playing pitch in terms of the country of origin and the labelling of our food. The central message I want to convey as regards the WTO is that it is important that we make progress and get a conclusion. We need to achieve certainty as regards the trade regime that operates right across the world.</P>
      <P>The European Union has made substantial change to its Common Agricultural Policy and in the process has created uncertainty for local farming communities. The then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, indicated when the CAP was being reviewed in 2003 that the issue of decoupling and single farm payments, which were to free up the administration of the system while guaranteeing food supply, would not be tampered with thereafter until 2013. A year later a further review of the Common Agricultural Policy was being carried out. That creates uncertainly. However, the EU Council of Agricultural Ministers came up with a very bold initiative last week in wiping out an entire commodity as regards the deal they reached on sugar beet. I know the Minister of State will be conscious of this as regards his own area. The attitude of the IFA seemed to be to take the loot and run, forgetting about the consequences for a commercial agricultural operation that is an important sources of income nationally for farmers. It is also an important source of employment for people who work in the processing centres in Mallow and other parts of the country. I was surprised that commercial agriculture was sacrificed in the way it was by the vested interests and the Minister. The shake-out that has taken place industry-wide was pre-empted by Greencore in the closure of the Carlow sugar beet plant in my constituency and the fact that we have surrendered to the reality that there will be high levels of importation from Brazil and third countries. <Col N="834"/>There is a mistaken belief that this will be helpful to the developing countries of Africa. Equally, they will be flooded with cheap products unless a suitable trade liberalisation agreement is negotiated in Hong Kong or during the next round of the talks.</P>
      <P>The leading economies are quite aggressive in terms of penetrating markets and in the economies of scale they can achieve for many food products which are being dumped, not only in Africa, but in many parts of the European Union. That is all I have to say about agriculture because Deputies Naughten and Connaughton will have more to say on this subject later. Nonetheless I was anxious to make those preliminary points. I wish to concentrate more on the non-agricultural issues.</P>
      <P>I want to express my disappointment at the entire way decisions are made at WTO level. Globalisation is an economic reality and yet we still lack a streamlined and sensible way of making it work to the advantage of everybody. It is not sustainable to have world leaders questioning each others &mdash; mandates, public squabbles within and between national and international governments and overly-long negotiation schedules that regularly collapse in disarray, creating the gloom of failure that lingers for months and years afterwards.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as a small nation which does not pose any economic threat to the major world economies, can act as an honest broker in proposing a suite of reforms that would simplify the process, speed up decision making, enshrine fairness and, most importantly, protect the less well off, be they African or Irish farmers, Asian or European workers.</P>
      <P>Ireland has approached these talks on the basis of support for the continuation of trade liberalisation. This is, on the whole, a sound policy. Ireland has benefited greatly from the trend towards liberalisation. Notwithstanding the recent disgusting developments in Irish Ferries, which has disgracefully, circumvented our employee protection laws, I believe we have established in this country through minimum wage legislation a system that has allowed for a huge increase in the number of non-nationals working here without the degree of exploitation that other economies have experienced. However, it is an issue to be watched carefully. We must ensure in the integration of migrant workers that people feel welcome, enjoy normal relations in society and are allowed to reach their full potential as individuals, without the type of exploitation we have seen in other jurisdictions. We want to ensure such people are part of our society and not just an adjunct to our country. Otherwise, we will reap the worst excesses of employee exploitation, marginalisation and racism.</P>
      <P>Open markets are a good deal for Ireland. They allow the flow of foreign direct investment to create employment and have, for example, <Col N="835"/>allowed this country to become a world leader in areas such as financial services and information technology. They also allow Irish exporters &mdash; indigenous businesses included &mdash; to sell their wares at a fair price to large numbers of people.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State has said, the WTO agenda is three-fold. It examines domestic supports, export refunds and market access. While much movement has been made on the first two issues, it is the third issue on which much remains to be done. I am at one with the position of the EU on areas of non-agricultural interest. The EU is proposing a progressive formula that cuts applied tariffs, reducing developed country applied tariffs by up to 80%. In services, the EU wants to see negotiations complemented by ambitious mandatory country targets for the service sector to be liberalised. The Department has stated it too shares the EU focus on the level of tariff cuts which will offer real opportunities for our exporters.</P>
      <P>With regard to internationally traded services, Ireland and the other EU states are seeking non-public service sector liberalisation in other WTO members, which is a move that would benefit Irish consumers by increasing the level of competition in the provision of professional services in domestic markets. This point is of vital importance to Ireland as we live in a high cost economy. We are hearing from bodies such as the National Competitiveness Council about the difficulties we face due to our cost base.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of my party for several years to promote a single European insurance market. Movement on this would be made all the easier were agreement to be reached at WTO level. Indeed, the momentum toward such a market could even become unstoppable were agreement reached. Consumers here would benefit and Irish companies would be free to compete in other markets. In my view, they could compete strongly.</P>
      <P>Trade unions have made the point that the outcome of negotiations could undermine the universal service obligations of governments and the capacity to regulate crucial aspects of the market. This should be borne in mind by all sides, though it should not act as a barrier to progress. Credence should also be given to the call for a clarifying statement on behalf of those involved in the general agreement on trade and services with regard to the twin &mdash; sometimes contradictory &mdash; aims of liberalisation and regulation. This is of critical importance to poor countries and small countries, both rich and poor. Our susceptibility to outside economic forces means the Government must be free to take a lead, encourage or even cajole and legislate to protect national and consumer interests and not simply subscribe to a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach that is not in its interest.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the commitment to economic liberalisation, there must be a concerted effort to <Col N="836"/>bring about changes in how developing countries are treated so that we can unlock the cage of global poverty and ensure the benefits of trade are increased and spread more evenly. I acknowledge that this is easier said than done. We cannot enjoy our prosperity on the back of suffering in Africa, no more than we can enjoy prosperity in parts of this country on the back of poverty in other parts of Ireland. The recent Make Poverty History and Live 8 campaigns show how seriously people take continued poverty and misery in the developed world. The debate is also framed against the background of Ireland&rsquo;s evolution from economic basket case to one of the richest countries in the world. Ireland was never really that poor when compared with the poverty in developing countries. The history of the State since independence has never been marred by hunger or starvation, though famine occurred in the 19th century. This viewpoint &mdash; from the Great Famine to the Celtic tiger &mdash; should give Ireland a uniquely compassionate view amongst our partners in the EU and the developed world in general.</P>
      <P>I thank the Trade Matters group for bringing vital justice issues to the attention of legislators and other organisations in the run up to the talks. The group has rightly highlighted the fact that the quest for a free market must be tempered by the quest for a fair market. The EU and Ireland have also highlighted the need for the economic freedom and strength of poor countries. I would like to raise a number of issues that Trade Matters highlighted. Governments must ensure that trade policies do not exacerbate existing inequalities, impede the achievement of the millennium development goals or the implementation of international agreements on human rights, gender equality and labour standards. The EU wants a range of proposals, including a trade related assistance package, to be offered to least developed countries and agreement that all developed countries extend tariff and quota free access to all of those countries no later than the conclusion of the Doha development agenda. The problems facing the African continent are huge due to malnutrition, war and stagnant economies. Too often these problems have been written off as one of those things. The developed world, through a trade system that encompasses the concept of social justice &mdash; a concept with which my party is very familiar &mdash; can kick-start the process that will end those problems.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Trade Matters and other NGOs have raised the issue of transparency and democracy in the WTO process. Many of these side deals and bilateral agreements in smoke filled rooms are insufficient to assist people who are not armed with the level of financial might or professional strength required to make their case to the best possible extent to other countries. The repercussions of the Hong Kong meeting &mdash; be it a success or failure &mdash; will be huge. We must continue to ensure we have a multilateral trading approach. Otherwise the weaker developing countries will have <Col N="837"/>no chance against the larger economies. The outcome will affect economies, societies and the global environment. It is absolutely essential that Ireland plays its part and that the worthy objectives of the EU in non-agricultural areas are promoted as much as those in the agricultural areas, that the European economy is strengthened and the poorest people in the world are saved from a lifetime of poverty and economic slavery. They must be given hope that we are adhering to their agenda. I wish the Minister of State and his team the best of luck in the coming weeks and remind him that Fine Gael is available to help at all times, through its contacts in the European People's Party, in order to enhance the agenda that has been articulated in this House today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in advance of the ministerial round of the WTO in Hong Kong. Too often, this House debates these matters at the conclusion of talks. The structure of these talks is extremely complicated and we are grateful to the various organisations that advised us on a moral agenda that should emerge from the next round.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party believes in a multilateral trade system. We are concerned at the growing tide of unilateralism that causes disadvantage to the weakest. However, the multilateral trade system must have a set of objectives that are firm, that are known and that are moral. The Labour Party regards a number of these objectives to be vital. First, the objective of full and equal employment must be high on our agenda. With the developments in our own market economy in recent weeks, that becomes all the more relevant to us. It must extend to all economies and not just the developed economies. The second objective is to support strongly the millennium development goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The nation committed itself to those goals when we signed up to them at the UN. We should not be trying to weaken those objectives through international organisations such as the WTO. The third objective must be to foster sustainable development. Since the Rio process in the 1990s, sustainability has been an important part of the international agenda. It seemed to lose steam in recent times, but sustainability must be at the heart of all of our trade negotiations and our trade deals.</P>
      <P>The fourth objective is to commit ourselves to poverty eradication in every country, including the developed countries, in order to build greater cohesion and less polarity between income groups, both within developed economies and between developed and developing economies. In short, our objective must be the effective management of so-called globalisation for the benefit of all.</P><Col N="838"/>
      <P>The success of the WTO has the potential to lift millions of people across the world out of poverty. Trade liberalisation can confer great benefits on developing countries, which can become further integrated into the world trading system. However, they must have the capacity to properly and effectively avail of this development. Therefore, they must have the infrastructure to take advantage of the potentials of trade access. Otherwise, that very access might place heavy burdens on them. Hence, we must guard against complicated trade regulations, red tape and a lack of institutional capacities, which can constitute real barriers, to developing countries in particular, taking full advantage of the potential of liberalised trade.</P>
      <P>In the short time available, I want to mention a few issues. Ireland&rsquo;s stated position is for an ambitious outcome to the Hong Kong ministerial round, although some of the recent presentations to the relevant joint committee have adopted a pessimistic tone. Nevertheless, we must have ambitions to include rights and a rights-based approach in a final negotiating position. While negotiations will not conclude in Hong Kong, a concrete agenda to conclude early in 2006 might be set, with a view to concluding the round in its entirety by the end of 2006 or early 2007. We know how important trade is for Ireland.</P>
      <P>As time is short, I want to mention multilateralism briefly. The current thrust of some bilateral discussions, particularly between the United States and some African countries, whereby trade access is linked to and supports other foreign policy agenda items of the United States, is an extremely worrying development. The European Union must protect the notion of global responsibility and a multilateral approach to these matters.</P>
      <P>While there is a number of important issues for Ireland, I want to touch briefly on agriculture, which will be dealt with in detail by our spokesperson, Deputy Upton. I will refer to the sugar agreement reached last week to illustrate the complications attached to these matters. I met Lesotho&rsquo;s Minister for Industry and Marketing, Mr. Mpho Malie, during the week and I wish to share his perspective on this complicated issue as he provided an example of the impact which the sugar agreement will have on developing countries in his region. He mentioned Swaziland and Mauritius, with which he has been in direct contact. Both countries have preferential trading rights within the European Union, under the Cotonou Agreement, or under the general system of preferences. The agreement has inflicted a devastating blow on them, because heretofore, they were able to sell their sugar at EU prices. That option will no longer be open to them. Like many other ACP countries, they must share a token compensation package, which I understand will come to approximately &euro;40 million. Ireland alone will receive &euro;400 million &mdash; which is welcome &mdash; in compensation for our industry. Hence, even <Col N="839"/>deals which are presented as being fair to developing countries, may not be so. We must be guarded and careful in ensuring that least-developed countries are protected. Any progress already made to give such countries market access at European level prices, through the institutions of the European Union itself and the Cotonou Agreement, must be protected and respected in any broader global arrangement.</P>
      <P>The stated objective of Ireland is to ensure full agreement within the WTO, without further reform of the CAP. Most Members would subscribe to that, because implementation of the CAP reform agreement is still incomplete. As a final comment in respect of agriculture, those representatives of the agricultural sector to whom I have spoken are concerned that the lead negotiator for the European Union is the Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson. Recognition of the importance of agriculture differs in each of the European Union member states. I have been involved in international negotiations and I know how difficult it is to have an input once negotiations are underway. This is because they are conducted through the European Union. The Council operates in permanent session, moulding what has become an extremely complicated mix of views from 25 states into a single negotiating position. However, I wish the Minister well in protecting Ireland&rsquo;s position, while having the generosity to ensure the dependence of the developing world on agriculture is fully recognised.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the non-agricultural market access, NAMA, issue. As an exporting country, Ireland wants ambitious market-opening opportunities for all our exports, particularly in respect of opportunities for the pharmaceuticals, chemicals, information technology and electronics sectors. There is a focus on the level of reductions on tariffs applied to Irish-produced product being exported to Third World countries. My point in respect of NAMA is that all these negotiations are taking place in different rooms. Hence the NAMA conclusions will be drawn up in one room and the agricultural ones in another. We should monitor the balance between the two so we do not sell our agricultural positions for the benefit of NAMA or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      <P>As for internationally traded services, it is important that public services are not, and should not be part of GATS. This is particularly important for developing countries. I had intended to mention gender issues, as an important presentation has been made in this respect by Ban&uacute;lacht. Perhaps one of my colleagues will be able to cover the issue. I wish the Minister well in the negotiations and look forward to having an input through the parliamentary tier in the Oireachtas. I hope there will be open consultations with all the interested parties, including the NGOs, in Hong Kong as the negotiations progress.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="840"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will concentrate my comments entirely on the agricultural aspects of the WTO. In recent weeks, there have been suggestions from some quarters that because agriculture accounts for a tiny percentage of the world economy, disagreement over agricultural aspects of WTO agreements must not be allowed to derail the entire agreement. I believe this is fundamentally flawed. First, the mindset that views agriculture solely through the guise of its economic significance to the world economy as a whole is flawed. It is a mindset that refuses to recognise that agriculture feeds us all and which refuses to recognise that the economic importance of agriculture to a subsistence farmer in the developing world is vastly greater than it would be even to a poor farmer in Ireland. In the developing world, farming is not a choice of occupation. It is the only way in which one can obtain the food one&rsquo;s family needs to eat.</P>
      <P>This view is also flawed because it uses agriculture as an excuse for failures to find agreement in other areas. The chairman of the negotiating group of the WTO in a crucial area outside of agriculture, namely, market access, reports that the establishment of full modalities is at present a difficult prospect, given the lack of agreement on a number of elements. Hence, it is not simply a lack of agreement on agriculture which is holding matters up, despite what one might have been led to believe.</P>
      <P>A third reason why the &ldquo;everything but agriculture is important&rdquo; view is flawed is because in its quest for an agreement in favour of their own economic interests, proponents of this mindset overlook the necessity to make any prospective agreements poverty, inequality, human rights, labour standards and environmental-proofed. Accepting an agreement which is not so proofed, even with agreement on agricultural aspects, would be a colossal misjudgment.</P>
      <P>This is not to downplay the enormous significance of the failure to reach an agreement on concluding all aspects of the WTO&rsquo;s objectives as stated in the Doha declaration of November 2001. Ambassador Falconer, the New Zealand chairman of the agriculture negotiations, notes in the draft ministerial declaration text of November 2005 the acceptance at a recent delegation meeting that full modalities, that is, the assignment of specific numerical values and formulae for tariff cuts, will not be achieved in Hong Kong. An agreement will be reached in Hong Kong but, judging from the text of the draft ministerial declaration of 26 November, it will be incomplete.</P>
      <P>I can think of no greater example of the obstacles to full agreement than the lacuna Mr. Falconer notes between the respective positions of the United States and the European Union on tariff cutting. This issue is very important to Ireland. The European Union has indicated it could be prepared to make cuts of as much as 70% provided the US makes cuts of 60%. However, the United States will agree to 60% <Col N="841"/>only if the European Union agrees to 83%. I am thankful that the European Union is not willing to do this, probably not for Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s want of trying.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In one or two respects, the failure to fulfil the potential of the Doha Round is a great pity, but in other respects it is not such a great tragedy. The failure to agree modalities in respect of export competition or subsidies, domestic support and market access means once again that the postponement of the conclusion of the work programme of the World Trade Organisation, as agreed at Doha, represents a setback for the organisation. It is also a setback for those who hope free trade can assist development and for those who were prepared to sell out European farmers to achieve agreement at any cost. However, Irish farmers will not weep at this failure, nor should they. They have made great sacrifices over recent years and continue to do so. Few would shirk making some sacrifices if there were corresponding gains for our brethren in the developing world. However, even if agreement on full trade liberalisation had been reached at WTO level, the farmers of the developing world would not have gained most. They had very little to gain from the Doha Round.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Doha Round is often referred to as the development round and some would say its apparent concentration on development aims to balance the huge losses developing countries suffered after the Uruguay Round. By losses, I mean the vast, brave and unreciprocated concessions these countries made in terms of opening up their internal markets for services, including financial services, and intellectual property.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The failure of the Doha Round relative to its objectives, and the imminent Doha ministerial declaration, is not necessarily bad for farmers of the developing world. World Bank estimates of the income effects of merchandise-trade liberalisation predict that, in the worst case scenario, the developed world would make gains of US$65.6 billion, while the developing countries would gain US$9 billion and sub-Saharan Africa would gain US$300 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate and am pleased to speak in it. I watched a television programme recently in which Bob Geldof explained the background to the Live 8 concerts this summer. He made the very simple point, of which we are all aware, that our understanding of development and the connections between the developed and developing worlds has changed in the past 20 years. We have moved from concentrating on the need to give aid to a position in which we collectively believe we should not only give aid but also ensure justice in the trading and other mechanisms that exist between the developing and developed worlds.</P>
      <P>Ireland needs to move on in this regard. Much attention has rightly been paid to the failure of the Government to live up to its commitment to <Col N="842"/>meet the UN development goals. That is a very important political issue but the subject we are debating today, that is, the position the Minister should adopt on behalf of the people in the negotiations in Hong Kong, is equally if not more important. It makes no sense for us to give development aid to countries while taking from them in other respects.</P>
      <P>I am very impressed with the trade officials who take part in the negotiations on our behalf. On speaking to them, I noted they are decent, hard-working and very competent. However, when one analyses how we negotiate, it seems they and perhaps the Government, which they represent more than anyone else, are unable to move beyond the traditional dictum that applies in international negotiations to the effect that one should look after one&rsquo;s own interests. If one asks questions on particular policy areas, one will note that self-interest is ultimately the bottom line that has guided us in negotiations of this kind. This is out of line and wrong. It is not in accord with our collective view that there is a need to secure justice in the trade negotiations in which we take part.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Listening only to those protecting both vested interests and a <i>status quo</i> that does not work effectively in this country and kills people in other countries at the same time should not inform our negotiating position in Hong Kong and elsewhere. We need to move towards a new paradigm and participate genuinely in trying to make the Doha Round a development round rather than one that serves our interests. As sure as eggs are eggs, if there are negotiations in which the powerful and rich in this country follow their own interests, the poor, who have fewer resources and less ability to enforce rules that would benefit them, will end up disenfranchised and worse off, as has been the outcome of so many of the previous WTO rounds.</P>
      <P>By taking this more generous and just approach to negotiations, we will still benefit ourselves. The <i>status quo </i>does not provide us with the wealth and security we seek in our economy. It is wrong for us to go to Hong Kong or elsewhere to protect an agricultural system that does not work and to justify export subsidies that are immoral and greatly destructive in the very countries we are trying to develop by way of development aid granted by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan. We need to separate the different strands of this issue. I do not agree with the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, that we need a balance between our agricultural position and that on services and industrial access. We need to do what is right, that is, abolish the export subsidies that do such harm rather than huddle with the French at the negotiations in Hong Kong and try to prevent progress. We should be willing to give. This would be a progressive step for Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>I am committed utterly to our making a switch in energy policy. There are approximately 21 <Col N="843"/>renewable energy technologies to which we can turn, most of which could be provided by Irish farmers who would develop an enterprising market of real value and generate real income in a way that would benefit poorer countries. The use of such technologies would reduce emissions.</P>
      <P>Environmental justice and development justice are inextricably linked. The negotiations proceeding in Montreal and Hong Kong are connected. Our pollution and emissions put at risk the lives of the 2 billion poorest people on the planet who live closest to nature. If nature changes because of our activities, these people are put at risk. The poorest countries will have an opportunity to improve their lot if what I propose is acted upon because the mechanisms developed to solve climate change will recognise that those countries which have not being polluting have the ability to trade their way out of poverty. They will be able to raise their emission levels while developed countries will have to make cuts.</P>
      <P>The solutions environmentalists espouse are free trade solutions. We believe permit trading and other mechanisms will achieve the necessary balance. We are not against free trade but it must be fair and just. While protecting our vested interests, we should take the lead in this regard, as Bob Geldof, Bono and other Irish people have done. Our politicians should follow suit because that is what the Irish people want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Irish farmers have many concerns regarding the World Trade Organisation. They centre above all on Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals to place the Common Agricultural Policy on the table as part of a deal. There are also concerns over the opening up of EU markets to beef from third countries and the implications of trade liberalisation for the Irish sugar beet sector.</P>
      <P>Any effort to interfere with the single farm payment must be resisted strenuously. I am glad to note that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has stressed she is adopting this line and that she has the support of other Ministers responsible for agriculture. CAP reform and the introduction of decoupling were to remove farm payments from the negotiations on the basis that they would no longer be regarded as trade distorting subsidies. Farmers were also given a definite commitment that no attempt would be made to interfere with the CAP budget until at least 2013. These commitments must be honoured and this must be made clear to Commissioner Mandelson.</P>
      <P>There are those who will argue that European agriculture is over-protected and unfairly discriminates against developing countries. That argument has an element of truth but there is also an element of an attempt to morally blackmail farmers into bearing the brunt of changes allegedly being made in the interests of developing countries. We must ask ourselves, therefore, who <Col N="844"/>benefits from completely open markets and free trade. Will primary producers in the developing countries benefit materially from the opening up of the EU sugar market, for example? Will they be paid higher prices for their produce or will they see the benefits accrue to the corporations that dominate international trade and who plan to undercut EU producers on the basis that they are able to produce at much less cost due to the fact that they get their produce from subsistence producers?</P>
      <P>It is also a fact that EU producers must comply with regulations on food safety and the environment and with other regulations that do not apply to commercial interests in the developing world. That is a particular issue with regard to the import of meat, for example, from Brazil. This has been argued in this House on numerous occasions. It is interesting to note, too, that while advocates of free trade in Europe and the United States claim that free trade is in the interests of developing nations, the majority of those nations are arguing for the right to retain certain tariffs and subsidies in the interests of food security and rural development.</P>
      <P>Many developed countries, including the pre-enlargement member states and this State, used tariffs, subsidies and active investment policies to develop their economies. Developing countries must be allowed to employ the same type of measures, not least because to unleash powerful western economic interests on economies that are simply unable to compete is manifestly unjust. Sinn F&eacute;in demands that this State and the EU work with other WTO members to allow developing countries to use trade policies that support their vulnerable farmers and local industries and to allow countries to choose the best policies for poor people and for environmental services such as water, health and education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>When the World Trade Organisation launched the current round of trade negotiations at Doha in 2001 Ministers named it a development round to address the concerns of poorer countries. However, the negotiations process since then suggests that the outcome might further tilt the balance against the poor. The European Union sought this round of negotiations as a development round but it is now attempting to row back. This must not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>When trade Ministers meet in Hong Kong in December 2005 they must ensure that the World Trade Organisation achieves the objective of a development round. This will mean prioritising issues of concern to developing countries and dealing with these issues on the basis of the less than full reciprocity principle. Special and differential treatment must be applied to more than extended implementation timeframes to include the right of developing countries to determine that the rate of liberalisation is commensurate with their national development policies.</P><Col N="845"/>
      <P>In this context, Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade must be amended to ensure that developing countries can continue to receive development co-operation in the form of preferential market access from industrial countries. The G8 leaders in Scotland said that developing countries should be able to choose their economic policies. That was the commitment and in Hong Kong developing countries must be given the freedom to do so. To ensure that the outcomes of the round enable the poorest countries to gain from the world trading regime policy, governments must ensure that trade policies do not exacerbate existing inequalities, impede the achievement of the millennium development goals or the implementation of agreements on human rights and, in particular, gender equality and labour standards. At a more fundamental level, the mandate and mechanisms of the World Trade Organisation must be revised to ensure the promotion of a trade regime which fosters poverty elimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The world trade negotiations we are discussing today commenced in 2001 with an expectation that they would conclude in January 2005. The target date for completion is now the second half of 2006. The danger is that if that target date is not met, it is likely that the major players will move towards negotiating bilateral or regional agreements. That would not particularly suit Ireland and the development aim of the current round would be lost, which would not be in the interest of the poorer countries. It is also likely that the interests of the poorer countries will not be dealt with if the multilateral approach is abandoned.</P>
      <P>While, for Ireland, the negotiations about trade and agricultural products and supports are of great importance, the WTO negotiations are also concerned with trade in industrial products, services and the developmental aspects. We cannot lose sight of that fact. When one considers that there are almost 150 countries in the WTO and the issues to be addressed are so expansive, covering economic, political, social and environmental issues, it is easy to appreciate the magnitude of the task in reaching agreement.</P>
      <P>From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the outcome of the talks as they relate to Ireland is vital from an agricultural point of view. As the dairy and beef sectors are the main elements of Irish agriculture, the impact of the proposals on the agri food sector could have major consequences for Ireland and could put the jobs of 112,000 farmers and 54,000 people employed in the agri food sector in jeopardy. The proposals being considered by the WTO in the lead up to Hong Kong would devastate Irish farm incomes. They would result in farm enterprises being operated at a loss. That is excluding decoupled payments. The result would be a fall in output which would impact seriously on rural areas and the national economy. The proposals, if agreed, would be irreversible and <Col N="846"/>would lead to an acceleration of rural decay through a decline in both population and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>However, a successful outcome to the talks is vital from a global perspective. While 1 billion people live on less than $1 per day, most of them farmers and farm workers, one can see that the system needs to be reformed. The sooner an agreement is reached, the better for everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in today&rsquo;s debate. I have been working closely with the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, as we prepare for the intensive and hugely important negotiations that lie ahead in Hong Kong. It is in that spirit of coherence that the Government is approaching the Hong Kong trade talks.</P>
      <P>Today, on World AIDS Day, we are reminded of the havoc the disease has wreaked on Africa, a continent already struggling to combat poverty on many fronts. The world&rsquo;s poorest countries &mdash; most of them in Africa &mdash; are not on target to reach the millennium development goals. To achieve the millennium development goals on target, the UN Secretary General has said that we must break with the &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; approach and dramatically accelerate and scale up action between now and 2015.</P>
      <P>In May, EU member states agreed that collectively they would reach the UN target for development assistance by 2015. In September, in New York, the Taoiseach and I, on behalf of Ireland, announced that we would reach the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product by 2012. That is three years ahead of the European Union and UN targets. The decision by the EU to set a 2010 interim target and 2015 final target will bring an extra &euro;20 billion into development worldwide. There has also been welcome progress in the momentous year of 2005 on the debt issue at the G8 summit in Gleneagles. Now, as the Hong Kong meeting approaches, we have a chance to make trade work for development. The UN has estimated that trade has the potential to lift developing countries out of poverty on a scale that could generate many times the benefits derived from aid alone. The figure is available internationally that for every pound, euro or dollar of aid, a trade concession is valued at seven times more.</P>
      <P>Trade is the exit strategy from aid dependence for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa which we seek to serve through our aid programme. The Irish aid programme has been well evaluated because of this. Some 80% of what is spent in the bilateral programme is expended on the least developed countries, with 50% of the overall programme being spent on them. The Doha development agenda is intended to be a development round. It is meant to create the conditions <Col N="847"/>whereby poor countries can take advantage of globalisation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Canc&uacute;n failed in large part because it did not meaningfully address the concerns of the poorest countries. A failure in Hong Kong risks the complete breakdown of the round, which would not be in anybody&rsquo;s interest, least of the lesser developed countries. It should be clear that my priority in the trade talks, as it is in the aid programme, is to assist the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. All developing countries are not the same. Brazil and India do not have the same needs as Ethiopia or Zambia. The least developed countries do not have the same capacity to compete on world markets as the more advanced developing countries and so they require special treatment.</P>
      <P>The European Union is used to being accused of demanding greater openness for trade in industrial products and services while at the same time protecting the agriculture sector to an extent that distorts world markets and makes it impossible for producers in developing countries to make a living. The issue is far more complex, and the truth is that the more advanced developing countries are much better placed than the poorer ones to take advantage of European Union agricultural trade concessions. The poorest developing countries benefit from preferential access to the European Union market. The reduction of these preferences will negatively impact on the economies of the least developed countries and set back their poverty eradication efforts.</P>
      <P>What does Ireland want for developing countries at the Hong Kong meeting? We wish to see concrete results in a number of areas. We want other rich nations to agree to eliminate duties and quotas on all products from least developed countries, with immediate effect. The EU has done this since 2001 under its everything but arms initiative, with some temporary exceptions. More work needs to be done on this initiative to make it a more effective tool for poverty reduction, but it is an important starting point, with the European Union leading from the front.</P>
      <P>We are looking for real progress on special and differential treatment for least developed countries. This means the poorest countries should be allowed to take on WTO rules at their own pace. They should not be obliged to take on any new commitments under this round. According to Pascal Lamy, this should be a round for free for least developed countries. Another key element of the development package which should emerge at Hong Kong is a positive outcome on TRIPS and public health. Ireland strongly supports the right of developing countries to access affordable medicines to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other infectious diseases that are robbing the human capacity of Africa to bring itself from poverty.</P>
      <P>We are determined to strike a deal for African cotton producers at Hong Kong. West African cotton producers are among the most efficient in <Col N="848"/>the world but their economies have been adversely affected by depressed world market prices caused largely by trade barriers and subsidies. In Geneva in July 2004, we agreed that the cotton situation would be dealt with ambitiously, expeditiously and specifically. The European Union has put forward proposals for action on cotton in all three pillars of the agricultural negotiations: market access, domestic support and export competition. Under the proposals we are offering to improve market access and reduce or remove subsidies either from day one of implementation of a Doha agreement, or very shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>The proposals have been well received and it remains to be seen whether other developed countries will follow suit and follow our lead at a European level. The European Commission will bring a &euro;1 billion package on aid for trade to Hong Kong. The package was announced by the Commission President, Mr. Barroso, at Gleneagles and is intended to help least developed countries to operate in an increasingly complex international trading environment. The Hong Kong package will include both trade related capacity building and measures to compensate for the negative effects of trade reforms.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I recently had the privilege and honour as Minister of State representing Ireland to support an EU Presidency initiative whereby member states would collectively match the &euro;1 billion package pledged by President Barroso with a package tabled as bilateral donors. We will then be giving assistance of the order of &euro;2 billion through the Commission and member state levels to improve the capacity of these countries to trade in our developed world markets. I will work towards a significant increase in Ireland&rsquo;s aid for trade spending within the context of our own aid programme so developing countries will have the capacity both to gain from measures within the Doha Round and to withstand the short-term losses that are inevitably involved in a multilateral liberalisation of trade.</P>
      <P>Aid for trade should be complementary to, rather than an alternative to, progress on the issues of real concern to the least developed countries. In that regard, it is my pleasure to announce here that next year Ireland will increase its contribution to &euro;500,000 to the global trust fund for the Doha development agenda as part of our commitment to increase aid for trade. Progress is being made to enhance the integrated framework for trade related technical assistance for least developed countries. The enhanced integrated framework will have greater resources and wider scope, and Ireland is committed to predictable funding at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about the millennium development goals, we must take action in Hong Kong. We must try to ensure that developing countries get a fair deal this time around. I warn those who are overly ambitious or idealistic. I state this with respect to members of the Oppo<Col N="849"/>sition who believe that seismic change can be achieved through these multilateral institutions. This is the first time development has been an explicit focus in the efforts of the international community, particularly in a trade context. I attended a summit at the UN in New York in September with the Taoiseach, where we announced the ambitious targets set for 2012. As we take in that summit and the Gleneagles package, it is fair to state that idealistic campaigners and people such as Bob Geldof and Bono had more ambitious aspirations for these events and this next round than reality dictates.</P>
      <P>I state this as a word of warning, as these multilateral processes are very difficult and complicated. It is hard to achieve great breakthroughs. Nevertheless I am honoured and privileged to be a Minister of State with responsibility for development in 2005 as a breakthrough has been achieved for the medium and long term. The development agenda is on the table and will continue to be for the years ahead. Europe has set a pace and set targets. Last March in Paris, Europe made a strong declaration on aid effectiveness. It also took the lead on setting the 2010 and 2015 interim and final targets for the achievement of the 0.7% of gross domestic product goal. I was proud to attend those meetings where we led the charge in insisting on setting the targets.</P>
      <P>The 2010 interim target will bring an extra &euro;20 billion into the development funding for aid. We must now move on the trade issue, as it is important. We should not be too distracted by an idea that seismic changes can be achieved in just one round or negotiation. When a person expressed disappointment to me after the September summit in New York, I contended that it was the UN rather than IBM. Sometimes the multilateral institutions do not move at the pace at which the public is prepared to move. I applaud the public for the campaigns mounted this year and I urge it to continue so the institutions might move more quickly to the benefit of developing countries which may have conditions of abject poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. On Tuesday the Central Statistics Office published statistics revealing that farm incomes have fallen by approximately 10% owing to a cut in margins of 4.2% this year. To compound this there is a very real and significant threat to EU agriculture in the upcoming WTO talks. The European Commission has made too many concessions too quickly. The revised Commission offer put forward at the end of last month now proposes the complete phasing out of exports refunds and a reduction of tariffs on food imports by between 30% and 60%. Specifically, the Commission has tabled a 50% cut in imports of milk products and a 60% cut in the imports of beef products. These proposals are outside the mandate given to the Commission by the Council of Ministers, which was that the Commission <Col N="850"/>would go no further than the mid-term review of CAP. The proposals are also contrary to the Treaty of Rome, Article 39 of which states that one of the objectives of CAP shall be &ldquo;to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture&rdquo;. There is now a serious danger that the current offer to the WTO will destroy the EU Internal Market for food, wiping out Irish agriculture and decimating farmers&rsquo; livelihoods and the rural economy.</P>
      <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are not the deal that Irish farmers signed up to when agreeing to the mid-term review of CAP and the introduction of the single farm payment. In October 2003, the then Minister, Deputy Walsh, stated: &ldquo;We now have a reformed CAP which protects payments to Irish farmers and is based clearly on the principles of market orientation, sustainability and environmental awareness.&rdquo; However, payments are not secured and are under threat from the UK. The WTO is giving no recognition for sustainability or environmental protection. In addition, on the issue of markets, our sugar industry is about to be mothballed, pig and poultry producers will be closed down by the inflexibility of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture and Food in the nitrates directive and our beef and dairy sectors will be decimated by the current WTO proposals.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The UK&rsquo;s demand for budgetary concessions on CAP is clouding Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s judgment and forming a bias in his negotiating ability. The reality is that the level of spending on agriculture in the overall EU budget has fallen by one third in the past 20 years whereas Britain&rsquo;s level of rebate, valued at almost &euro;5 billion annually, has not. It is imperative that Ireland ensures that the proposal on trade tariffs and income supports for farmers is taken off the table and that the EU negotiating position returns to the view that we have already reformed our agriculture supports and these will remain in place until 2013. I have previously called on the Taoiseach to take ownership of this process and to visit each of the leaders of the other member states to rally support for the retention of CAP reforms. I ask him as a matter of urgency to send the strongest possible message to the Commission noting the deep concerns and reservations of the Government and demanding that the Commission immediately withdraw its proposals to the WTO.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the current proposals. In return for the proposed EU cuts the United States has submitted a letter of intent on its planned cuts in its supports for agriculture which would be introduced in the 2007 Farm Bill. In reality the US proposal is worthless as it is based on legislation that has not and will not be approved by the US Congress, which will not accept any proposed cuts in US farm subsidies on the eve of an election in the United States. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, must immediately <Col N="851"/>call for an emergency meeting of the Council of Ministers prior to the opening of the WTO talks. Such a meeting would provide EU Agriculture Ministers with an opportunity to draw a line in the sand, caution the Commission on using agriculture as a bargaining chip, and call on it to revoke its offer in the absence of firm and tangible proposals from the US.</P>
      <P>EU farmers cannot compete on an equal footing against foreign imports because EU production standards add significantly to the cost of production, which must be taken into account in the case of any agreement. In addition, substantial regulation and red tape attach to Irish agriculture, for example, the impending nitrates directive, while similar stringent standards do not apply in the case of countries importing into the European Union. For example, the cattle tagging and traceability scheme in Brazil has been abandoned for the past 13 months, which highlights the fact that there is a very regulated system for Irish farmers producing beef but a very lax regime for Brazilian farmers producing beef for the same market.</P>
      <P>The demand of the WTO for trade liberalisation is diverting us from the vital issue of the production of quality, safe, healthy food for the EU consumer. Food is now an increasingly international commodity and poor standards in one region of the world can have significant food safety implications in another. A real consequence of the removal of trade barriers is the greater frequency of food scares. A key question for the Commission, therefore, is how much we value the need to have a European domestic food supply with assured quality and safety. If the CAP were wiped out, as Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s mentor, Mr. Blair, wants, we would run the risk of having food production at the mercy of factory farms, hypermarkets and dodgy imports which cannot be safely scrutinised.</P>
      <P>An important point is that the EU takes 85% of all agricultural produce exported from Africa. The knock-on effect of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals on Third World farmers will be the elimination of a high value market where they can obtain a premium price which can then be used to develop their food sectors. While many plead the development agenda as a justification for major cuts in CAP, there can be no doubt that cuts in tariffs will wipe out the special preferential access enjoyed by the world&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable countries. The developing world needs market access and the benefits of high EU prices but these can only be maintained by market management, not by unlimited access to EU markets, a move which would destabilise agriculture and food markets for all farmers. The real question of how to bring benefits to third world producers must include an analysis of who controls world commodity markets. We need a system which ensures that producers, whether EU or non-EU, <Col N="852"/>get a fair proportion of the final price paid by consumers for food.</P>
      <P>This is evident even in countries set to benefit most from the elimination of trade barriers, such as Brazil, where the smaller family farms will suffer continued poverty. Full liberalisation of trade would see Brazil&rsquo;s income rise by more than &euro;3.6 billion a year, yet 60% of its rural population would still have an income below the absolute poverty line. It is important to note that in these negotiations the poorest countries of the world are as opposed to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals as farmers within the EU. This is because the poorest countries know that if the proposals go through unchanged, they will lose the preferential access to premium EU markets they enjoy and the return on product they receive from EU markets will be substantially reduced. This will lead to a curtailment of the development of the food industry in these countries.</P>
      <P>It is also important to note which countries benefit from the proposals, namely, Brazil, Argentina, New Zealand and Australia. These countries will have unbridled market access throughout the world and they will wipe out many of the developing economies in Africa which are trying to develop their agriculture and food sectors. This has not been acknowledged in the debate to date. While the United States has been pushing the agenda in regard to the abolition of CAP, it will not allow access to its market for products produced in African countries which would help to develop their economies.</P>
      <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposals in their current form must be withdrawn. To allow them to be used as a negotiating tool is to destroy the agricultural economy of this country, condemning the countryside to desolation as well as destroying the potential of African countries to develop their food industries and putting the health of future generations in this country at increased risk from sub-standard cheap imported foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>I wish the Ministers involved the best of luck with the negotiations, for which they have the support of Fine Gael. I hope there will be a fair deal for Irish and African farmers.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As we have heard today, the negotiations on the next WTO agreement have entered an intensive phase in the run-up to the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong which begins on 13 December. Although it appears there may be a need to hold a further ministerial conference in the first half of 2006 to finalise all the details of a new agreement, there is no doubt that the negotiations which begin in Hong Kong in less than two weeks will be a significant step <Col N="853"/>on the road to a final agreement. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will attend these negotiations and will actively pursue the most beneficial outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.</P>
      <P>From our point of view, given the economic and social importance of our agriculture and food sector, this is a vitally important aspect of the negotiations. The outcome of the next WTO agreement will determine the levels of future protection and support for the agriculture sector and the new round could, therefore, have serious implications for the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>The negotiations were launched at the WTO Doha ministerial conference in November 2001. In so far as agriculture is concerned, the Doha mandate provides for substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support, reductions with a view to phasing out all forms of export subsidy and substantial improvements in market access.</P>
      <P>As part of the 2003 CAP reforms the EU made a deliberate decision to prepare in a forward-looking and positive manner for the challenges which Doha set for agriculture, such as the move to decouple payments. Decoupled payments, which by their nature are not linked to production, are considered non-trade distorting by the WTO. The EU move away from coupled and market support type payments has substantially reduced our levels of trade-distorting supports, thereby fulfilling one of the key objectives of the Doha declaration.</P>
      <P>The EU has also made a significant contribution in the area of export subsidies. The EU&rsquo;s commitment to eliminate export refunds completely facilitated the agreement in August 2004 on the WTO framework document providing the basis for a final agreement.</P>
      <P>This commitment was made on the basis that the other developed countries would agree to eliminate the trade distorting export subsidies which they apply through export credit regimes, state trading enterprises and food aid practices that involve the dumping of production surpluses on the markets of the poorest countries in the world. It is disappointing that the parallel elimination of export subsidies by other developed countries provided for in the August 2004 framework agreement has not been adequately addressed in the negotiations to date.</P>
      <P>These commitments by the EU have been proposed in advance of the final agreement on the new WTO round and by taking this approach the EU has clearly shown its commitment to achieving an ambitious outcome. I am disappointed that the same level of commitment to reform has not been shown to date by many of the other developed countries in the WTO and the EU continues to be put under pressure in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>In this context the Minister has been concerned that in recent months the Commission has been adopting an unnecessarily concessionary approach to the negotiations. The Commission <Col N="854"/>negotiates on behalf of the member states on the basis of a mandate which was agreed in the Council of Ministers. The mandate is designed to defend the CAP as it has evolved under successive reforms, including Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review, both of which were agreed with a view to positioning the EU in the WTO negotiations. The mandate aims to protect the European model of agriculture as an economic sector and a basis for sustainable development based on the multifunctional nature of agriculture and the part it plays in the economy, the environment and society generally.</P>
      <P>Several of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues on the Council share her concern. On 14 October she supported a memorandum, prepared by the French Minister for Agriculture and submitted to Commissioner Fisher Boel, outlining the growing unease with the Commission&rsquo;s approach. The memorandum urged the Commissioner to defend vigorously the EU position on agriculture in accordance with the mandate as agreed by the Council. The French initiative was endorsed by 14 EU Ministers for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister also strongly supported France&rsquo;s call for an extraordinary meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which was held on 18 October. She, together with several ministerial colleagues, again expressed concern at the negotiating strategy and tactics being adopted by the Commission. This initiative by the Minister and her EU colleagues resulted in the Council concluding that the CAP reforms are the EU&rsquo;s most important contribution to the negotiations and constitute the limit of the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating mandate.</P>
      <P>Following a further round of negotiations with other key WTO negotiating partners, the Commission tabled an improved EU offer on 28 October. The Minister has several concerns about the latest offer. First, in regard to domestic support, we believe the Commission&rsquo;s offer has reached the limit of the EU&rsquo;s bargaining position on trade-distorting payments.</P>
      <P>Protection of the green box is a fundamental priority. We are extremely concerned that the Commission&rsquo;s latest statement about defending the EU&rsquo;s system of direct payments, which are in the so-called green box and which make such an important contribution to Irish farm incomes, is rather weak. These payments have been exempt from reduction commitments in the past and the Commission&rsquo;s latest statement about a review of these qualifying criteria for the green box remains a cause of great concern to us.</P>
      <P>The Minister regards the protection of the decoupled payments in the green box as a red line which must not be crossed. On export subsidies we feel the Commission has already gone as far as it possibly can at this stage and it is vital that the parallel elimination of other forms of export subsidy used by other negotiating partners is adequately addressed. A further critical concern is the position which has been adopted on market <Col N="855"/>access. Very high tariff cuts have been offered, especially in the higher tariffs, which the Minister believes have the potential to open EU markets to increased competition from lower priced imports. The Commission will seek to protect the internal market through a sensitive product mechanism but the details of this mechanism will be crucial if EU markets are to be protected adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak on how the WTO talks will affect Irish agriculture. The three main areas of concern are domestic support, export subsidies and market access. It is important that the CAP and the single payment under the decoupled system are safeguarded under the green box because direct payments make a major contribution to farm incomes in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Doha mandate provided for reductions with a view to phasing out all forms of export subsidies. It is important that the phasing out is carried out over the longest period possible in a manner that causes least damage to our interests. Ireland has substantial exports of milk and beef to third countries which will not be competitive without export refunds. In other words, if the export refunds are abolished it will not be possible for Ireland to export to countries outside the EU. We must have time to develop our markets in the EU to fill that gap.</P>
      <P>We must retain the maximum possible level of protection for market access through a combination of tariff cuts and other mechanisms, including designating certain products as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; and implementing a special safeguard clause to protect our major EU markets from increased competition from imports from some third countries.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers are subject to full traceability of their beef, lamb and milk, while beef imports from Brazil and other countries outside the European Union are not subject to the same costly restrictions. Reducing tariffs substantially would prevent Ireland producing beef and milk at a profitable level. The only countries that would benefit are Brazil, New Zealand and Australia which have large farms and huge herds of cattle, and can produce beef at a low cost. The tariff reduction will not help poor countries. We need to help these countries first by enabling them to feed themselves. These countries do not have enough food to export. I have every confidence that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State at her Department, Deputy Brendan Smith, will bring back a reasonable deal. Never was there a greater need for such a deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the preparations for the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong. While Kofi Annan is hoping for a significant change in how these matters are discussed, a significant change is inevitably not taking place in <Col N="856"/>the House&rsquo;s discussions. The House will always discuss development on a Thursday when most Members have returned home and through statements rather than a motion upon which we could vote. To some Members who have spoken on this issue for years, these circumstances are inevitably disappointing. It is a matter that should be discussed in a prime spot of the House&rsquo;s Business, either on a Tuesday or Wednesday.</P>
      <P>We have heard three presentations which, as one expects, dealt with industry, trade and commerce, development issues and agricultural issues, respectively. Am I confident, having listened to the three speeches, that we are going with one concentrated and integrated voice to the WTO talks in Hong Kong? I am afraid I am not. There is less evidence of an integrated approach in any suggestion that we might have adopted a development-led approach to the Hong Kong talks.</P>
      <P>The ten minutes allocated do not allow me to go into much detail on the circumstances surrounding the resumed talks in Hong Kong. However, if the concentration on agriculture continues in the preparatory talks, it is difficult to see how significant progress will be made on the non-agricultural areas, traded commodities and services and the process of the WTO talks. This leads one to believe that, having had conflict between the EU and the US positions on agriculture, Hong Kong will conclude with even less than the Cancun talks.</P>
      <P>In the Uruguay round, the preceding one from which the process is drawn, the poorest people in the world paid a heavy price. The main beneficiaries were countries with strong economies such as Japan, the EU and the US. After Uruguay, there was an agreement that never again would we rob the poor to facilitate the rich. It was significant that the Doha talks were announced as a development round. However, what evidence is there that it remains that?</P>
      <P>Is there anything in what we heard from the Government to suggest the world millennium development goals or the elimination of world poverty will be the starting point of the talks? Are the negotiations to be world poverty-proofed or tested against the eighth millennium goal which does not have a timescale and is not specific on a fair and just international traded system? There is no evidence that a changed trade atmosphere with the removal of every obstacle, even if it gave economic growth, leads to a democratic improvement in incomes spread across societies.</P>
      <P>I hope there is some conversion in our position between now and the talks in Hong Kong. I will outline the principles that will give us integration in our approach to the talks and the prospect of development aims being given first place. The history of the states from the northern hemisphere that will participate in the Hong Kong talks shows they all have had a Keynesian moment in economic development, such as in Europe during its post-Second World War recon<Col N="857"/>struction. This allowed the use of supplied money and the mechanisms of state intervention and government initiatives to make the economy tick and expand. The northern hemisphere states always insist the southern hemisphere countries must not be allowed a Keynesian moment in their economic development. This is markedly unjust.</P>
      <P>To demand reciprocity as a principle of trade talks from countries, significantly poorer than rich and developed countries is monstrous, immoral and indefensible. It is true that there is a crying need to address rural development and restructure Irish agriculture, re-integrating it into a proper rural development model. However, the debate creates a false collision between the adjustment needed in Irish rural society and in some of the poorest countries in the world. If rural survival is an issue in Ireland, what about those countries seeking to have certain commodities governed by way of exception which are important to food security, rural development and the basic right of an economy to take its first steps towards development? These arise with special products and special protective measures that need to be taken by economies at the early stages of development. How will this be fed into the debate?</P>
      <P>The WTO has not radically changed its processes in transparency, consultation or preparation for the talks. We face a WTO that seems to regard diversity of opinion and conditions that exist in countries in the south as some type of obstacle.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Ireland supports an ambitious approach in requesting service sector liberalisation across the full range of internationally traded services sectors, including construction and related engineering, financial services and professional business and distribution services, to name but a few.</P>
      <P FLI="0">He continued to suggest there was nothing in this aspiration which will endanger the right of countries in Africa and Asia to develop their own essential public services. Separate from the WTO, further conditions are imposed by the IMF and the World Bank on developing economies. It is outrageous for multinational corporations to suggest they have the right of monopoly on the supply of clean water, the right to purchase land, the right to provide private health care and the right to regard education as the next best thing in Africa. This is the true story for services in Africa and Asia. There is no point in dancing around this fact. We must accept the rights of these countries to be secure in food supply, to be able to protect commodities necessary for the development of an infant state economy and to be able to defend their own integrity in pursuit of the democratic supply of essential basic services.</P><Col N="858"/>
      <P>I will not take from the enthusiasm and commitment of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, when he speaks of the importance of Ireland assisting with &euro;1 million for the UNCTAD process to enable poorer countries to have the capacity to become involved in negotiation. However, I do not see any evidence of the three Ministers of State involved agreeing that the lead conditions in the talks will be development ones and that Ireland&rsquo;s position will be adjusted to these in the interest of the elimination world poverty. There has been a suggestion, even by some non-governmental organisations, to allow the new trade regime to fall out so that we can all feel ethical about the consequences. The crux is whether development issues are to be regarded simply as a residuum of a trade round or will they be regarded as the condition on which the trade talks will open? The evidence does not suggest the latter. However, we have some time yet to change the minds of the Government and the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The current round of World Trade Organisation trade negotiations was launched four years ago at Doha. At the time, Ministers named it a development round because they wanted to address the concerns of world&rsquo;s poorest countries. They believed and still believe that a successful conclusion to what has become known as the Doha development agenda would be one of the most effective ways to generate economic growth, create potential for development and raise living standards across the world. In this context, the forthcoming meeting in Hong Kong is a vital element in reaching these goals. It offers an opportunity to complete the talks and lay down specific guidelines in terms of market access, trade facilitation and increasing democracy within the World Trade Organisation. It is, therefore, an opportunity we cannot allow to end in failure.</P>
      <P>We must ask ourselves whether the development agenda is being delivered. If we are honest with ourselves it is clear that, unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case. Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for example, recently suggested to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that development objectives are not being met. To describe this comment as disappointing is an understatement. In a year when world leaders have heard calls from ordinary people to make poverty history it seems we are not living up to our own declared intentions. 2005 was set to be the year that could make a difference for the poorest people of the world, with the G8 summit in July, a UN General Assembly meeting in September and a WTO meeting in December. So far, little appears to have changed. If we are to be the generation which eradicates poverty, however, we must start to make serious progress at the Hong Kong meeting this month.</P><Col N="859"/>
      <P>It will be important at the Hong Kong meeting that development is not treated as separate from the main thrust of the talks or an issue which can be dealt with in a side room. There is no point in offering some concessions in one room while undermining them in another. We must make sure the promises made are promises kept in all parts of the talks, including agriculture and trade in industrial goods and services. More effort needs to be put into the negotiations by the richer nations to ensure we secure an outcome which delivers trade benefits for people around the world, in particular in poorer countries.</P>
      <P>At a fundamental level the mandate and mechanisms of the WTO must be revised to ensure the promotion of a trade regime which fosters poverty elimination. To ensure the outcomes of the round enable the poorest countries to gain from the world trading regime policy, governments must ensure trade policies do not exacerbate existing inequalities or impede the achievement of the millennium development goals or implementation of international agreements on human rights, gender equality and labour standards.</P>
      <P>The most fundamental objective of the development agenda is to further the integration of developing countries into the global trading system. However, many developing countries have understandable concerns that a multilateral trading system will have severe negative effects on their economies. We must take these concerns seriously and examine the problem from their point of view. For example, the European Union and United States are seeking significant market opening from developing countries for trade in industrial goods. The concern is that if such changes take place, poor countries will no longer be able to use tariff policy to generate employment and other important benefits for their economies. Furthermore, such moves would hinder the development of national industries which are capable of supplying domestic markets and engaging in export.</P>
      <P>Issues of concern to developing countries must be prioritised and dealt with on the basis of the &ldquo;less than full reciprocity&rdquo; principle. For example, special and differential treatment should be applied to implementation timeframes as it will ensure developing countries can determine that the rate of liberalisation is commensurate with their national development policies. We must set down measures which ensure developing countries can continue to receive development co-operation in the form of preferential market access from industrial countries. The G8 leaders in Scotland stated that developing countries should be able to choose their own economic policies. In Hong Kong, these countries should have the freedom to make such a choice.</P>
      <P>While it is important to highlight the coherence between trade and development in a wide development framework, this debate should not focus purely on trade and trade liberalisation. <Col N="860"/>The latter alone is not a panacea for development challenges, particularly in the case of least developed countries. On the contrary, the integration of least developed countries into the global economy will require not only trade liberalisation measures but also measures to fight HIV-AIDS, build trade capacity, attract foreign direct investment, promote agricultural and rural development, support the role of women, especially in agricultural production and, crucially, increase investment in new technologies.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that issues such as market access, tariffs and subsidies cannot be treated in isolation from deeper development issues such as governance, health, education and economic reform. We must realise that trade liberalisation does not automatically offer a solution to development challenges, particularly in the case of least developed countries which are not able to fully exploit existing trading opportunities because of their low level of overall development. To integrate these countries in the global economy we need to offer them more than an opening of our markets. Increased school enrolment rates, higher quality education, functioning health systems, good governance and sound economic management are basic requirements for their economic development and integration into the global economy.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to Ethiopia is relevant to this argument. In Ethiopia I have seen how Irish aid and assistance has pushed for the development of better, more democratic and accountable governance which, in turn, should allow for a better quality of life for the population and an increased ability to do business with the wider world. Beyond the basics, the least developed countries have considerable needs in trade capacity building, an issue certain to arise at the meeting in Hong Kong. These range from transport infrastructure, port facilities, modern customs facilities, export promotion, access to information and communications systems etc.</P>
      <P>While many developing countries would clearly benefit from improved infrastructure to facilitate trade, it is essential that requirements for trade facilitation should not place an undue burden on them. Large-scale technical assistance should be provided to help developing countries, particularly least developed countries, upgrade their trade facilities. WTO negotiations on trade facilitation must not require them to invest in costly modern customs equipment and information technology.</P>
      <P>At both the EU and WTO levels we must recognise that in view of the difficulties facing developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, their integration into the global economy will require an integrated policy not purely focused on trade liberalisation measures. Measures such as fighting HIV-AIDS, building trade capacity, attracting foreign direct investment, promoting agricultural and rural <Col N="861"/>development, supporting the role of women and increasing investment in new technologies related to agriculture must also be embraced.</P>
      <P>This shift in policy must start in Hong Kong. The World Bank president, Paul Wolfowitz, recently wrote: &ldquo;The Doha development round of trade talks will be judged by one simple test: does it enable people in poor countries to sell more of their goods overseas, creating more jobs and lifting their incomes?&rdquo; There is still time &mdash; just &mdash; to achieve this outcome and, in the process, secure future prosperity for all. The Government and EU representatives must go to Hong Kong determined to ensure we secure an outcome which does not undermine development but pushes forward the fight against poverty. We could then be proud of our contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Morgan. While I agree with Deputy Carey that trade liberalisation does not necessarily benefit developing countries, I do not agree that Paul Wolfowitz is the best person to cite on the issue of helping the poorest people on the planet. Mr. Wolfowitz is a paragon of the neoliberal philosophy which has resulted in an increasing gap between rich and poor. The best way to address the problems of the developing countries is to examine some of the solutions they have put forward.</P>
      <P>Aspects of recent World Trade Organisation agreements, particularly the agreement on agriculture, AoA, have had negative impacts on developing countries. The greatest negative effect of trade liberalisation in this area has taken the form of agricultural goods being dumped on developing countries by developed countries and other developing countries. Two measures proposed by developing countries within the AoA negotiations are special products &mdash; SP &mdash; designation and special safeguard mechanism, SSM. These are designed to protect developing countries by safeguarding their food security and rural development interests.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Special products should be exempt from tariff reductions and should not be subject to restricting conditions. Developing countries should have the right and flexibility to declare for themselves specific SPs with respect to their own food security, livelihood security and rural development objectives. The criteria for selection of SPs should include the contribution to trade; the contribution to agricultural production; the link to livelihood, for example, the number of citizens employed in making products predominantly produced by low-income, small-scale farmers; and the link to food security, for example, the contribution to citizens&rsquo; calorie intake.</P>
      <P>In the long term, we must change the development model in terms of the respective roles of developed and developing countries. The current system is simply not sustainable. When I attended the summit on sustainability, it seemed clear that <Col N="862"/>the elites in developing countries want to buy into the globalisation model. It is the wrong way to go, however. The global growth rate of 1.4% annually may continue for 20 years, by which time the supply of conventional oil will be gone. How then will developing countries export their produce? This has not been factored into the equation, perhaps not even by the NGOs which support developing nations.</P>
      <P>That is what my party tried to convey yesterday when we talked about global warming and climate change. I ask the Government to address this serious problem. India and China are growing by 10% annually. It is not sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The upcoming ministerial meeting in Hong Kong is of utmost importance to developing countries. The State must show leadership and be a voice for justice and fairness. Since this round of negotiations began four years ago, Europe and other industrialised countries have been rolling back on the commitment that this should be a development round. This is not acceptable. The WTO&rsquo;s ministerial conference in Cancun collapsed when developing countries banded together and rejected the blueprint proposed by the WTO secretariat which did nothing to redress the disadvantages faced by developing countries in world trade. It amounted to nothing more than increased benefits for northern producers and industrialised countries.</P>
      <P>The WTO, founded in 1995, replaced the general agreement on trade and tariffs. Its role and objective is to ensure no member state adopts any type of protectionism in order to accelerate the liberalisation of global trading and facilitate the strategies of the multinationals. These trade negotiations, which have been dominated by rich developed countries, have progressively reduced taxes and other protections which countries are allowed to place on imports. The WTO is supported in this objective by the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>However, these policies are not helping these countries to develop. Western industrialised states use tariffs, subsidies and active investment policies to create their wealth. Governments in developing countries are being pushed to open up their economies to import more services and reduce social spending, thus drastically cutting social budgets in areas such as health, education, housing and infrastructure, and ending subsidies on products and services of primary necessity. All this has drastic consequences for local populations as living conditions in these countries deteriorate.</P>
      <P>The upcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong is the last opportunity to restore the Doha development round and put genuine development back on track. It is pointless to speak of development aid if we are not prepared to allow these countries to use trade policies to support their vulnerable farmers and local industries and to allow countries to choose the best <Col N="863"/>policies to address the social and economic needs of their population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important debate on the WTO negotiations. I wish to focus on the area of labour, workers&rsquo; rights and the crime of poverty internationally. I do not say this lightly. Unemployment, low wages and poverty should no longer be tolerated in a world full of surplus resources and finances. The Irish Ferries dispute has involved in recent days an attempt to introduce slave labour. As an Independent Deputy, I stand by workers and their rights both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>When talking about work, I like to refer to &ldquo;decent&rdquo; work. Economic growth alone does not eradicate poverty. Trickle down theories have been proved wrong in this regard. In many developing countries, wealth from new and stronger growth is continuously concentrated among elites. Decent employment is the key mechanism by which wealth is redistributed. Men and women want a global system that enables people to work themselves out of poverty in freedom and dignity. The world desperately needs a rapid expansion in employment growth. According to official estimates, 186 million people are out of work. However, this figure does not include people who fall outside the official statistics framework. For example, the Australian bureau of statistics deems that a person who works for one hour per week is employed.</P>
      <P>Is every job a good job? Simply having a job does not guarantee a living income. In addition to unemployment, many of the world&rsquo;s workers are underemployed, sometimes working in a number of jobs and on a regular or casual basis with no job security. In Asia alone, 1 billion people work to earn less than $2 per day. They are called the working poor because despite having a job, they do not have enough to live on. Women comprise 60% of the world&rsquo;s working poor. They are often the most underemployed and casualised members of the workforce.</P>
      <P>As well as not earning enough to live on, workers often must work in unsafe conditions, are discriminated against and, in worst case scenarios, engaged in slavery or child labour. More than 2 million workers die every year of work related diseases and accidents. In China, there were 500,000 work related deaths in 2001. At least 12.3 million people worldwide are trapped in forced labour, 2.4 million of those through human trafficking. There are 250 million child labourers; this figure only includes children who are paid for their work as opposed to working alongside their parents and families as is often the case in the agriculture industry. It is workers in developing countries who bear the brunt of these cruel work practices as their poverty gives them little or no choice. Within this, women are often the most underemployed and exploited.</P><Col N="864"/>
      <P>I believe in trade justice. Everybody should have the right to feed their families, earn a decent living and protect their environment. However, more than 1 billion people live on less than $1 per day, most of them farmers and farm workers. No matter how hard they work, they earn less every year. Unfair trade rules are a major reason. Current world trade rules rob people in poorer countries of the opportunity to trade their way out of poverty.</P>
      <P>I conclude with the words of Nelson Mandela: &ldquo;Trade justice for the developing world and for this generation is a truly significant way for the developed countries to show their commitment to bring about an end to global poverty&rdquo;. I stand by the message of Mr. Mandela and urge world leaders and the international community to stand by the poor of the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods"><NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the WTO Doha Round trade negotiations. The Doha Round is primarily a development round with a special focus on the needs and interests of developing countries. This round should produce measurable improvements in access to international markets and trade opportunities for the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. I do not refer to improving the opportunities for large industrial farmers located in, for example, Brazil and Australia. When we make concessions on tariffs or market access, we should look to measures designed to allow small farmers in sub-Saharan Africa or Latin America, including those in Brazil, to get their goods into the international market and to obtain a fair price for them.</P>
      <P>The developed countries must jump together on this. The EU should not be expected to make concessions alone while the CAIRNS group or other large-scale producers reap the benefits of a deregulated global marketplace.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the talks should be balanced within and across all of the main elements of the Doha work programme and be based on a broad and ambitious agenda. Therefore, the privileges and benefits offered by, for example, the Cotonou Agreement to the poorest countries must be protected and the comparative advantages offered to them maintained.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Delivering developed products should be a priority. The poorest countries should not be asked in the Doha Round to open their markets or meet global tariff reduction targets. They need a breathing space to reform and develop their own economies and to make some headway integrating into the world economy. This is a profound task. The EU&rsquo;s approach is a complex balance of interests between the member states. The EU negotiating mandate agreed between the 25 member states favours continued liberalisation <Col N="865"/>of trade in industrial goods and services and uses the agreed Common Agricultural Policy reforms as the basis for the EU&rsquo;s input to the agriculture liberalisation negotiations. I agree with this approach.</P>
      <P>The EU&rsquo;s acceptance of the objective of abolition of agricultural export subsidies, coupled with its continued reform of CAP, most recently in 2003, was the major impetus towards relaunching the Doha round in July 2004. Without this breakthrough there would not have been a new round of talks in Hong Kong. Therefore, this concession from the EU&rsquo;s farmers cannot just be pocketed by other developed countries before the negotiations even begin. Other major participants, in particular the US and the Cairns group of agricultural exporting countries, such as Australia and Canada, must now fulfil their obligations and match what the EU is committed to doing in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Without special attention from governments, agriculture and, as a consequence, the rural environment would be changed utterly by the forces of international competition from industrial-scale producers intent only on maximising profits and that would dump the social and environmental costs on local economies and communities. No one wants to see this outcome. We want a balanced outcome. In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 85% of people depend on agriculture in one form or another.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been and will continue to be a clear beneficiary of international trade liberalisation. In the 1960s, 75% of our merchandise exports went to the United Kingdom. Today that figure is 18%. The Celtic tiger feeds on international trade. EU negotiators will seek market opening opportunities in tradeable goods and services as well as a balanced outcome on agriculture and a deal on fair trade for the world&rsquo;s poorest people. As such, we in Ireland have much to gain from ensuring that the WTO process continues and that clear rules are established to allow all countries and all populations within them to gain fair access to international markets with special supports for the weakest people.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is not the end of the road. It is certain that the negotiations will continue into 2006. A pro-development round, if properly resourced and implemented, could lift more people out of poverty, misery and deprivation than all the aid donations of the last 30 years. This is the great challenge of our times. It could transform the world in 15 years. I wish the Minister and Minister of State well in the negotiations next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue which is of grave importance to Ireland. The proposals being considered by the WTO in the lead-up to the Hong Kong meeting in December, including those of the EU&rsquo;s, would devastate Irish farmers&rsquo; incomes. Furthermore, they would result in all farm <Col N="866"/>enterprises, excluding the decoupled payments, operating at a loss. The result would be an unprecedented fall in output which would, in turn, impact severely on rural areas and the national economy. Once agreed, these proposals will be irreversible and will lead to an acceleration in rural decay through the decline of population and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Upon agreeing the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU&rsquo;s Agriculture and Fisheries Council stated that it constituted the basis for the EU offer to the WTO and that any WTO agreement must not involve a change in the mid-term review agreement which is to run until at least 2013. Under the EU treaty, the European Commission is delegated power to negotiate on behalf of all member states in strict legal accordance with a mandate from the Council of Ministers. It is quite evident that the offer made by Commissioner Peter Mandelson breaches the decision taken by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and is, therefore, outside the mandate given to the Commission.</P>
      <P>The WTO is about trade. Ireland is an open economy and highly dependent on trade. For example, it is more dependent on third country agricultural exports for animal products than any other member state. Ireland stands to lose the most from adverse changes in international trade rules. Even after the recent significant expansion of the Irish economy, the agrifood sector still constitutes an important element, being 9.4% of gross domestic product, 8.5% of employment and 8.4% of exports.</P>
      <P>The EU is the world&rsquo;s largest importer of agricultural goods, importing more than &euro;60 billion per annum. The EU is also the world&rsquo;s largest importer of farm products from developing countries. It imports from developing countries as much as the United States of America, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand combined. The EU absorbs approximately 85% of Africa&rsquo;s agricultural exports and 45% of Latin America&rsquo;s. The EU is a net importer of agricultural products and imported &euro;6.5 billion more of agricultural products than it exported in 2001. In contrast, the US is a net agricultural exporter. In the context of these already high levels of imports, there must not be any further opening up of EU markets. The EU must not be railroaded into giving away more of its domestic markets by the US, for example, which does not import a single kilogram of fresh meat from South America.</P>
      <P>The three elements of the WTO negotiations &mdash; export refunds, domestic support and market access &mdash; are all important. However, market access is of critical importance in respect of EU farm prices. Overall, 22% of Irish agrifood exports required an export refund in 2004. Export refunds paid on Irish exports in 2004 were worth &euro;215 million to the Irish economy and supported the export of &euro;455 million of Irish dairy products and &euro;66 million of beef products.</P><Col N="867"/>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Michael Ahern, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, the best of luck in these negotiations. Knowing both, they will not be found wanting in defending Irish interests.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Stanton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Hong Kong in December 2005 will be remembered for a long time to come. The potential consequences of what will happen will shape Irish and world trade for a very long time.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will dwell on how a bad outcome at the Hong Kong talks will impact on rural communities and Ireland&rsquo;s farming industry. It must be realised that the negotiations will be conducted among the heavyweight trading blocks of the world where Irish interests, for obvious reasons, will be negotiated under the EU flag. As everyone knows, world trade takes circuitous routes on agricultural matters. The US regime has a direct bearing on world food prices. On any analysis of the situation it appears the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fischer Boel, has not alone shown her hand before the final negotiations have even started but has more or less thrown in the towel to the Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson. It appears that whatever he wants is the tune the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development seems to be dancing to. I warn the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take care they do not take her off the dance floor altogether. The Minister will find herself in a serious situation.</P>
      <P>The farmers of Europe cannot understand the reason the EU CAP must change so often. I have not sufficient time to discuss this in detail but we all remember the guiding principles of the Treaty of Rome. The difference between then and now is like the difference between chalk and cheese. Under Agenda 2000 every farmer in the country believed they would be farming to that pattern for six years. The mid-term review in 2003 caused the biggest single change ever in European farming and Irish farmers bought into it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have no doubt the Minister put up as good an effort as she could but now it seems she was gunned out of it at European level. Deputy Johnny Brady will know this because he is involved with it every day of his life, but the contents of the green box which we thought were sacrosanct and which we were told would not be touched until 2013, will possibly be reviewed as a consequence of those talks in Hong Kong. Who can one believe? Who is there to represent us? I had many other points to make. The poorer <Col N="868"/>nations of the world should be given greater help with their debts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have seen this happen at a number of world trade talks that not alone will the Minister and her colleague not be in the front row at the negotiations in Hong Kong, they will not be in the second, third or fourth rows. This is not through any fault of her own. This is the reason Commissioner Fischer Boel and Peter Mandelson are the people who have to be watched. I am a farmer but I do not earn my living from it, but if I did I would be very worried about those two people working on my behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish my constituency colleague opposite all the best in his important work on behalf of the State. We will look after the shop while he is away. It is a very serious situation.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two points. I refer to developing countries as underdeveloped countries. They are the countries with no chance at all. Over thousands of years they have been robbed of their wealth, prosperity and people through slavery and they have never recovered. We must look after those underdeveloped countries. They are not even at the level of developing countries. Many Members have received representations from constituents and concerned people on this issue and I ask the Minister to ensure this happens.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have just come from a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. I was very perturbed at what I learned there. It appears the sugar industry is more or less finished and the committee was also told the pig industry is in difficulties because of the nitrates directive, which means that industry will also be gone. Other crops such as malting barley are in trouble. That crop is gone from the part of the country represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and myself. Agriculture is in trouble in Ireland. I said in Mallow two weeks ago that the Minister needs to get out there and we want to support her in her work at European level on behalf of Irish farmers and Irish agriculture. I know she is doing her best. The Opposition wants to support her in her work because it is really crucial.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will be attending a meeting of farmers in my area this evening. They are depressed, in trouble and worried. They ask what they can do, what they can grow and what the alternatives are, but there are none. Perhaps the Minister can tell the House what are the alternatives. The situation for Irish farmers seems to be bleak and very serious. They need answers and results. We all want to support the Minister in her work because it is of vital national importance that she succeeds.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The sugar beet industry seems to be gone and there is nothing to replace it. The production of biofuels has been discussed for years, almost as long as I have been in this House which is eight years, and still nothing has happened fast enough. The alternatives are not there for farmers. There <Col N="869"/>will be a flight from the land, with much of it left idle. Other colleagues have made the point that if an international crisis occurs, we could find ourselves hungry in this country. This is an island nation and we can see what is happening in Irish Ferries where a dispute causes a national problem. We are totally dependent on foreign imports. If we become dependent on food imports, we could find ourselves hungry for the first time in a long time if anything goes wrong. I wish the Minister the best of luck at the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members who have participated in this discussion on the World Trade Organisation. Although it appears that while the Hong Kong conference will not result in the final agreement being reached, it will play a vital role in making significant progress to that complete final agreement and for that reason, the outcome is crucial.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s priority is to see that the process of trade liberalisation continues in a fair and balanced manner and that the WTO continues to provide a stable and constant framework for the regulation of world trade. As a small open economy Ireland has much to gain from a successful outcome to this round of multilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>On agriculture I wish to make it clear that the EU&rsquo;s latest offer is as far as we can go. We have reformed domestic supports, committed to elimination of export subsidies and proposed substantial reductions in import tariffs. We have no more room for manoeuvre. It is simply not acceptable that the CAP would require further reform. We have prepared responsibly for these negotiations and have participated constructively at every opportunity. It is unacceptable that further concessions are demanded of the EU, especially on agriculture. I believe all Members are in agreement.</P>
      <P>On domestic support, I wish to ensure that the system of decoupled direct payments continues to qualify as non-trade distorting payments under the so called green box and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round. Deputy Connaughton is correct in his views and concerns on this matter. On export subsidies I want to achieve full parallel treatment of all forms of export subsidy and to ensure that the agreed phasing out is carried out over the longest possible period and in a manner least damaging to our interests. On market access, I want to retain the maximum possible level of protection through a combination of tariff cuts and other mechanisms including the designation of products of particular interest as sensitive products in order to protect our major EU markets from increased competition from imports from third countries. I have made my position clear to the Commission and I will not accept any further concessions on agriculture. Ireland is seeking an ambitious outcome from a development perspective. We will <Col N="870"/>be pursuing the following key objectives: special and differential treatment for developing countries in terms of lesser reduction commitments and longer implementation periods; full duty free and quota free access to developed country markets for all products from least developed countries &mdash; this is already provided by the EU through the Everything But Arms initiative; and a comprehensive aid for trade package including a broad financial envelope, which compensates for possible loss of preferences by least developed countries.</P>
      <P>An appropriate formula that will drive down tariffs on industrial goods is required. The use of this formula will help compress tariff ranges and get rid of high and escalating tariffs. Ireland has strong strategic commercial interests and ambitions in securing tariff reductions across a broad range of sectors, including in the areas of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, ICT and related electronic machinery sectors.</P>
      <P>In addition to tariff reduction, Ireland supports proposals to seek reductions in, or elimination of, non-tariff barriers which have the potential to limit trade. These include, for example, unfair licensing regimes, costly labelling requirements or complex certification techniques.</P>
      <P>The EU has a relatively open and liberal services market and would wish to see reciprocal markets opening from our main trading partners, including developed countries and the more advanced developing countries such as Brazil, India and China. Ireland and the EU are seeking better market access and a more transparent and predictable environment for European service suppliers in third country markets. Ireland supports an ambitious approach in requesting service sector liberalisation across the full range of internationally traded services sectors, including construction and related engineering, financial services and professional business and distribution services, to name but a few. To alleviate the concerns of Deputy Higgins, the EU, in the context of service negotiations, has not sought market opening in public services and services such as education, health and water provision.</P>
      <P>Improved WTO services disciplines might also benefit Irish consumers by increasing the level of competition in the provision of professional and other types of services in the domestic Irish market, without compromising other valid public policy objectives such as consumer protection, prudential regulation and universal provision.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that at present other negotiating partners are focusing on pursuing further concessions from the EU without any reciprocal movement by them. The EU cannot be blamed for the current difficulties in the negotiations. Other developed countries and the more economically advanced developing countries must now step up and deliver if an ambitious Doha round, which will benefit the poorest countries in the world, is to be achieved. As we approach the Hong Kong ministerial meeting, the onus is firmly <Col N="871"/>on other developed countries to show the same level of ambition as the European Union in all elements of the negotiations, including agriculture.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that a social welfare recipient&rsquo;s total weekly income is sufficient to meet all their basic living needs, including food and heating costs. In recent years significant budget resources have been concentrated on providing real increases over and above inflation in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. This approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating.</P>
        <P>Overall inflation, including food costs and fuel price increases, has amounted to 12.8% since January 2002. In the same period weekly social welfare rates incorporating fuel allowance have increased cumulatively by between 33% and<?oasys _jy?>37%. The household benefits allowances have also been increased fully in line with electricity and gas prices in the period and these are payable all year round to assist eligible pensioners, carers and disabled people with their heating costs.</P>
        <P>Fuel allowances are supplements payable over the winter months to people in receipt of pensions and other qualifying social welfare schemes. Some 274,000 people receive this allowance at a cost of &euro;85.4 million this year.</P>
        <P>Increases in basic payment rates or in the rate or duration of the fuel allowance have significant cost implications. For example, an increase in basic rates of &euro;1 per week would cost &euro;52 million per annum. Increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;1 per week would cost &euro;8 million per annum. Increasing the duration of the fuel allowance by one week would cost just under &euro;3 million per annum.</P><Col N="872"/>
        <P>There is a broader issue of energy inefficiency, particularly in older private dwellings. Problems with poor insulation or inefficient heating systems in some houses can lead to discomfort and health problems, as well as being more wasteful of fuel costs.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Obviously, I recognise that someone on a low income in a private dwelling has limited scope to spend money to correct structural energy inefficiencies in his or her house. As a start in addressing this issue, my Department is co-operating with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and local Government, Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Combat Poverty Agency in a pilot action research project in Cork and Donegal to improve heating systems and insulation in selected older private dwellings and to monitor the outcomes for the households in terms of improved cost-efficiency and comfort and health levels. This project is due to commence shortly and should be informative in formulating future policy on this issue, as well as being of more immediate direct benefit to the pilot households involved.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I am keeping the various social welfare programmes under close review to ensure that they assist towards heating needs as efficiently and effectively as possible within the budget resources available to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is he saying that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is mistaken and its view is wrong, that there is no hardship out there because of the increase in fuel costs, that everyone is all right, has plenty of heat and enough to eat, and that there is no problem? Is the Minister&rsquo;s response that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is totally incorrect and older people are fine? Will he admit that there is a problem and there is an issue where the recent increase in fuel costs, of oil and gas in particular, is causing hardship to older people and, if so, what will he do about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, what I am saying is that there obviously is an issue here. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does fantastic work on behalf of all of us. Its members are out and about meeting people and they know what they are talking about. I read carefully the society&rsquo;s pre-budget submission in which it made many strong points which, like all other submissions, will be taken into account in the budgetary context.</P>
        <P>I stated in my reply that food costs and fuel price increases had amounted to 12.8% since January 2002 but in the same period social welfare rates, including fuel allowance rates, increased cumulatively by between 33% and<?oasys _jy?>37%. While the fuel allowance has not increased, the overall increases have far surpassed the costs involved. In the context of the forthcoming <Col N="873"/>budget, the submission from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul will be taken fully into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am confused. Is the Minister stating on the one hand that there is a problem and on the other hand that there is not a problem? He either agrees with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that there is an issue out there that needs to be addressed or he is saying that the society&rsquo;s view is wrong? Will the Minister, in plain English, tell me which it is? Does he agree with the society and, if so, what will he do about it? Does he agree, for instance, that perhaps this process of increases only once a year does not take into account what can happens in between? Has he any evidence of hardship through sources other than the Society of St. Vincent de Paul?</P>
        <P>I will repeat the question again to keep it simple for the Minister. Does he agree with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that there is a problem and, if so, will he say so and say what he will do about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course there is a problem, otherwise there would not be a Department like mine. There obviously is a problem and we are trying to address it in many ways.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that more than 600,000 Irish persons will be struggling to make ends meet and <Col N="874"/>that thousands will fall into the clutches of moneylenders in Christmas 2005; the steps he intends to take to address the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[37391/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the concerns expressed recently by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in its pre-budget submission. In view of the particular financial pressures experienced at this time of the year by persons and families in receipt of social welfare payments, I recently announced that a Christmas double payment will be made to more than 1.2 million welfare customers and their dependants. The payment, to be made this month, is a sign of commitment to social welfare recipients. It will be equivalent to 100% of the normal weekly payment and will cost almost &euro;140 million.</P>
        <P>My Department has a number of services available to assist individuals and families, primarily those on low income, to manage their finances and to open up affordable credit options. The money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which was originally established in 1992 on a pilot basis as an approach to combating the problem of illegal moneylending, operates nationwide through 52 local companies with the support of funding of &euro;14 million from the Department. The service is designed to target families and individuals identified as having problems with debt and moneylending. Strong emphasis is placed on practical budget-based measures that will succeed in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of low cost credit through the credit union movement. MABS management committees are drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups and often include credit union representatives.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that where severe hardship exists in cases of over-indebtedness, MABS customers receive the most appropriate assistance to deal with the situation. The 2005 budget allocation included a sum of &euro;700,000 to establish a MABS helpline. Furthermore, one of the MABS companies is operating a pilot scheme together with a local credit union to help those who are borrowing from moneylenders, to access credit at a low interest rate.</P>
        <P>Through its operation of the household budget scheme with An Post, the Department assists people who receive certain social welfare payments with money management by enabling them to pay a regular amount towards various household bills by direct deduction from their payments. This scheme is used mainly to cover local authority rents and mortgages and utilities.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>There is also provision under the supplementary allowance scheme through its exceptional needs payments, whereby persons may qualify for once-off payments from the Health Service <Col N="875"/>Executive to help prevent undue hardship at times of exceptional expenditure.</P>
        <P>Building a fair and inclusive society and helping the most vulnerable have been, and continue to be, key priorities of the Government. The Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to tackling poverty is set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. The Office for Social Inclusion, OSI, is preparing the third national action plan to cover the period 2006-08. This involves consultation with all relevant stakeholders, those who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion and those who work to support them, either directly or indirectly.</P>
        <P>In my area of social welfare, spending has more than doubled, from &euro;5.7 billion in 1997 to &euro;12.25 billion in 2005, providing significant real increases in payments during this period. As a result, in the period 2001 to 2005 the lowest social welfare rates increased by 40% while the consumer price index increased by just over 13%. Child benefit rates increased by 65% over the same period, while from 2002 to 2005 pensioners received increases of &euro;44.71 per week.</P>
        <P>In drawing attention to these increases, I am not complacent about the current situation. Much more remains to be done to tackle the problems of poverty and exclusion, including those highlighted by the society. I am determined, therefore, through vigorous implementation and development of the strategic process, in full consultation with all the stakeholders at national, regional and local levels, to continue to build and improve on our achievements so far. I am also examining specific targeted measures that could be implemented to address areas of particular concern, including child poverty and pensioner poverty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not astonishing that despite the unprecedented level of economic resources available, when we have the opportunity to ensure that people are lifted out of poverty, that various reports reflect the fact we have failed to do so? We should accept that poverty is not inevitable and that if the political, economic and social structures were put in place, it could be arrested and reversed. Is it not disgraceful that in the most affluent economic climate and circumstances ever, more than 600,000 Irish people will struggle this month to make ends meet and that thousands more will fall into the clutches of moneylenders? That is a frightening statistic.</P>
        <P>We see charges of up to 200%, even with the licensed moneylenders. With unlicensed moneylenders it is a case of whatever they can extract. Will the Minister now consider restoring the money, advice and budgeting service, MABS, supplement that was one of the savage 16 cuts unnecessarily and shamefully inflicted by his predecessor on the very vulnerable people who will now feel the heat? Will he agree that it is important to send out a clear message for people <Col N="876"/>to keep away from moneylenders and warn that many people with no money to spend who feel pressurised to approach them should try to get some help through different sources?</P>
        <P>In that context, why have the calls to just one organisation, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, exceeded 300,000 in the current year, an increase of more than 10%? That is not a submission. It is empirical statistical data reflecting dire consequences for this country. Despite our successful economy we have a fractured society. Is that the legacy this Government will leave behind at the end of May 2007, if it lasts that long?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On MABS, last year&rsquo;s budget gave a special allocation of &euro;700,000, which was exactly the same amount that been removed earlier in one of the cuts referred to by the Deputy. I restored that funding but left it to the discretion of the MABS management as to where it fitted best. One must realise that since 1996, taxpayer spending on this area has doubled. It has moved from &euro;5.7 billion up to &euro;12.2 billion in just a few of years. Child benefit, for example, has increased by 65% over the same period. Therefore, there have been substantial increases with taxpayer funding going into it.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has probably heard me say a thousand times that a third of all Government spending is accounted for by this area. That is not to say that I am complacent, however. I take the point made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Deputies opposite. There are real social issues in society still to be dealt with and people are still struggling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not see that figure of 300,000 in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul submission unless somebody can point it out to me. It is a figure that I saw in the newspapers, but I do not see it in the report and it is not in the chairman's foreword. I would not like that figure to take hold before we can confirm the statistics in this area. Deputies have also heard me talk many times, and there is some degree of agreement in the House on this, about the frustration caused by different poverty measurements. We have made massive strides but we cannot afford to be complacent. That is why the increases will continue.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if he will consider extending the Christmas bonus to all those in receipt of short-term disability in excess of six months; and if he will give a costing for this.</Quest>
        <QRef>[37483/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Christmas bonus payment was first introduced in December 1980 for social welfare pensioners and people who depend solely on their social welfare payments for income support. There have been a number of developments in this initiative since its inception, including changes in the level of the bonus payment which has been at the rate of 100% over the past six years, the introduction of a minimum payment <Col N="877"/>and the extension of the categories of eligible claimants.</P>
        <P>The focus of the bonus has always been on assisting people who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the longer term. These include recipients of retirement, old age &mdash; contributory and non-contributory &mdash; widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s and invalidity pensions, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, long-term unemployment assistance, farm assist and people on employment support payments, for example, the back to work allowance.</P>
        <P>The bonus is also payable to certain participants on F&Aacute;S, vocational training opportunities, job incentive and community employment schemes and to those in receipt of payment under the rural social scheme which was introduced in 2004 and operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Christmas bonus payment will benefit more than 1.22 million people this year, comprising some 835,000 social welfare recipients and their 384,000 dependants. Payment of the bonus is estimated to cost almost &euro;140 million in 2005 and payment is being made to recipients of the relevant long-term schemes this week. Of the 64,000 persons in receipt of disability or injury benefit, almost 42,400 obtain those payments for six months or longer. It is estimated that extending the bonus to those people would cost in the region of &euro;6.75 million.</P>
        <P>The extension of the bonus to any one category of short-term payment would inevitably lead to pressure to extend it to all other short-term payment schemes. Consequently, the implications of any amendment to the Christmas bonus must be considered in the context of competing demands for available resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Minister is saying in his reply that he will not consider paying it to people in receipt of disability benefit for more than six months. The question was about whether the Minister would consider making the payment. It is a short-term measure but some of the people who avail of this benefit could be on it for up to two years or longer. It is called short-term but it is not really that. My suggestion in the question was about anyone on it for more than six months. That is a long time for a single person to survive on benefit of &euro;140.80 a week with possibly an extra &euro;100 for a married person or spouse. There is difficulty involved, especially at Christmas time. I understand it is a matter of finances but perhaps the Minister should examine this issue, even if it is too late for this year. The way the system rolls out at the moment is unfair. To be on that benefit for six months is a long time. We all know poverty is incremental and so on and the hardship involved.</P>
        <P>I presume when this scheme was originally implemented it was on the basis that the Depart<Col N="878"/>ment did not want people going on sick benefit prior to Christmas or whatever. However, if someone is on it for six months, he or she is genuinely sick. The Minister will appreciate that if someone is sick for that length of time, all types of extra costs are involved. That was the reason for the question. I suppose it is the difference between being Santa or Scrooge coming up to Christmas. An opportunity exists and it should be put right. I do not know whether this may be done in the light of the Minister&rsquo;s current budget proposals, but if he cannot do something this year, perhaps he could consider it for next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I said, some 834,000 people already get the bonus. The distinction was made many years ago between long-term and short-term recipients. It was decided that long-term people would get the bonus and short-term people would not. The Deputy is quite right in that disability benefit is a short-term scheme. However, there can be an anomaly in that many people can be on a short-term scheme for a long time. I take that point. The proposal the Deputy has in mind is six months, equivalent to 42,400 people, which would cost &euro;6.75 million. If one could ring-fence that, I would be interested in looking at it. One must be careful in pulling the thread of short-term schemes, however, because it could open them to another 200,000 people if all were to be included. That would involve a bill for &euro;31 million for which there is no particular demand at present. I acknowledge that it is a short-term scheme and some people can be on it for a year or two. They have the option of moving to an invalidity pension after one year. If they receive that pension, they will get the bonus. The option exists but they must pass a medical test to avail of it. Many people who are on benefit for 12 months transfer to the invalidity pension and they then get the bonus. There is an issue there which I will continue to study.</P>

	<P>My Department has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the fruits of our economic growth benefit all, particularly those who are most vulnerable and in need of vital support. I am determined that the resources available to my Department will be targeted at delivering 21st century welfare supports which are characterised by recognition, compassion, activation and service throughout the range of allowances and benefits. I am actively pursuing a new social reform agenda that has at its core the ambition of reaching behind the welfare payments and addressing the social issues involved. My social <Col N="879"/>policy reform agenda includes addressing issues such as child poverty, pensions, lone parents, job seekers and carers.</P>
        <P>Child poverty is clearly a complex area requiring coordinated action across a range of services and income support payments. The development of income supports which can make the most effective contribution to alleviating child poverty lies within my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities and a series of budgets have increased considerably in real terms. The National Economic and Social Council has, during 2005, spent considerable time and effort in analysing this area.</P>
        <P>The Government has made a number of commitments on pensions and significant progress has already been made. Overall pensions have increased by up to 81% since 1997 against a CPI increase of just under 31% in the same period. Significant increases in qualified adult allowances have also been given in recent years. I am examining the operation of our pension schemes with particular reference to the means test associated with the old age non-contributory pension. My aim is to provide choices to people in how they spend their later years and to ensure that the rules of our welfare schemes do not impinge on the choices people might want to make. I recently received the national pensions review on occupational pensions from the pensions board. This is before the Government and we will publish it shortly.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring forward proposals to support and encourage thousands of lone parents in achieving a better standard of living. We are committed to ensuring that the long term unemployed and other welfare recipients have the opportunities they need to return to work. Supporting carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. The improvements we have made across the board provide the Government with a strong social policy reform agenda.</P>

What plans does he have to bring in the two tier payment about which he has been talking for some time? What plans does he have to change the cohabitation rules so that single parents are not caught in a trap? He has many announcements on this issue as well. What are his plans for child care? What changes will he make in the qualified adult allowance? If he cannot give a response here, will he consider setting out targets and timetables for these issues in the next few weeks? We have seen many pictures of the Minister on the front pages of the Sunday newspapers, outlining his thoughts for the week, but <Col N="880"/>we have yet to see concrete targeted proposals that are costed and clear.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The last budget began these reforms. We brought in special allowances for carers to recognise their work. We made substantial improvements in child benefit which started the reform process on child poverty. We moved income disregards for pensioners so that they could have much more income before they kicked into a pension. I refute the suggestion that the social agenda I have been laying out has not been pursued. It began in last year&rsquo;s budget and continued in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 and in my preparations for next week&rsquo;s budget. I have been guided by these social reform measures.</P>
        <P>The NESC provided me with a report on the two tier payment and I am having discussions with colleagues on the progress we can make in up-coming legislation and in up-coming budgets. I have brought a paper on the cohabitation rule to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and I have got broad agreement to make the amendment. I will go back to the Cabinet soon on that issue. I am very keen to replace it with a family friendly allowance. I have been too long in politics to give the Deputy deadlines by which I will have reformed Ireland&rsquo;s social problems. They will be around long after I leave office. What I can do is to lay out clearly my priorities. These include child poverty, pensions, the liberation of lone parents and elderly people on pensions who want to do other things, as well as recognising our carers. In our budgets and Social Welfare Bills, I want to make sure that we give effect to those policy objectives. That is an on-going process and will not be completed in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.</P>

        <Quest>if he has identified policies, specifically social welfare payments payable under the mandate of his Department, that act as a disincentive for non-marital and marital families to live together; if having identified such disincentives, he has proposals to alter the parameters under which such payments are made and under which such policies are constructed; <Col N="881"/>and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Entitlement to certain social welfare payments aimed at supporting those parenting alone is contingent on the claimant not cohabiting in a spousal relationship with another adult. I am aware that reluctance on the part of some parents to forego the income security provided by schemes such as the one parent family payment may act as a disincentive to the formation of partnerships and ultimately marriage for recipients. One of the qualifying conditions for the one parent family payment states that a parent must be the main carer of the child and the scheme, as it currently operates, may not sufficiently facilitate joint parenting for couples who are separating. This is why I established a working group in my Department earlier this year to review the income support arrangements for lone parents and to address issues such as the contingency basis of certain payments. A process of consultation with social partners was also conducted as part of this review and the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion has been updated on progress.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to bring this report to the Cabinet shortly, along with another report conducted by a sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion, which was mandated to look at the obstacles to employment faced by lone parents. Both reports will then be published and a further period of consultation will lead to the development of proposals designed to support and encourage all parents in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, a better future for themselves and their children and a more appropriate social policy in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>One aspect not highlighted by the Minister in his response was the community welfare payment for housing supports. That is a significant disincentive to people. Every Deputy in this House knows people who are either living apart or stating that they are living apart, as they would lose the rent assistance when one person works. I am aware that the system is changing towards a rent assistance scheme. Will the Minister consider looking at an interim arrangement? It will take four years for the rent assistance scheme to come into effect.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I always thought Ireland was regarded as a family friendly country. I know of families who live apart. I presume that other Members are aware of similar examples caused by a family&rsquo;s financial situation. I am sure the Minister is aware that some people feel they spend their lives looking over their shoulders and that the system has made them dishonest. While I do not condone it when people work and claim for benefits to which they are not entitled, it is human nature to so do. If the system is bad, it is important that one parent <Col N="882"/>payments are not examined in isolation. The entire gamut of payments, including community welfare payments on housing, must also be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a general statement, people should not be obliged to adjust their lives to fit a particular payment. Their lives are their own and we should respond by supporting them in any way possible. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that it is not good social policy to have people who wish to live together not do so in order to maximise a payment. I am trying to change such occurrences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a difficult question. Particular payments, such as, for example, one parent family payments, are intended to benefit one parent families. If there is not a one parent family because people have chosen to live together, a one parent family payment is no longer appropriate. At the same time, however, such people have expenses. We must try to provide the same level of funds to such households, while moving away from the cohabitation issue. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about any couple who decide not to live together, purely to maximise payments. That is not good social policy. I have asked the Department to examine all the schemes which may act as a disincentive to people living together. We will try to amend them as we go along. My priority is one parent family payments. The Deputy has asked me to consider community welfare payments in respect of housing. I must discuss it with my colleagues and I will do so.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the position in regard to the promised review of his decision to withdraw the &euro;9 per week fuel allowance that was previously paid to pensioners living in sheltered housing in inner city Dublin; if he will reverse the decision in view of the relatively small amounts involved and the potential hardship for persons who will lose out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[37218/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments with the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from the end of September to mid-April. A total of 274,000 customers benefit under the scheme at a cost of &euro;85.4 million this year.</P>
        <P>As a long-standing policy within the scheme, fuel allowances have not been payable in situations where a person has access to their own fuel supply or is benefiting from a subsidised or <Col N="883"/>low-cost heating service, such as those provided by Dublin City Council at a number of its housing complexes. Local authority tenants who benefit from communal heating arrangements make a fixed contribution towards the cost of heating their homes, typically approximately &euro;6 per week.</P>
        <P>Unlike other tenants and social welfare customers generally, who must buy their own fuel at prevailing retail costs, these tenants are protected from increases in heating costs. The true cost of heating their homes is subsidised by Dublin City Council and the other local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, my Department recently ceased allowances which had been paid in error in a specific number of cases where the recipients were in or had moved to local authority accommodation with subsidised or low-cost heating. The allowances in question, which under current scheme rules should not have been put in payment in the first place, were withdrawn in these cases with effect from the start of this winter heating season. My Department did not seek to recover the money which had been paid in error.</P>
        <P>In addition to the fuel allowance, eligible persons qualify for electricity or gas allowances though the household benefits package payable throughout the year. As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption, so people are protected against unit price increases. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances with special heating needs.</P>
        <P>I am reviewing the position regarding fuel allowances. In view of the cost implications, any changes must be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The fuel issue is the most serious to be faced by the Minister in the budget. A failure on his part to substantially increase the fuel allowance, rather than merely tinkering at its edges, will leave him with a regrettable legacy. All Members know that fuel poverty is one of the biggest issues facing our elderly, particularly given the escalating price of fuel. I refer to the absolutely scandalous increases in oil, electricity and gas prices that must be borne by people, particularly by the elderly. How did the Minister&rsquo;s Inspector Clouseaus manage to find the 237 people who were living in such accommodation in Dublin and the south east? Does the Minister realise that savings of only &euro;1,500 per week are being made in consequence? Moreover, such people pay &euro;6 per week towards their fuel, regardless of whether they use it. They pay &euro;6 for 52 weeks of the year, which comes to &euro;312 per year. However, the Minister&rsquo;s Department only gives them some &euro;260 per annum. Hence, the Minister has caused them to be a great deal worse off.</P><Col N="884"/>
        <P>This is the season of Advent and earlier today, I observed the lighting of the Leinster House Christmas trees. The few miserable shillings taken from the people affected would not pay for the electricity used to light the Christmas trees around the Houses today.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>In the spirit of the season, can this scheme be restored? There should be no more obfuscation, foot-dragging, or side-stepping of a type that would have served Jimmy Keaveney well at his peak. Those 237 people should have the fuel allowances that were taken from them returned. More importantly, Members should make sure that the increase in fuel allowance in the forthcoming budget is sufficient to ensure no one dies of fuel poverty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have mentioned, 237 people were affected. I have already informed the House that I have instructed the Department to examine precisely what happened in this regard. I propose to make a decision on the matter in the near future. As I stated, the matter arose through an error. That said, the fuel allowance was never intended for people whose fuel was paid for in the first place. Such people do not have the same requirement to buy fuel as would someone else whose fuel is not paid for. It is important to note that the fuel of the 237 people affected is paid for by the local authority. Even though their fuel is paid for separately, I have been asked to extend the fuel allowance to them. Because of the nature and manner of what happened, as well as the limited numbers involved, I am disposed to resolve the matter. I intend to do so in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the cut-off point for a low-cost heating service? When does it cease to be a low-cost heating service, that is, what is the threshold above which people are charged for the service? The Minister stated he was engaged in a review of fuel allowances. When did the review start and when does he expect it to be completed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The allowance is means tested. It applies to a number of schemes, including the old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, widows&rsquo; pensions, lone parents&rsquo; allowances, allowances for the blind and so on. It covers a range of schemes and as I noted, some 274,000 people are in receipt of it. It is means tested. I will establish the precise cut-off figure for the Deputy. However, as it is not a particularly significant payment, it is not particularly difficult to get.</P>
        <P>As for the review, I will examine the issue in the context of the budget. I will take the statements made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations, as well as those made in the House, into consideration. Successive Ministers before me took the view that it was better to increase the main rate of social welfare benefit. <Col N="885"/>Consequently, they decided it was better to direct available funds towards increasing the main rates, so that people had access to the money. This explains why there have been fairly major increases across the board in recent years, as far as the main benefits are concerned. However, this was carried out at the expense of a range of ancillary schemes, such as the fuel allowance. That is why the fuel allowance, the child dependant allowance and many other so-called non-main rate allowances were not increased over the years. I am considering whether this policy is still wise and I will conclude my thinking in this regard in advance of the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of the rules regarding the provision of heating in local authority housing? The local authority decides the time of year when heating is available and the times of the day at which it is switched on. As we are likely to have the coldest winter in decades, is the decision to withdraw the fuel allowance from the people in question not foolhardy as well as mean? There needs to be co-ordination between the Department and local authorities regarding how they provide heat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it not make more sense economically to give a lump sum to fuel allowance recipients rather than a weekly allowance? As the Minister knows, it is cheaper if one buys in bulk. It is cheaper to buy coal once per year than to buy a bag per week. I suggest that the Minister consider this in his review and it would not cost him anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In view of the overall debate on cutting the fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week, does the Minister find it unacceptable that, in this very wealthy country, there are still people, particularly the elderly, living in the conditions that have been described? In his review of the scheme, will he listen to the advice of groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which are on the front line dealing with people in poverty and looking after the elderly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe in listening to such groups. I met 35 or more of them in the past year and my officials and I spent an hour or more with each. I have offered each one a second meeting, if it wishes to attend. I am fully available around the clock to talk to the groups and to politicians. As I have said many times, politicians have a special knowledge of this subject because of the clinics they hold every week. They listen to people and hear their stories at first hand. I listen very carefully and the budget will reflect that I have been listening to the groups in question.</P>
        <P>I heard what Deputy Crowe said on the need for an annual payment. The logistics are such that it is easier to make the fuel allowance available with other payments. However, I will give some thought to what the Deputy said.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 21, 27, 38, 60, 85 and 96 together.</P>
        <P>Reducing local authority housing waiting lists is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and neither I nor my Department has any direct role in that regard. However, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.</P>
        <P>In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists. In response to this, the Government has introduced a new rental assistance arrangement giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting, on a phased implementation basis, the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public private partnership-type rental accommodation scheme. These arrangements are intended to comprise a long-term housing option for the people concerned. Some &euro;19 million has been transferred from my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2005 to that of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to finance this initiative and similar arrangements will apply in 2006 and succeeding years as the new arrangements are implemented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rental assistance arrangements will also cater for new applicants for rent supplements and people who have been receiving rent supplement for less than 18 months, as long as the local authority is satisfied they have a long-term housing need. These people will be eligible for some form of assistance from their local authority under the scheme, be it contracted rental accommodation, voluntary housing or a local authority house. Local authorities are in the process of negotiating <Col N="888"/>with landlords to form a stock of contracted accommodation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new arrangements are being implemented in 11 local authority areas and arrangements are due to be initiated in all local authority areas by the end of 2005. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that 56 tenants have been accommodated under the rental accommodation scheme by November of this year and that a further group of up to 200 will be accommodated this December. An initial independent evaluation of the implementation process will be undertaken in 2006 and it will consider remaining issues. Some 59,677 households are in receipt of assistance under the rent supplement scheme. Over half of these, almost 33,000 tenants, have been on the scheme for 18 months or more. My Department and the Health Service Executive are actively assisting the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in implementing the new arrangements. For example, the latter Department has been supplied with detailed information on the 33,000 people who have been on rent supplement for 18 months or more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the target set earlier this year has been missed totally? Will he confirm what the target was when the scheme was first introduced? Was it not to deal with 5,000 cases by the end of this year? Will he explain why only 56 families have been transferred? Will he guarantee that this figure will increase to 356 by the end of this year?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister confident that the scheme will work in spite of the failure so far to meet the very modest target to deal with 5,000 cases by the end of this year and given that 33,000 people are awaiting transfer? If the scheme is unsuccessful, as has been the case to date, what action will the Minster take to alleviate the obvious hardship suffered by people dependent on the emergency payment made under the community welfare schemes? What has gone wrong? Why is the scheme not working as the Minister had planned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the progress has been disappointing. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government tells me it will accommodate 256 people under the rental accommodation scheme by the end of the year. It reckons that up to 33,000 households could benefit eventually under the new arrangements. This would probably cost over &euro;120 million.</P>
        <P>I do not have a note on any particular targets, nor do I recall a target as large as the one suggested. The target is 33,000, in the sense that this is the number of people on the database who have been on rent supplement for over 18 months and who are therefore technically eligible under the scheme.</P><Col N="889"/>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is pressing ahead to determine whether more progress can be made under the scheme. This is the correct approach although progress to date has been disappointing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be appalled if 33,000 people were transferred under the rental accommodation scheme. They need to have their own houses and should not be subject to these short-term arrangements. Having said that, the scheme has some merits.</P>
        <P>In the case of the 56 people who have benefited from the scheme and the further 200 who are to benefit therefrom by the end of the year, is only one landlord involved in the areas where the scheme is piloted? I have been told that, in the case of the Iveagh Trust, in co-operation with Dublin City Council, 50 persons were accommodated by one landlord. It is significantly different to negotiate with one landlord as opposed to many landlords.</P>
        <P>A great deal of negotiation takes place between local authority personnel, landlords and tenants but no additional assistance has been given to local authorities. The Health Service Executive will be relieved of this task and local authorities will assume it. Will the Minister provide assistance by way of personnel to carry out this work? It is unrealistic to expect this scheme to be implemented if the staff are not available to do it. We will see local authority staff chasing around housing estates trying to find landlords with whom they can negotiate. That is hugely time consuming. The local authorities are also concerned about a range of legal issues. The <i>modus operandi</i> of this scheme will indicate whether it will be successful. Can the Minister say if the negotiations were with individual landlords or a group of landlords?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The information I have received from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is that 56 have been accommodated, with up to 256 being accommodated by the end of the year. I do not have a breakdown of whether that is one scheme or a number of schemes. I can get that information for the Deputy. Given how small the number is, I assume it is a small number of schemes as opposed to 256 individually rented houses.</P>
        <P>With regard to staff, obviously the pressure will move to the local authority as the scheme proceeds. I expect the rate of transfers to accelerate significantly over the coming months, particularly through the voluntary housing sector. New template contract arrangements have recently been put in place to enable local authorities to engage additional landlord accommodation capacity under the scheme through a variety of mechanisms. As these additional units start to come on stream, the rate of transfer of people to the scheme should accelerate. Clearly, if there are <Col N="890"/>staffing and resource implications, both Departments will have to address them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of counties were used to pilot this, one of which was County Westmeath. To what extent have those counties achieved the projected outcome with regard to the use of the RAS? Could people who are offered a house by a local authority in an area in which they do not wish to live decide to stay where they are under the RAS? Is there evidence of that emerging? They might wish to stay where they are for a few years rather than move to another area where they might have no relations, for example, moving from the north to the south of a county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The objective should be that moneys that were spent on this should be used to build a significant number of houses to ensure that these people do not remain within the private rented system for a long time. Is that not the best way out of housing poverty and adverse housing conditions? Is it not an indictment of the Government that the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, changed the Planning and Development Act 2000? Many of the people who now find themselves in difficult circumstances would have been far better off if the Government had been sufficiently committed to carry through the objectives passed by this House in that Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rental accommodation scheme is a new, additional housing option whereby a person can opt for either medium or long-term private rented accommodation or social housing or for both. There is a choice. A person can opt to remain in private rental type accommodation provided by the local authority if that best suits the person&rsquo;s needs. Obviously, providing permanent accommodation is the answer. It takes people off the rental schemes and provides them with permanent homes. As always, having that type of security of ownership is better than renting. However, many issues must be worked out as the scheme is implemented. The Deputy asked if people would stay where they are or move. It is a new scheme and they can opt to take part in it or not to take part in it.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that the negotiations with landlords should be quality negotiations to ensure that we do not inherit a cadre of landlords who do not look after their tenants. However, there is also strong landlord and tenant legislation on the Statute Book which should give some comfort in that regard.</P>
        <P>The overall number of houses built is substantial although there appears to be more to do on the social housing side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said three options are available. Of the 56 that have been completed <Col N="891"/>so far, can he give a breakdown as to whether they were voluntary housing, local authority housing or other housing? Of the 200 more that are due to be completed, can he say where they will be facilitated? Given that the two Departments have missed the target for the end of this year, what is their target for the end of next year to judge this scheme? So far, it has failed dismally. What is the target for next year, if any?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P><?oasys _dc14- ?>The ultimate target as of today is, presumably, 33,000 but there is no date for that. We must press ahead and do as much as we can. That number might not remain static because people come in and out of rent supplement. However, that figure is the current number in rent supplement for over 18 months so that remains the target. The number could change if large numbers were to suddenly vanish from the scheme.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a breakdown of the 56. The impression I get from the file is that it is substantially rented accommodation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Private rented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I will clarify it for the Deputy but that is my impression at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear the Minister respond to Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s question about the number of places in the pilot schemes and whether they have been realised. Cork city has one of the pilot schemes and, to my knowledge, while there is negotiation between the city council and the voluntary organisation, the 50 places in question will not be in place by the end of this year. I hope that 50 is not being counted in the total number of 256 given by the Minister. A treble subsidy is given by the State to many private landlords. There is tax relief for building apartment accommodation, tax relief on the rent received from rental accommodation and, as the Minister has mentioned on several occasions, the State pays 40% of all accommodation costs in the State. Is the Minister discussing with his Cabinet colleagues the option of getting rid of this? It must be the only area in which people who own property are getting a treble subsidy from the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The new arrangements are being implemented in 11 local authority areas and arrangements are due to be initiated in all local authority areas by the end of 2005. I can let the Deputy have the names of the areas. Clearly, with 56 completed, they are not widely spread.</P>
        <P>Tax reliefs are a matter for the Minister for Finance. He is reviewing the tax breaks across a range of industries, including construction, in the context of the forthcoming budget. He will deal with that issue. What was the Deputy&rsquo;s other question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="892"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the treble subsidy and the fact that 40% of all rental subsidies are paid by the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>A substantial amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money goes into construction in this country, through pension funds, rent allowances, capital allowances and so forth. If one adds it all together, a great deal of taxpayers&rsquo; money is fuelling the construction boom we are experiencing at present. I agree we should take an overview of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a timescale for the roll-out of this scheme? A similar question was asked but I did not hear the answer. With regard to saving money in the long term, is there evidence that this is happening? Some of the officers involved in the scheme have suggested that because the landlords are getting guaranteed tenants for a certain period, the rents are decreasing. Are there savings for the State? Does the Minister agree that with the population we are discussing, the solution is to provide long-term social housing? Affordable housing and shared ownership, laudable by themselves, are not going to help the people on this scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The timeframe is such that arrangements are being put in place to ensure that all local authority areas initiate the scheme by the end of the year. Clearly it will be into next year before the process is concluded. Some months ago there was evidence that rents were decreasing or levelling off. As Deputy Stanton has stated, it is important that limits are not set that would push up rents, as many people in the State pay rent. This could easily happen. There is recent evidence that rents are beginning to harden once more and we should monitor the issue closely to ensure that an adequate level of rent support is provided without facilitating rises in rent.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s point of social housing being the answer, it is only part of the solution. Many people on rent supplement for more than 18 months aspire to going out into the private housing market themselves at some stage. Our job is to help them get there if that is their wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is based on the last year&rsquo;s income so taking the 18-month timeframe, it is a long way down the road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>If we had an immediate stock of social housing, it would be the answer. As we move down the road we will have a choice for people between rental, voluntary, social and private housing etc. To have a range of options under this scheme is probably the right way to go as one option may not necessarily suit everybody.</P>

	<P>When was the &euro;19 million transferred? Was it intended to cover all of 2005 or is the intention that the funding will roll into 2006 and 2007? If it does not roll into 2006 and 2007, will further moneys be transferred from the Minister&rsquo;s Department to the other Department next year? If the &euro;19 million was for 2005, how many houses will it provide? Will the Minister confirm the Department of the Environment and Local Government&rsquo;s target of 5,000 for the end of this year, of which I was informed by way of a parliamentary question last June?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The &euro;19 million was designated for 2005 and we did not have an agreement on the number of houses it would supply. It is current money as well as capital in that sense. It is given to the Department of the Environment and Local Government which may use it for acquiring a supply of rented accommodation, if necessary, but can also use it for capital purposes. It is between definitions. The &euro;19 million is to begin the scheme and to get on with the projects. There will not be a second tranche in 2006.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask a question relating to Question No. 60. Does the Minister consider that the residential assistance scheme will replace the provision of social housing for any category of people on it? If so, what will the category of people be? I am surprised by the Minister stating that people who would qualify for a rental assistance scheme or support from a community welfare officer would have any prospect of purchasing a house. They would not qualify for a loan of any description, be it a local authority loan or otherwise. I do not see how there can be a transition for that group of people from rental assistance to owning their own homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The needs of older people have been a priority for this Government since taking office in 1997. Since then we have delivered record increases in pensions. Pensions increased by 81% up to January this year, 50% ahead of the increase in the consumer price index over the same period. The household benefits scheme is now available to all those over 70 years of age regardless of their income or household composition, and a range of other measures, including easing of qualifying conditions for pensions to enable more people to qualify for contributory payments, have been introduced.</P>
        <P>As I indicated at the publication of the 2006 Estimates, older people are a priority for my social reform agenda. The main aims of this agenda are to deliver a decent pension for all our workers, to offer choices on how older people want to spend their later years and to ensure older people have adequate income. In a social welfare context, the Government has already made a number of commitments to pensions and other matters and I will be working to see the targets in this regard are met over the next two budgets. Chief among these commitments is a target rate of &euro;200 per week for pensions to be reached by 2007.</P>
        <P>Significant increases in qualified adult allowances have also been given in recent years and the aim in this regard is to bring these into line with the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. Qualified adult allowance rates for those over 66 are now between 66% and 77% of maximum personal rates compared with <Col N="895"/>between 60% and 67% in 2000. Allowances on invalidity pensions have also been brought up to the level of other contributory pensioner rates.</P>
        <P>One of my priorities is to offer choices to older people on how to spend their later years and I am anxious to ensure the social welfare system does not limit the choices people can make. In this regard, I am examining the different pension schemes to see to what extent we can facilitate more choice for people.</P>
        <P>Occupational pensions are an important part of our overall pension system and, as the House will be aware, I have recently received the report on the national pensions review from the Pensions Board. This is a large and complex document which will need to be fully studied by the Government, and when this is finalised, arrangements will be made to publish the report. I hope it will engender a national debate on our pensions system which will assist us in determining the most appropriate and effective way of delivering a level of income to older people which will allow them to enjoy a long and active retirement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to change the retirement age for old age pensioners shortly, what is his thinking on the issue and when does he intend to make an announcement? Is the Minister aware of problems with private pension schemes that, on maturing, are not really worth much? Is he aware of the deliberations of the most recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, particularly the questions asked by my colleague, Senator Terry? Pensions used to have regard to the qualified adult allowance. Is the Minister aware of representations from the National Women&rsquo;s Council, among other groups, which is concerned at what it sees as an inequity in that area? What is the Minister&rsquo;s thinking in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>To be blunt, is it not time to abolish the limitation rule and to boot out this antiquated social welfare system, which is predicated on male superiority and anathema to the constitutional position? Is it not time to ensure that women are treated equally in the social welfare system?</P>
        <P>The people most victimised by the social welfare system are widows who lose their partners at a vulnerable time. The partner might have worked and contributed to the family income, as well as ensuring that the woman was entitled to a contributory widow&rsquo;s pension following the death of the partner. If the woman works, when she reaches the age of 66 insult is added to injury when her contributions are thrown in the bin. She is not allowed to get her old age pension and retain the widow&rsquo;s pension, which she is entitled to because her husband had paid his contributions until his death. Is it not time we got rid of the anomaly which means that a widow does not get her due entitlement?</P><Col N="896"/>
        <P>Is it not time for a radical overhaul of a social welfare system which came into being in the 1920s, which virtually has not been updated since that time and which has treated women in particular as second class citizens and appendages of their partners?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stanton asked if I have plans to change the retirement age for the old age pension. The answer is no, I have no proposal to change the age limit of 66 years. However, I am interested in what the UK is doing in this area. There may be a case for encouraging those who choose to work for longer to perhaps receive a higher or enhanced pension. Many countries are examining this issue to find how it can be made more friendly for the individual who might want to work and get on. Many people between the ages of 66 and 76 are keen to work and do not wish to have their pensions interfered with if they do so. Our system, in the 21st century, must reflect this. However, I reiterate that the age limit will not change.</P>
        <P>With regard to private pension schemes, the Pensions Board is examining a number of issues with regard to funding. Some companies have holes in their pension schemes and there is a major technical argument as to what constitutes a funding deficit. A safety net system applies in the UK but not in Ireland. My counterparts in the UK tell me that the UK would not take this route again if it had the choice because the system has become more than a safety net and the cost has run to millions of pounds.</P>
        <P>On the qualified adult allowance, I met representatives of the National Women&rsquo;s Council, who explained their thinking in this area and with regard to the issues raised by Deputy Penrose. I have stated many times in the House that the social welfare system is not as fair to women as to men, a fact I will not hide. What we must do is to ascertain whether, through the qualified adult allowance system, we can perhaps find a mechanism for paying the allowance directly. I have asked the Department to examine the matter, particularly with regard to occupational pensions. I realise I am like a long-playing record in this regard but of the 900,000 people without pensions, 500,000 are women. There is a real issue with regard to women and the social welfare system, and I intend to return to the subject.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter concerns hospital configuration in the Health Service Executive eastern region. As we all know, there has been rapid and significant demographic change in the counties of Louth and Meath, and in south Monaghan, east Cavan and north Dublin. Much of this area is served by Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk, Monaghan Hospital and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan.</P>
        <P>For various reasons, all these hospitals have been in the news in recent years. The fact that this is the case graphically illustrates the need for the Department of Health and Children and HSE to stand back and consider the health care infra<Col N="898"/>structure in the area, and decide its adequacy going forward. The best test for the infrastructure is the pressure which will inevitably arise with regard to accident and emergency services and the number of patients who must leave the catchment area to have elective surgery elsewhere. While I do not have access to the relevant statistics, I daresay that the statistics would not be favourable in regard to the range of facilities and outlets available and the number of patients seeking access to them.</P>
        <P>When we talk of a centre of excellence for health care, we inevitability think of a long lead-in period prior to any development. The starting point is a detailed feasibility study that will assess the facilities available before those who will make the decisions get down to the difficult task of quantifying the options. Inevitably, given the parochial nature of debate that tends to surround the provision of health care outlets and hospitals, this will lead in turn to a significant public debate. However, it is a process we must undertake.</P>
        <P>The population is growing and while the county development plans help the region to cope, we may have to seek shorter review periods for the respective development plans to take account of the rapidity with which houses are being built. This housing development in turn leads to increased demand for additional public services such as schools, shops and the range of facilities needed by residents. However, we all agree that the quality of health care available to local communities is top of the agenda. While the existing hospitals have done an excellent job, we must consider the likely position in 15 or 20 years and decide what the region&rsquo;s needs will be at that time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All the indicators point in the same direction. We need a centre of excellence in the eastern region. In the western part of the former North Eastern Health Board region, Cavan Hospital is clearly catering for the needs of its catchment area. I strongly advocate to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children that the Department initiate a feasibility study in this regard as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter. I reply on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.</P>
        <P>The HSE is considering the development of hospital services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk. A major feasibility study was commissioned to investigate the viability of further developing services on the existing site in Drogheda. The HSE in the north east, proposes to progress significant developments including <Col N="899"/>theatres, central sterile services department, pathology, physical medicine, pharmacy and radiology. The accident and emergency project is under way and is scheduled to be completed next year.</P>
        <P>The Department understands that the development plan for the Louth County Hospital is being prepared by the technical services department of the HSE north-eastern region in consultation with staff, and this is now in final draft form. The outline development control plan describes a practical strategy for the comprehensive renewal of Louth County Hospital on the current site. The total redevelopment is to be accomplished through a maximum of five packages of new and refurbished construction, with most clinical and diagnostic services developed in the first two packages. As well as the proposed new construction, it is planned to undertake extensive refurbishment of the existing hospital.</P>
        <P>Interim projects for the hospital include plans agreed and planning permission granted for two interim theatres to be constructed adjacent to the existing day services unit to provide adequate facilities for the joint department of surgery. It is necessary to undertake infrastructural work to the hospital kitchen facility to meet regulatory requirements. Approval of the design team selection has been received. Design will commence following the finalisation of the development and control plan. The HSE is developing the detailed tender and contract documentation specifications and hope to advance the upgrade of electrical works in late 2005 early 2006.</P>
        <P>The development plans for Drogheda and Dundalk now require to be progressed by the National Hospitals Office in the context of its development plans for the region.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Last week the UK branch of Amnesty International published a survey on attitudes to sexual crimes. According to the results of that survey, 34% of people in the United Kingdom regard the victim of rape as being either partially or totally to blame for the act, if she acted in a flirtatious manner.</P>
        <P>While this statistic is shocking an equally worrying parallel exists in Irish society, namely, according to the SAVI survey conducted in 2002, 47% of men versus 34% of women agreed that most rapists commit rape through overwhelming sexual desire. That is highlighted by the 41% of men versus 21% of women who agree that men who sexually assaulted other men must be gay.</P>
        <P>These revelations show that the public perceives rape and sexual assault as sexually motivated crime, not as a violent crime with a sexual element. The SAVI report also revealed that victims of sexual assault who sought professional <Col N="900"/>assistance were deeply dissatisfied with the services they received. The exceptions were counsellors and therapists with whom there was a high level of satisfaction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of 44% of people were dissatisfied with the Garda which did not adequately explain why certain procedures were conducted and the complainants felt there was a perception that they were to blame for the assaults. Those who sought the help of medical professionals felt they needed more assistance. Many said they did not know where to go and were not given advice on where to go. The SAVI report contained several significant recommendations on which I hope to hear progress has been made.</P>
        <P>Both studies showed the under estimation of the extent of the crimes committed. The Amnesty UK report revealed that only 5.6% of rapes were reported. The work of the Rape Crisis Centres has changed significantly in recent years in that a new group of people is presenting to them. Many of these people are victims of rapes that occurred in war situations who have received refuge here. This creates a significant additional difficulty for resources, for example, for those who translate for counsellors, who themselves need to be counselled.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc20- ?>The necessary resources are not being put into public information campaigns, for example, that are very necessary as these reports show. The SAVI report made six or seven significant recommendations. I hope the opportunity provided by the budget will be taken to provide resources to carry out some of those important recommendations which otherwise cannot be put into place.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">If the level of shootings or stabbings was as under-reported as rape and there was a similarly low rate of conviction I imagine there would be a loud outcry. We need to arrive at the point where people see sexual assault in the same light as other types of assault. There is a need for a campaign to inform the public and change its attitudes. There is also a need for resources to provide material to the Rape Crisis Centre which it can pass on to the health care professionals and the Garda so that those who experience such assaults are properly facilitated in every way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of society&rsquo;s response to the very serious crime of rape.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of the survey in question which concluded that there remains a section of the population in the United Kingdom who believe behavioural traits can contribute to a woman being in some way responsible for being raped. There is no doubt that, traditionally at any rate, there have been many terrible misrepresentations of the crime of rape which have added greatly to the suffering of the victims of sexual violence. Society has moved on considerably in the past ten or 20 years and many of the casually <Col N="901"/>offensive assumptions about rape have been thrown out but it would be unrealistic to say that there is no more work to be done before we can consign these views to the past forever.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Government established the national steering committee on violence against women, the NSC, in 1997 to provide a co-ordinated response to the problem of violence against women, rape and other sexual assaults were key priorities and the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland was a member of the committee from the outset.</P>
        <P>The Department, in conjunction with the NSC, has conducted a series of successful awareness-raising campaigns dealing with violence including rape and other sexual violence in recent years. Among these was a poster campaign warning of the dangers of drug rape that occur in pubs, clubs and third level colleges and universities. Grants have also been given to awareness-raising projects run by Rape Crisis Centres in Cork, Kilkenny and Wexford. This year the Department made grants to the Galway Rape Crisis Centre, the Kerry Sexual Abuse Centre, and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre for awareness-raising campaigns during the UN 16 days of action on violence against women. All of these groups have made a significant contribution to tackling society&rsquo;s attitudes to rape and encouraging victims to come forward.</P>
        <P>The NSC is developing a strategic plan for its work over the next five to ten years. The Minister&rsquo;s view is that, while much has been achieved on the awareness-raising front, a new strategic approach is needed in this area. The new strategic plan will include the development of a long-term and wide-ranging strategy for raising public awareness of violence against women in all its manifestations.</P>
        <P>The strategic plan should be completed early next year and will be widely circulated at that time. Rather than rush into a new campaign at this stage, therefore, the Minister believes it would make for a more effective delivery of key messages to approach this issue as part of an overarching and fully integrated strategy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>While awareness-raising is an important part of tackling this problem, work is also ongoing on other fronts to combat rape. Key recent developments include work recently completed by a subgroup of the NSC, chaired by the Department of Health and Children, to identify means of improving forensic and medical services to victims of rape and sexual assault. In recognition of the key role the Rape Crisis Network, Ireland, continues to play in dealing with the crime of rape, grant funding to the organisation for a legal co-ordinator to support its work has been given. The co-ordinator is working closely with the Garda and other relevant agencies with a view to improving the response to victims, including the provision of training.</P>
        <P>Some victims choose not to report sexual assault to the Garda. To understand what can be <Col N="902"/>done about under-reporting and why only a relatively small percentage of reported cases result in a court hearing, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has approved joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research is being carried out by the law department at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the Rape Crisis Network, Ireland. It is being conducted over three years and is expected to be completed in 2007-08. Following completion of this research, action will, as appropriate, be taken by the Department to resolve any issues that may arise. All these initiatives will help to create a better situation for all victims of sexual violence.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this important issue.</P>

	<P>A serious anti-social behaviour problem exists in Tralee town, County Kerry. In 2004, 800 arrests were made in Tralee for public order offences and the trend has continued in 2005. In 2001, I carried out a crime survey in Tralee and up to 88% of parents who responded expressed concern that their sons or daughters might be assaulted when out at night in Tralee town centre. These parents&rsquo; fears have not been allayed. Recently, a local member of the Garda Representative Association highlighted the need for additional garda&iacute; in Tralee following public order incidents over the Hallowe&rsquo;en bank holiday weekend when teenage thugs targeted elderly people and children in Kerins Park and other residential areas. The member of the association claimed that Tralee needed at least 12 extra garda&iacute; and that otherwise a member of the force may be killed or seriously injured on duty because of inadequate back-up.</P>
        <P>In 1996 the population of Tralee town was 19,056. Garda numbers in 1997 amounted to 76, representing all ranks. In 2002, the population was 20,375 while Garda numbers increased to 86. The current population of the town is approximately 27,000 people, an increase of 32.5% since 1996. However, Garda numbers remain at 86, an increase of only 14% since 1996. In this period, the population has increased by more than 8,000 people, including non-nationals and asylum seekers.</P>
        <P>Garda&iacute; have more duties and responsibilities, and have to be meticulous when writing up reports in order that they will stand up in court. We are dealing with a more violent society than ten years ago. The CCTV system is not working to its full capacity, posing additional problems for <Col N="903"/>the Garda when securing convictions in court because of the lack of supporting evidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today, representatives of the Tralee Taxi Drivers Association travelled to the D&aacute;il to outline their concerns at what is happening in the town. There have been several attacks on taxi drivers ranging from minor to life-threatening abuses. They outlined one incident where a knife was held to a taxi driver&rsquo;s throat and he was subsequently robbed. The thug involved was later allegedly involved in a rape case in the town and, to my knowledge, is still on the streets. They outlined to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, that street violence at the weekend is rapidly increasing. Juvenile thugs walking the streets are highly dangerous and intimidating, and generally parents and guardians are unavailable when needed and cannot be contacted.</P>
        <P>The representatives of the association presented 22 questions to the Minister of State for a response, and I hope the replies will soon be forthcoming. I call on the Minister of State to immediately increase Garda numbers in Tralee to deal with the escalating problem of anti-social behaviour and other crimes. CCTV systems must be made fully operational, as it is a technical matter.</P>
        <P>The responsibility of crime control must be shared across society in a proactive way. We depend exclusively on the Garda to protect us. A local consultative policing committee must be established in Tralee by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a pilot project. It can include nominees of the Health Service Executive, Tralee Urban District Council, Kerry education service, community and sporting organisations, the Garda chief superintendent and the three community garda&iacute;. This would ensure responsibility for crime control is effectively shared across the community in a proactive way. The three local Members accompanied the representatives of the Tralee Taxi Drivers Association who met the Minister of State. This gives a clear message that this is problem affects every sector of the community in Tralee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for allowing me one minute of his time.</P>
        <P>I substantiate all that Deputy Deenihan has said on this issue. At the coalface of this enormous problem are the taxi drivers who provide a service late on a Friday and Saturday night, bringing young people back to their homes. They put up with terrible abuse, as well as violence. When we met the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, we were informed of the crime levels reported in Tralee. However, we did not hear of the crimes that go unreported, which is a substantial number, because I deal with it on a daily basis in my constituency clinic.</P>
        <P>Behind this is the factor of fear. Victims fear that if they report crimes, they will be further vic<Col N="904"/>timised. I want the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give this problem his immediate attention. I cannot stress strongly enough the fear and abuse taxi drivers in Tralee endure on a nightly basis. Residents in housing estates also have to endure a minority of young people behaving like thugs and gangsters, terrorising communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social and unlawful behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard. Because of the Minister&rsquo;s concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, he brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One provision in the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, originally introduced to combat under age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 is to provide the Garda with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off-licences, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the Public Order Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, while it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. The Minister has promised these additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. The Garda funding which the Minister secured in the 2006 Estimates is at a historical high of over &euro;1.29 billion, com<Col N="905"/>pared with just &euro;600 million in 1997. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 will be &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This will greatly aid the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and crime prevention.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The Minister was pleased to note a reduction in assault causing harm in 2004 compared with 2003. This trend has continued in 2005 with a 10.5% reduction in assaults causing harm, a 7.8% reduction in intoxicating liquor offences and a 4.4% reduction in public order offences in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes the courts can give valuable support and protection to our communities in tackling anti-social behaviour. In this regard, he is finalising proposals to provide for anti-social behaviour orders and intends to introduce these proposals as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The proposal will allow the Garda to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order which will prohibit the person who is the subject of the order from behaving in an anti-social manner. The orders will be civil orders and the question of an offence will arise only if the person in question wilfully defies the order and continues to engage in the anti-social behaviour which is the subject of the order. The Minister believes anti-social behaviour orders used in the most glaring cases will be of real value in curbing this type of behaviour.</P>
        <P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 29 of the Bill which provides for a fixed penalty procedure for lesser public order offences. The procedure will apply to certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, namely, intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. The Minister attaches great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities on matters affecting policing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is preparing guidelines, with the assistance of his colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, on the composition of the joint policing committees. His view is that the best way to move this process forward is to establish a small number of joint policing committees on a pilot basis and he is consulting on the matter. Setting up a small number of pilot committees will provide an opportunity to identify any teething problems which may arise.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned legislation the Minister has already introduced to combat the abuse of alcohol and the public order problems to which it gives rise. In addition, the Minister has recently published the general scheme of an intoxicating liquor Bill which will carry forward this work. The main purpose of the proposed legislation is to streamline and modernise our liquor licensing laws.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>With regard to Tralee, the Minister has been made aware of the incidences of anti-social behaviour in the town. The document circulated to Deputies contains specific information on the position regarding Tralee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I address my comments to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who is not present. I was appalled by a reply she issued to my Question No. 433 on 29 November, which asked for details of the number of schools in Dublin 1, 3 and 7 that have suffered a reduction in resource teachers this school year. The Minister refused to answer the question stating that the specific information was &ldquo;not readily available&rdquo;. This is simply not credible as it would take the relevant officials a matter of minutes to establish the position. I trust it is not the case that the Minister did not want to know the answer to my question.</P>
        <P>The Minister then listed the so-called benefits of the new allocation system for learning support resource teachers. This mechanism fails to recognise the glaring failing in the system, namely, the fact that the allocation is now based on school size rather than the level of need in specific schools. This means that small inner city schools and small disadvantaged schools generally, which have a disproportionately high level of need, lose out. The very schools in which learning support plays a critical role in the educational development of so many children in need are losing out. In these schools resources are essential to give the children any real chance to counteract the social problems, drugs issues and educational deprivation in their living environment.</P>
        <P>Additional investment in learning support rather than the removal of resources is what these schools desperately need. This is the reason 14 inner city schools have raised serious concerns on this issue with the Minister&rsquo;s officials. The Minister should meet the principals of the schools in question. I have no doubt she would then accept the real damage the current allocation system is causing and will continue to cause.</P>
        <P>Last night I attended a meeting of parents and teachers in the INTO headquarters in Parnell Square. The main hall and surrounding hallways were packed with nearly 400 parents, teachers, principals, child psychologists and so on. Those attending were understandably angry at the inept approach to learning support allocation in so far as it affects small disadvantaged schools with a high level of need. Teachers and parents expressed outrage that at a time of considerable affluence critical resources are being withdrawn from these schools. These resources had begun to make a significant difference to the degree to which the schools in question could help deprived children.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister to address this issue now. The level of need in each of the 14 schools must be known to her Department. If that is not the <Col N="907"/>case, it is time she ensured the relevant information was made available to her. She must also defer any threat to remove resource teachers or reduce resource hours in any small disadvantaged school. Investment in alleviating educational disadvantage must involve increasing resources in inner city disadvantaged schools or it becomes meaningless. How can the Minister even countenance reducing resources in schools serving Sheriff Street, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Summerhill, Ballybough and Greek Street, to mention just a few areas? Investment in schools in these areas will pay dividends in future.</P>
        <P>If the Minister is serious about addressing disadvantage, she will meet the people on the front line of disadvantage, the principals of the inner city schools, and listen to what they have to say. Not only will she not meet them, she will not come into the House to respond to the matter I raise. She is running away from her responsibilities on this issue. She was in the coffee dock 20 minutes ago in full knowledge that I intended to raise this matter on the Adjournment, yet decided to allow another Minister to answer on her behalf. That is a disgrace and shows disrespect to the parliamentary procedures of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the general allocation of learning support-resource teachers is intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs. The system was constructed so that learning support-resource teachers&rsquo; allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>The new system has a number of benefits associated with it. It puts resources in place on a more systematic basis thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels, facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols, reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services.</P>
        <P>In introducing the general allocation system transitional arrangements were also introduced whereby transitional hours were allocated to schools to cater for children for whom individual teaching resources had previously been allocated but which it would not have been possible for the school to continue to provide from its general allocation. In the circumstances no child would lose his or her resource teaching support. It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation.</P><Col N="908"/>
        <P>More than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools now work directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This figure compares with a figure of fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Moreover, one in five primary school teachers now works specifically with children with special needs. I am also pleased that over the next two years 500 extra teachers will be allocated in primary schools to reduce class size and tackle disadvantage.</P>
        <P>With regard to the inner city schools referred to by the Deputy, officials from the Department of Education and Science have discussed the concerns of these schools with the Irish National Teachers Organisation and requested that the schools in question send any information they believe supports a case for additional special needs supports to the Department. The Department awaits full details so the concerns of the schools can be considered.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that, taking account of their allocation this year, including the general allocation model, a number of these schools enjoy exceptionally favourable pupil-teacher ratios with an average of 10:1.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has introduced a new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS. A key element of DEIS is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantaged experienced. This standardised system will replace all existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the SSP on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>
        <P>The Department anticipates being in a position to notify participating schools in regard to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year. The Government, particularly the Minister for Education and Science, is deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special needs.</P>

	<P>The construction federation operatives pensions scheme operates as a registered employment agreement under the Industrial Relations Acts. There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. The Pensions Board also has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act are concerned. However, the main difficulties with the scheme relate to failure to register employees and-or to deduct contributions to the scheme and these issues are a matter for the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Board has a very limited role in ensuring compliance with the scheme in question. However, because of ongoing controversy in relation to the scheme and compliance with its terms, the board recently facilitated a report on the scheme in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>The report was undertaken by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and it found that 80% of the estimated 80,000 eligible employees in the industry are covered by the scheme. However, the report does highlight the fact that an estimated 70,000 operatives are classed as self-employed and are therefore not eligible to join the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mercer have made a range of recommendations designed to improve compliance with the scheme involving the Departments of Enterprise Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. Copies of the report have been provided to the relevant Ministers. The Pensions Board is, I understand, convening a meeting <Col N="910"/>shortly to explore the various recommendations made by Mercer with the relevant Departments.</P>
        <P>Following a meeting I had with trade unions representing construction workers, I wrote to the Minister for Finance requesting that the companies awarded public sector contracts should be fully compliant as regards the requirements under the construction federation operatives pensions scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 43, 49, 87 and 150 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to census 2002, there are 48,500 people providing personal care for over four hours per day. Over 25,700 of these are in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. This means that almost 53% of the 48,500 carers, estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than four hours per day, are in receipt of a specific carer&rsquo;s payment from my Department.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment <Col N="911"/>rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>The report of the joint Oireachtas committee, which I examined when it was published last year, makes a range of recommendations, many of which relate to my Department and a number of which concern the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>In response to the committee, who stated that the greatest need identified by family carers is the need for a break from caring, I made provision in budget 2005 to improve and extend the respite care grant in the following ways: first, from June this year, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s commitment in our programme for Government to introduce significant increases in the value of the respite care grant, I increased the amount of the grant from &euro;835 to &euro;1,000 annually; second, provision was made for the extension of the grant to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their means. This means that the respite care grant is now paid to persons providing full time care but who are on another social welfare payment, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit. It is also paid to carers who do not currently receive a weekly social welfare payment from my Department. The grant continues to be paid automatically to those who are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s payments; third, the grant is now being paid in respect of each person receiving care. This means that a carer who is providing care for more than two people receives a grant in respect of each person for whom she or he is caring. Previously a maximum of two grants was paid. I have done this to recognise the particular challenges which are faced by carers who are caring for several people.</P>
        <P>To date, almost 31,000 respite care grants have been paid by my Department and applications for the grant continue to be received.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Carers Association&rsquo;s Towards a Family Carer&rsquo;s Strategy, I had the pleasure last May of launching that strategy. The strategy is a focused document with very clear objectives and actions. These objectives and actions cover a range of areas and Government Departments, including income support and health related issues. I was particularly interested in the views expressed in the strategy in relation to encouraging carers to participate in the labour force. As I have previously mentioned in the House, care-sharing situations can now be accommodated on the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>This measure allows two carers who are providing full-time care in an established pattern, for example every second week, to share the carer&rsquo;s allowance income support payment and the <Col N="912"/>annual respite care grant. Both carers will receive the household benefits package of free schemes.</P>
        <P>My Department can also accommodate the carer who is providing care, say on alternate weeks, and where the care recipient attends a residential institution on the other week. All of the usual qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance will apply to carers availing of these arrangements. This increased flexibility in the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme will allow carers to combine the provision of care to a person who requires full-time care and attention and participation in the labour force if that is what they wish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have mentioned in the House before that a Long-Term Care Working Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my own Department is due to report to the T&aacute;naiste and to me shortly. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. The issues raised in the Carers Association&rsquo;s strategy are also included in the group&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. I will continue to review the issues raised by the Carers Association, the joint Oireachtas committee and other bodies representing carers and I will continue to strive to bring forward proposals that recognise the valued and valuable contribution of carers in a tangible way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the face of rapid population aging the OECD considers that there is a need to promote better employment opportunities for older people. Much of the focus in this area revolves around the reform of social welfare pensions systems and early retirement schemes but the OECD points to the need for a broader reform agenda which includes welfare systems, employment and dismissal procedures in firms, employment services for older jobseekers, working conditions and wage and training practices.</P>
        <P>In 2001 the OECD Employment, Labour and Social Affairs Committee decided, as a contribution to driving this agenda, to carry out a thematic review of policies to improve labour market prospects for older workers. Separate country reports have been prepared for each of the 21 countries that have participated in this review. <Col N="913"/>Each country report analyses the main existing barriers to the employment of older people, assesses the coherence and effectiveness of policies in removing these barriers and presents a set of recommendations on measures that Government should implement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The OECD report on Ireland has not yet been published but there was some publicity in relation to the conclusions of the report in connection with a High-Level Policy Forum on Aging and Employment Policies run by the OECD in Brussels on 17 and 18 October. However, I understand that the report on Ireland will be launched on 5 December as part of the 4th F&Aacute;S annual labour market conference.</P>
        <P>The report is wide-ranging and focuses on improving employment prospects for older people aged 50 to 64 and prolonging working lives past normal retirement age. In this regard, as I have said before, we should do everything possible to facilitate people who wish to continue working after normal retirement age. In relation to the social welfare system the Government is committed to removing the requirement for a person to retire before they can receive the retirement pension.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have publicly stated on a number of occasions, I firmly believe that everyone in this country should be entitled to a decent pension in retirement, and it is that belief that has guided my decision to accelerate ways to tackle the pensions problem. As the situation now stands, out of a current workforce of 2 million people, in the region of 900,000 do not have a private or occupation pension. Unless this trend is aggressively addressed and reversed then hundreds of thousands of people will face into a retirement on the basic social welfare pension. That is why I brought forward the statutory national review by the Pensions Board by more than a year. I have now received that review and among its suggestions and recommendations are ideas on allowing people to defer claiming the State pensions and in return to receive a higher pension when they do decide to claim. However, incentives in the social welfare system to prolong working lives are only part of the equation as overall there is a need for a fundamental change in the attitudes of both employers and older workers to working longer.</P>

	<P>My Department engages consultancy expertise under three main headings. In the first instance consultancy is sought for a number of strategic multi-annual programmes aimed at enhancing the delivery of the Department&rsquo;s services. The second type are technical consultancies relating to the ongoing development of information technology systems. The final type is a consultancy assistance in other areas such as policy development, advertising and information.</P>
        <P>My Department paid &euro;1.87 million in 2000 for consultancy support. The figures for 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 were &euro;3.605 million, &euro;4.704 million, &euro;1.975 million and &euro;2.822 million respectively. The amount to end of September 2005 was &euro;2.209 million.</P>
        <P>My Department has comprehensive structures in place to oversee the procurement and management of consultancy support. A Project Governance Committee, comprising members of senior management oversees the prioritisation of projects and the allocation of funds for those projects. Project boards are established in respect of individual projects to ensure that they deliver according to plans and that value for money is achieved.</P>
        <P>With regard to the engagement of consultants, I can assure the Deputy that, a rigid procurement process is undertaken in line with EU rules and public sector procurement guidelines. The achievement of value for money is the central criterion throughout the process. Once a preferred bidder has been identified, my Department agrees a contract, which details the scope of the services to be provided by the consultants and the deliverables to be achieved, to reflect value for money. In line with such contracts, payments are made in respect of the services delivered and deliverables to be achieved, provided the deliverables meet the expectations in all respects.</P>
        <P>My Department has participated in a capacity building exercise developed by the national public procurement policy unit, NPPPU, of the Department of Finance. It continues to be an active participant of the NPPPU as well as a member of the Government Contracts Committee. Accordingly, it advocates and is an active contributor in creating principles aimed at achieving the highest standards in procurement practices.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has approved a policy framework that aims to facilitate a smarter and more professional approach to public procurement by Departments. This policy requires Departments to develop a corporate procurement strategy and procurement plan to set targets to achieve savings, and identify the appropriate structural changes in their organisations.</P>
        <P>In line with this approach, my Department has formed a project group charged with developing a corporate procurement strategy. The group is representative of those areas of the Department critically involved in procurement. Central to the <Col N="915"/>role of the group is the aim of achieving a strategy and plan which has value for money as a primary objective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>The number of families benefiting from the family income supplement scheme on 18 November 2005 was 16,650. Family income supplement, FIS, is a payment made to low income families with children who are in employment but on low earnings, thereby preserving the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were fully reliant on social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Weekly payments of FIS are made to families, including one-parent families, with children, where one or more parent is in full-time remunerative employment of not less than 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight, where the employment is likely to last at least three months, and where the income of the family is less than a prescribed weekly threshold. This threshold varies in line with the number of children in the family. This Government has increased the weekly income thresholds for qualification for a family income supplement payment by &euro;84 since 2002. This has resulted in a net increase in FIS available to low income families of &euro;50.40 per week.</P>
        <P>The number of families with incomes below these thresholds who are eligible for family income supplement are not directly comparable with income statistics compiled by the Revenue Commissioners for a number of reasons, including the fact that the Revenue data does not, generally speaking, take into account the number of hours worked, the number of children in a family, nor social welfare income which might not be taxed but would still be taken into account for FIS. Migrant workers in low-income employment may qualify for FIS in the same way as other applicants.</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their entitlements under the family income supplement scheme. However, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants was actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher, at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure. It is expected that the ESRI will produce more recent data on family income supplement in the first quarter of 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department undertakes a number of proactive measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to family income supplement. These include advising all newly awarded one parent family payment recipients, advising all employers annually in PRSI mailshots and examining entitlement for all recipients of the back to work scheme.</P>
        <P>FIS has also been extensively advertised on local and national press and radio, in poster campaigns and targeted mailshots. Information on all social welfare schemes is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website and from any of the Department&rsquo;s local offices. While there has been extensive publicity, I am concerned that people who may be entitled to FIS are not applying for it and I will continue to review the adequacy of measures to promote greater awareness.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which he intends to assist persons who are dependent on social welfare in becoming financially independent; the success of his Department in helping long-term dependants on social welfare to achieve a better standard of income and living; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently announced that total spending on social welfare will increase in 2006 to a total of &euro;12.49 billion even before announcements of further social welfare spending are made as part of the Government&rsquo;s broader budget package. The vast bulk of this spending meets the costs of payments to persons who through no fault of their own find themselves in circumstances where they need resources to meet the needs of everyday life. These circumstances include unemployment, ill health and old age and many of my Department&rsquo;s payments are explicitly linked to these contingencies.</P>
        <P>Such spending has a major impact on the lives of people. Research on who benefits from social welfare spending shows that the bulk of spending goes to meet the needs of those on lowest incomes. This was also borne out in the 2003 EU <Col N="917"/>survey on income and living conditions, or EU-SILC, which showed that social transfers as a percentage of gross income in the lower income group ranged from 94% to 68%.</P>
        <P>Clearly, without the supports provided by my Department, such persons would fall way below the level of resources required to sustain an acceptable standard of living and quality of life.</P>
        <P>For a considerable number of persons of working age, the need for this assistance is purely temporary and such persons return to financial independence relatively quickly. However for a variety of reasons such as difficulties with employability, long-term illness or disability, it may be difficult for such persons to return to or take up employment. Through a wide range of measures, my Department aims to address these underlying difficulties, thereby allowing the persons to take up work and to reduce or indeed eliminate dependence on the social welfare system. Through the introduction of earnings disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments, many recipients can take up some work without losing out financially.</P>
        <P>The principle of progressing from unemployment through appropriate programmes in order to gain employment or improve employability is well accepted in the social welfare system as the best means of tackling social exclusion. In this context, a wide range of employment support programmes is available, playing a vital role in preventing the problems that arise from long periods of unemployment and proactively facilitating those unemployed to seek work.</P>
        <P>The national employment action plan is one of my Department&rsquo;s primary interventions to support and encourage unemployed people to progress towards employment. It is particularly focused on early intervention, with all those receiving unemployment payments for six months being referred F&Aacute;S for assessment of the progression path most suited to his or her needs. This early intervention helps prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. An integral part of the successful implementation of the NEAP is an offer of work or the availability of a programme suited to the particular needs of the individual. Such programmes raise the educational or training levels of participants, improving the likelihood of employment and prospects of further advancement. The programmes provided by my Department included the back to work allowance and the back to education allowances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Facilitators were appointed from 1993 to advise and encourage those on social security payments such as unemployed people and lone parents to progress to employment or education/training through the wide range of active labour market programmes available. They also seek out job opportunities, work/skills outlets and other self-development opportunities. Facilitators work closely with F&Aacute;S and the education authorities at local level to secure an appropriate outcome for disadvantaged individuals.</P><Col N="918"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that social security programmes are developed in ways that are effective in meeting the needs of the unemployed and other disadvantaged people. Reviews of the back to work and the back to education allowances have shown that the programmes are relatively successful in meeting their objectives. However, the schemes will continue to be monitored and reviewed to ensure that they help recipients avoid long term dependency on social welfare payments and also that they are structured in a way that reflects changing circumstances and aspirations.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to maintaining a viable network of post offices throughout the country. The development and installation of any new technology which An Post might make available in post offices is a commercial matter for the company and that of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who is the Minister responsible for An Post. I have no role or function in this regard.</P>
        <P>In 1992 my Department and An Post entered into a five-year contract for the delivery of social welfare payments. This contract was renewed in 1997 for a further three years to the end of 1999. The Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999 to extend my Department&rsquo;s contractual arrangements with An Post gave rise to a procurement complaint being lodged with the European Commission in 2000. The complaint was subsequently referred to the European Court of Justice by the European Commission. An oral hearing of the European Court of Justice case is expected to take place in 2006. An undertaking given to the European Commission precludes my Department from entering into any arrangement with An Post which would alter the terms of the current payment delivery service.</P>
        <P>In the interim, the current arrangements which exist between my Department and An Post for the delivery of social welfare payments will continue. A very good working relationship exists between my Department and An Post and officials from both sides meet on a regular basis to discuss operational and management issues relating to the delivery of social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Currently, 56% of customers receive payment through their local post office, 10% are paid by cheque through the postal system and 34% have <Col N="919"/>chosen to be paid electronically by direct payment to their bank or building society account.</P>
        <P>In 2004 over 39 million payments were issued through post offices at a cost of &euro;48.6 million. At present 777,000 customers on long-term schemes are paid by means of a book of personalised payable orders which are encashable each week at a post office designated by the customer. Another 312,000 child benefit customers also receive their payment by personalised payable order books on a monthly basis at post offices. A further 133,000 customers, mainly on unemployment schemes, are paid by means of an electronic or manual postdraft which is issued to the customer&rsquo;s designated post office each week. My objective is to ensure that a wide choice of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually improved by providing access to an increasing range of payment services.</P>
        <P>It is also Government policy to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland. In this context, I have initiated a strategic review of my Department&rsquo;s payment requirements with the aim of identifying a payment solution for the future which will be flexible, cost-effective, customer focused, manageable and accountable. The study, which is ongoing, will take account of current market offerings in the financial services sector and advances in card-based technologies with a view to seeing how future needs might best be met.</P>
        <P>An Post and my Department have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State. I am confident that An Post and the other networks of post offices will continue to play a role in the delivery of social welfare payments in the future. I am aware that An Post is conscious of the need to introduce modern payment systems. My expectation is that An Post will respond to developments and product innovation in the money transmission market so that it can maintain its position as a leading player in this area of commercial activity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 35 together.</P>
        <P>The causes of poverty and its effects are multi-faceted and require an integrated, multi-policy response for application at national, regional and local levels. The Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to tackling poverty was initially provided through the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, which was introduced in 1997. This strategy has now been subsumed into the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion, NAP-inclusion. Ireland has produced two NAP-inclusion covering the periods 2001-03 and 2003-05 respectively, as part of the EU open method of co-ordination aimed at making &ldquo;a decisive impact on poverty&rdquo; by 2010. The third NAP-inclusion, to cover the period 2006-08, is scheduled to be introduced in September next year.</P>
        <P>The current NAP-inclusion contains a series of commitments across the relevant policy areas accompanied, where appropriate, by targets, including targets to increase participation in employment, to improve levels of educational attainment, to improve access to services and good quality housing. A recent review of implementation of the NAP-inclusion has shown that some 51 of its 58 targets and commitments had either been met or were in the process of being met.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>As Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I have lead responsibility for driving this process, working closely with my ministerial colleagues through the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The Office for Social Inclusion, OSI, in my Department co-ordinates the process at official level through ongoing liaison with individual Departments, its own management group of Assistant Secretaries, the senior officials group on social inclusion, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and the social inclusion consultative group, composed of representatives of the social partners and the community and voluntary sector.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>To prepare for the third plan, OSI is currently engaged in a process of consultation with all relevant stakeholders &mdash; those who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion and those who work to support them either directly or indirectly. Initially written submissions from interested parties were invited and a total of 76 submissions have been received.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the last two weeks, a series of direct regional consultations have taken place in Dublin, Carlow, Cork, Limerick, Mullingar, Carrick-on-Shannon and Donegal. These public consultations provide those who attend with an opportunity to contribute their views and experiences. This consultation process will culminate with the Social Inclusion Forum, which is to be held in Dublin in early 2006.</P>
        <P>This Government remains strongly committed to tackling poverty. One way of ameliorating the <Col N="921"/>effects of poverty is through welfare payments and without such payments the &lsquo;at risk of poverty rate&rsquo; would be about 17.5% higher. The Government&rsquo;s track record in this regard is a clear testimony to our continued commitment to tackling poverty. In my own area of social welfare, spending has more than doubled from &euro;5.7 billion in 1997 to &euro;12.25 billion in 2005, providing very significant real increases in payments during this period. As a result, in the period 2001 to 2005, the lowest social welfare rates increased by 40% while the consumer price index increased by just over 13%. Child benefit rates increased by 65% over the same period, while from 2002 to 2005, pensioners received increases of &euro;44.71 per week.</P>
        <P>In drawing attention to these increases, I am not complacent about the current situation. Much more remains to be done to tackle the problems of poverty and exclusion experienced by persons in the most vulnerable groups and areas. Our work must continue. I am determined, therefore, through vigorous implementation and development of the strategic process, in full consultation with all the stakeholders at national, regional and local levels, to continue to build and improve on our achievements so far. I am also examining specific targeted measures that could be introduced to address areas of particular concern such as child poverty and pensioner poverty.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 84 and 91 together.</P>
        <P>The Government acknowledges that the risk of poverty tends to be higher among one parent families, larger families and those faced by long-term unemployment, due mainly to the direct costs of rearing children, including child care costs, and the opportunity costs related to the reduced earning capacity of parents, arising from their care responsibilities. This applies particularly to one parent families as the lone parent has to be the main breadwinner and carer at the same time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is generally accepted that for all people in working age households, the main route out of poverty is through employment. The national employment action plan is my Department&rsquo;s principal intervention measure to support and encourage unemployed people to progress towards employment. It is particularly focused on early intervention, with all those receiving unemployment payments for six months being referred to the national employment service, F&Aacute;S, for assessment of the progression path most suited to their needs. This early intervention helps prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. lone parents are not covered by the national employment action plan.</P>
        <P>Employment participation among lone parents in this country is among the lowest in the OECD. This is despite the huge employment growth in recent years, increased female participation in the workforce and the income disregards afforded to lone parents who take up employment under my Department&rsquo;s one parent family payment.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to payments under the current scheme is also contingent on the claimant not co-habiting with another adult. However, I am aware that reluctance on the part of some parents to forego the income security provided by the one parent family payment may act as a disincentive to the formation of partnerships and ultimately marriage for recipients. In addition, as one of the qualifying conditions for payment states that a parent must be the main carer of the child, I am also aware that the scheme as it currently operates may not sufficiently facilitate or promote joint parenting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the key tasks in the Ending Child Poverty initiative under Sustaining Progress is to address obstacles to employment for lone parents. The senior officials group on social inclusion was mandated late last year to examine this issue and report back to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion with specific proposals. A sub-group of the senior officials group has been examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information.</P>
        <P>We must also look closely at income supports and at how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for <Col N="923"/>those who receive these payments. In this regard, a working group established in my Department to review the income support arrangements for lone parents, has looked at issues including the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, cohabitation, maintenance and secondary benefits. A consultation process with social partners and other interested parties was also undertaken to inform the work of the group. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has been updated on the progress of both working groups and I will be bringing the final reports to Cabinet shortly.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the outcome of these reviews, together with initiatives already in place in my Department, will contribute to the ongoing development of proposals designed to better support and encourage both lone parents and those seeking work in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, a better future for themselves and their children, and a more appropriate social policy in the future. The reforms that I am examining have at their core the ambition of improved opportunities and not short term revenue savings.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the European Commission&rsquo;s new proposed portability of pensions directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[37132/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Commission has recently published the Proposal for a Directive on Improving the Portability of Supplementary Pension Rights, commonly referred to as the pension portability directive. The purpose of the directive is to facilitate free movement of workers within and between EU member states by removing obstacles to mobility within and between member states which may be caused by present supplementary pension scheme provisions.</P>
        <P>The draft directive covers second pillar pension plans. It does not include statutory or mandatory employer plans that are already covered under EC Regulation 1408/71 on social security schemes for workers. My Department has primary responsibility for negotiating and transposing the requirements of the directive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU Commission says there is empirical evidence that mobile workers risk ending their careers with lower supplementary pension rights than employees who remain with the same employer during their entire career; and that workers will be less inclined to move to another job when they know that their pension rights at the end of their career will be reduced. With the prospect of increasing numbers of employees covered by supplementary pension provision the <Col N="924"/>Commission consider that this problem is likely to continue to increase.</P>
        <P>The perceived obstacles to mobility relate to the conditions of acquisition of occupational pension rights, the preservation of dormant pension rights, the transferability of acquired occupational pension rights and provision of information to employees on their pension rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland is already compliant with many of the requirements of the directive. For example, the Pensions Act already provides for transferability of pension rights, preservation of rights for those who leave the scheme and revaluation of those accrued rights. These conditions apply whether the person is moving within the State or, subject to Revenue law, within the EU member states. However, there are some additional conditions which will impact on costs for schemes. For example, the directive specifies a minimum waiting period of one year for access to a scheme. Under current legislation, there are no legal maximum waiting periods. This requirement may result in employers having to fund for higher benefits and possibly higher administration costs for these schemes. In relation to public sector schemes, a number of issues arise mainly because transfers are generally restricted to the public sector network and, within that network, transfers relate to service rather than the transfer of a capital sum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At EU level, discussions at the social questions group have just commenced. Ireland raised these and other issues during the course of recent negotiations at the group under the UK Presidency. Most member states have raised issues with the directive and these will all need to be discussed in detail in the group. The next meeting is scheduled for mid-January 2006 under the Austrian Presidency.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 46 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of requests and inquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel to Irish born people living outside Ireland, particularly in the UK. This issue has now been examined in considerable detail. While the legal advice available to me is that such a proposal would be contrary to the EC treaty, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality, I have continued to explore all options with a view to making progress.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the introduction of a European wide travel pass, as far as I am aware, there are no proposals being worked on at EU level in relation to a common travel framework. Any such proposals would have significant financial and administrative implications and, in the light of the variety of arrangements which currently apply, there would be major practical problems in implementing arrangements of this kind.</P>
        <P>The issue of a senior euro pass card, which would entitle older people to concessions on various services including travel, cultural and social activities, was raised in a report commissioned by the EU Commission some years ago but no proposals in this regard were brought forward subsequently.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 90 and 99 together.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction contained in the rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</P>
        <P>From 5 May 2005, the one parent family payment and orphan&rsquo;s non-contributory pension schemes were classified as family benefits under EU law &mdash; Regulations 1408/71. In effect this means that the habitual residence condition is no longer applied to claims for these schemes made by EEA workers who are employed or self-employed in the State and subject to Irish PRSI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The operation of the habitual residence condition has been monitored constantly by my Department since its introduction. A comprehensive review of the operation of the condition is being carried out with a view to assessing its impact on different categories of persons claiming social assistance-child benefit and supplementary welfare allowance payments; assessing the current organisational arrangements in the Department for administering the condition and the service provided to customers; identifying opportunities for improvements to the administration of the scheme, including those aspects involving other Departments; examining all aspects of the decision making process; and identifying emerging policy issues and considering how they should be addressed.</P>
        <P>Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations which have an interest in the area. I have no plans to abolish the habitual residence condition at this time.</P>

        <P>Effective cross-departmental co-operation is necessary for the achievement of many of the goals, objectives and strategies identified in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2005-2007, Security with Opportunity. In some cases, such as the national anti-poverty strategy or the <Col N="928"/>REACH project, my Department has the central co-ordinating role. In other cases, my Department co-operates with other Departments to ensure that overall cross-departmental policies such as the employment action plan or the national children&rsquo;s strategy are delivered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A comprehensive list of cross-departmental areas in which my Department is involved is contained in the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2005-2007, which was circulated to Deputies in August 2005. Details of some of the key areas of involvement are as follows: National Anti Poverty Strategy: The Office for Social Inclusion, OSI, which is based in my Department, has overall responsibility for co-ordinating and driving implementation of the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, NAP/inclusion. The plan details the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to tackling poverty and exclusion and builds on the original national anti-poverty strategy, which was introduced in 1997. It includes a large number of targets and commitments across a range of areas of Government policies. The office, in its role of co-ordinating the NAP/inclusion process, maintains regular contact with relevant Departments in order to ensure an integrated &lsquo;joined up&rsquo; approach to tackling poverty and exclusion. The office also monitors progress in relation to the targets contained in the plan and seeks to identify areas where further action is required. The work of the office is overseen by a management group of Assistant Secretaries drawn from relevant Departments. These Departments are also represented on the senior officials group on social inclusion which maintains a broad overview of social inclusion issues and prepares the agenda of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach. More regular contacts between the OSI and Departments are managed through a network of social inclusion liaison officers who are located in all relevant Departments. The office provides supports to these officers in monitoring implementation of the NAP/inclusion in their individual Departments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department liaises with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in a number of areas and through various fora. These include Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European employment strategy, which is co-ordinated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Under this initiative, the national employment action plan, NEAP, is administered. This is my Department&rsquo;s principal intervention measure to support and encourage unemployed people to progress towards employment. Under this process, unemployment payment recipients are referred to F&Aacute;S for assessment as to the progression path most suited to their individual needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Review of obstacles to employment faced by lone parents: Addressing the obstacles to employment faced by lone parents is one of the <Col N="929"/>key tasks in the Ending Child Poverty initiatives under Sustaining Progress. A subgroup of the senior officials group on social inclusion has been examining this issue. The subgroup is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and includes representatives from my Department. My Department also provides the secretariat for this group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department also has regular liaison with the Department of Education and Science regarding the back to education allowance and with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to the rural social scheme. At regional and local level, officials of my Department are involved in the RAPID programme and on county development boards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is represented on a number of interdepartmental working groups in relation to the implementation of new rental assistance arrangements agreed by Government in July 2004. These include a project steering group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Finance and local authority managers, to lead the project and a national advisory group, including representatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the housing unit, local authorities, the social partners, including SIPTU and IMPACT, landlord and tenant bodies and voluntary-co-operative groups, to provide input to the steering group. A project implementation group is also in place, with overall responsibility for general implementation and co-ordination of activities countrywide. This group meets on a monthly basis. The group comprises of the local authority project managers and representatives from my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department also participates in the cross-departmental team on homelessness and the Housing Forum. Both of these are chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is committed to work with the Department of Health and Children, via the National Children&rsquo;s Office, to develop the national longitudinal study of children in Ireland. This study is the most significant of its kind to be undertaken in Ireland. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study. The aim of the study is to examine the factors which contribute to, or undermine, the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families and, through this, contribute to the setting of effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and their families. My Department is co-funding this study with the Department of Health and Children and the project team, which will provide operational <Col N="930"/>oversight of the project, includes officials from both Departments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is also working closely with the Department of Health and Children in the area of long-term care. I have mentioned in the House before that a long-term care working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my Department, is due to report to the T&aacute;naiste and to me shortly. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the Review of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A cross-departmental agency under the aegis of my Department was established by the Government in 1999 to build or procure the public services broker, a single multi-channel gateway to Government, and to develop a framework for the integration of public services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is also taking a lead role on the interdepartmental steering group for the development of the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, SAFE. This programme of work will further build on public services identity services to provide the basis for a consistent set of registration and authentication services for customer interaction with public services. The output of this programme will, <i>inter alia</i>, form the basis for the delivery of on-line services by the forthcoming public service broker being developed by the Reach agency.</P>
        <P>On a day-to-day level, there is considerable co-operation regarding the use of the PPS number. For example, my Department receives all life event data automatically from the General Register Office in the Department of Health and Children, and co-operates with a number of Departments in relation to the validation of PPS numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is involved in a number of cross-departmental initiatives related to people with disabilities. Prior to the enactment of the Disability Act 2005, a senior officials group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, was convened. This oversaw the preparation of the national disability strategy and reported to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, CCSI. This group has been reconvened to monitor progress on implementation of the strategy, the Disability Act and Comhairle (Amendment) Bill and accordingly reports to the CCSI. My Department is represented on the group which also includes representation from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Science, Enterprise Trade and Employment, Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P><Col N="931"/>
        <P Just="Left">My Department also participates in the inter-departmental working group on the feasibility of costs of disability payment and in an interdepartmental committee which is examining the issues arising on the future delivery of training, work and employment services for people with disabilities. Both of these are chaired by the Department of Health and Children. Treatment Benefits: A management review group involving my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance, health services management including principal dental surgeons, the Primary Care Reimbursement Services, GMS, and the HSEA also exists. The group is facilitating conjoint probity work between the two Departments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is also represented on the national framework committee for work-life balance policies. Chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, this group, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and continued under Sustaining Progress, is charged with supporting and facilitating the development of work-life balance policies at the level of the enterprise through the development of a package of practical measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is represented on a High Level Group on Travellers which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group&rsquo;s remit is to ensure that the relevant statutory agencies involved in providing the full range of services to travellers focus on the integrated practical delivery of such services. The Department is also involved in a number of local initiatives concerning services for Travellers.</P>
        <P>My Department has also participated in the examination by Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the draft UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department works closely with the Department of Finance in progressing a range of reviews under the expenditure review initiative, ERI. The ERI was launched in 1997 to provide a systematic analysis of what is being achieved by expenditure in each programme, a basis on which informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes and a systematic and evidence based approach to policy making. My Department is currently engaged in a review of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme and in the review of the application of the conditions of the unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance schemes, UB-UA, to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 34 and 79 together.</P>
        <P>Diet supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Any person who is receiving a social welfare or health service executive payment, who has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and who is unable to provide for his or her food needs from within his or her own resources, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Diet supplements are subject to a means test. Under the existing scheme. the amount of supplement payable in individual cases depends on which of two categories of diet &mdash; low cost or high cost &mdash; has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical adviser, and the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2004 the diet supplement scheme was restructured to take account of increases in both social welfare payment rates and the rate of food inflation. In the case of new applicants for diet supplement the amount of supplement payable is based on increased up-to-date diet costs, &euro;44 for lower cost diets or &euro;57 for higher cost diets, less one third of the applicant&rsquo;s income or one sixth of the joint income in the case of a couple.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P Just="Left">As increases in the social welfare payment rates were higher than food price inflation since 1996, the shortfall to be met by the diet supplement is less than it was in the past. However, as a special arrangement, people who were in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations on 1 January 2004 continue to receive their existing rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in their circumstances that would warrant a review of their cases. Pending any further changes, similar arrangements continue to apply this year for existing and new cases, taking account of 2005 rates of social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>In order to inform a re-appraisal of the scheme, my Department commissioned a study by an expert from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. The study examined the special diets prescribed in legislation for which assistance is available through the existing diet supplement scheme. The study also considered the appropriate level of assistance required to cater for any additional costs involved in providing for necessary special diets, relative to the cost of a normal healthy eating diet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The findings of this research study have been assessed by my Department to determine how the diet supplement scheme should be enhanced to best effect. Development of a new scheme is complex, as the expert advice is that certain diet conditions covered under the existing scheme should be adjusted quite significantly in the light of the latest medical thinking on nutrition. The institute also investigated the costs of its recommended special diets and compared those with the cost of a normal healthy eating diet, to advise me on the scale of supplements that might be needed. The Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, which carried out the original study, will be formally presenting its report to me shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In finalising a revised scheme and regulations, I want to make sure that any new supplement coverage and payment rates put in place continue to enable people on low incomes to meet the identified extra cost of medically recommended special diets if they need them. In the meantime, diet supplements continue to be provided for existing recipients and new applicants heretofore.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is pursuing a modern<Col N="934"/>isation programme which aims to build on the quality service it provides at present and to ensure an excellent service is maintained into the future. The establishment of a separate agency to administer and deliver social welfare payments is one of a number of options that are under consideration as part of the public service modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The concept of a separate agency for the delivery of social welfare services is not new. A number of countries such as New Zealand and Australia have followed the route of setting up separate executive agencies to deliver some of its services.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Benefits Agency which was set up in the UK as an executive agency within the Department of Social Security. The Benefits Agency was replaced by Jobcentre Plus in April 2002 and it currently operates under the aegis of the Department for Work and Pensions. The administration of state pensions in the UK is the responsibility of the Pension Service, which is also an executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions.</P>
        <P>My Department has been structured on Aireacht-Executive lines since the mid-1980s. The Aireacht is responsible for researching and formulating social welfare policy. It also provides a range of corporate services including personnel and finance.</P>
        <P>Social Welfare Services is the executive arm of the Department and is responsible for the administration and management of social welfare schemes and services through a network of local, regional and decentralised offices.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently embarking on a significant programme of change under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation initiative and is extremely conscious of the need to carefully manage change so as to ensure that the service it provides to its customers is not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>The proposal for a separate social welfare agency is at the embryonic stage and will need to be examined in detail before consideration could be given to its feasibility. Assessments must be made regarding potential improvements in services and the economies or efficiencies that might accrue from such an approach. Issues such as legal, operational, personnel and industrial relations matters will also have to be addressed.</P>
        <P>My Department will have the opportunity of examining the experiences of countries which have already pursued this approach and it will be in a position to take on board the lessons from those countries in order to avoid any difficulties which could arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Setting up an executive agency to deliver social welfare services will require a major change and a comprehensive examination of all the issues involved and this will be carried out before detailed proposals drawn up. Overall, I consider there is considerable merit in moving the administration of payments to a stand-alone agency and <Col N="935"/>in allowing the Department to focus more on social policy issues behind the welfare payments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 63 together.</P>
        <P>I have received representations from a number of organisations including the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning the exploitation of migrant workers. The position is that migrant workers qualify for social insurance benefits in respect of the unexpired part of their work permits if they satisfy the normal qualifying conditions. The habitual residence condition does not apply in these cases. Migrant workers may also satisfy the habitual residence condition for receipt of social assistance payments and child benefit. I am keeping this matter under review and, if necessary, I will take action to ensure that migrant workers are not exploited because of the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>I have no evidence to suggest that the habitual residence condition is a factor in the decision of Irish Ferries to make its existing staff redundant and recruit new staff under less favourable wage rates and conditions of employment.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction contained in the rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines <Col N="936"/>to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 36, 52, 74, 89, 146 and 147 together.</P>
        <P>Fuel allowances are a supplementary entitlement payable over the winter heating season to eligible people in receipt of pensions and other qualifying social welfare schemes. Some 274,000 people receive this allowance, at an aggregate cost of &euro;85.4 million this year.</P>
        <P>In addition to the fuel allowance, over 320,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of &euro;109 million in 2005. As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption in order that these people are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</P>
        <P>Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment and are not intended to meet heating costs in full. The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the recipient&rsquo;s total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all their income needs, including heating costs. Budget resources have been concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances because the increase is paid for the full year and not just for the 29 weeks of the winter heating season. This approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>I acknowledge that some fuel costs have increased significantly over the past year in particular. However, overall inflation, including fuel price inflation, has amounted to 12.8% since January 2002 when the value of fuel allowance was last increased. Weekly social welfare rates incorporating fuel allowance have increased cumulatively by between 33% and 37% in that period. The household benefits allowances have also been increased fully in line with electricity and gas prices in the period and are payable all year round to assist eligible pensioners, carers and disabled people with their heating costs.</P>
        <P>In relation to practical difficulties in heating homes, I believe this is mainly caused by energy inefficiency in the houses arising from inadequate heating systems, draughts and poor insulation. This is typically the situation with older private dwellings, as more modern private and local authority housing is built to regulated standards of energy efficiency. I recognise that someone on a low income has very limited scope <Col N="938"/>to spend money to correct these structural problems.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>As a start in addressing this broader issue, my Department is co-operating with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Combat Poverty Agency in an action research project to improve heating systems and insulation in pilot selected older private dwellings in Cork and Donegal, and to monitor the outcomes for the households in terms of improved cost efficiency and comfort and health levels. This project is due to commence shortly and should be very informative in formulating future policy on this issue, as well as being of more immediate direct benefit to the pilot households involved.</P>
        <P>In relation to income support, I am keeping the adequacy of the overall system, including the fuel allowance scheme, under close review. Increases in basic payment rates or in the rate or duration of the fuel allowance have significant cost implications. For example, an increase in basic rates of &euro;1 per week would cost &euro;52 million per annum. Increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;1 per week &mdash; an 11% increase &mdash; would cost &euro;8 million per annum. Increasing the duration of the fuel allowance by one week would cost just under &euro;3 million per annum. Given these significant potential extra scheme costs, any increases in fuel allowance rates or duration are matters to be considered in the context of general increases in the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>It is Government policy to encourage people to participate in supplementary pension arrangements so that they can, when they retire, maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. To this end, a range of measures has been introduced in recent years including personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, mandatory employer PRSA access where occupational schemes are not available, and an ongoing national pensions awareness campaign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of overall occupational and private pensions coverage, CSO figures for the first quarter of 2004 indicate that 52.4% of persons in employment have a supplementary pension. Out of a national workforce of some 2 million people, an estimated 900,000 people do not have a supplementary pension to increase their incomes in retirement.</P><Col N="939"/>
        <P>The key target group for Government action in the supplementary pensions area is those who are 30 years of age and over. The national pensions policy initiative suggested that up to 70% of this group will need to supplement their social welfare pension to maintain living standards in retirement. The most recent CSO figures suggest that 59.1% of people in this group have supplementary coverage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that progress in relation to pensions coverage is being made as, in recent years, there has been a steady increase in the number of people taking out PRSAs and in those participating in occupational schemes. The most recent figures from the Pensions Board show that 59,251 PRSAs had been taken out up to the end of September 2005. However, overall pensions coverage is increasing at a lower rate than is desirable. The reasons for this are many and varied and include, for instance, issues of affordability and the fact that many people consider they are too young to consider pension provision.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in February of this year, because of slow progress on our pensions targets, I asked the Pensions Board to conduct a review of our overall pensions strategy. I received its report on 7 November.</P>
        <P>The review encompasses an examination of the main strategic recommendations contained in the national pensions policy initiative including those relating to the adequacy of income in retirement, coverage targets, levels of social welfare pensions, sustainability of State pensions including public sector pensions, and the tax support for supplementary pensions. The review also examines the question of alternative ways of addressing pensions adequacy and coverage issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review has been submitted to the Cabinet for consideration. The report is a large and complex document that will need to be fully studied by my colleagues. When this has been finalised, arrangements for publicising the report will be decided on. I hope the report will engender a national debate on the future direction of our pensions system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In July 2000, Government approved proposals by the Department for a service delivery modernisation programme or SDM. The SDM is a multi-annual programme of work involving the introduction of new technology and the replacement of legacy computer systems. It also involves the redesign of back office systems.</P><Col N="941"/>
        <P>The SDM programme is being implemented in a number of self-contained projects spanning several years. Each project has two strands, one focused on developing the ICT system components and the other on implementing a parallel programme of organisational change. The purpose of the organisational change programme is to redesign work processes and organisational structures with a view to implementing modern work practices which, supported by a flexible technical architecture, will allow the Department to respond to change and to deliver a high quality, personalised and integrated service to customers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first phase of this programme, which focused on the child benefit scheme,  commenced in 2001 and was successfully implemented in November 2002. This phase gained international recognition for its improvements in service delivery. The current phase of the SDM programme commenced on 31 May 2004 and covers the extension of the programme to retirement and old age contributory pension, household benefits-free travel and bereavement grant. The new system will facilitate the proactive initiation of pension claims, make it easier for customers to transact their business with the Department and will provide additional support for staff in carrying out their duties.</P>
        <P>The first release of this current phase of the SDM programme went live on 1 October 2005. This involved the implementation of the contribution history object or CHO. The CHO facilitates the electronic consolidation of a customer&rsquo;s full insurance record. This will result in an improvement in customer service as more complete contribution records, on which their entitlement to contributory payment rely, will be more easily accessible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A provision of &euro;4.5 million has been provided in the Estimates for 2006 to complete the development of the current phase of the SDM programme which is due for full implementation by the end of 2006. The SDM programme is a major undertaking which aims to introduce modern ICT systems and work practices to allow the Department to respond more rapidly to strategic changes and to deliver a high quality service to its customers. I am satisfied that the new system will deliver tangible benefits for customers and will be more efficient in terms of accuracy and time taken to deal with the processing of claims.</P>

	<P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. A range of proposals has been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.</P>
        <P>In general, widows and widowers under 66 years of age do not benefit from the household benefits scheme. Their rates of payment are similar to social welfare beneficiaries in a similar position and, accordingly, it would be difficult to justify specific payments in their case to compensate for the fact that they are not eligible benefits. That said, widows and widowers with dependent children can benefit from the widowed parent grant, introduced in 2000, to provide additional assistance following a bereavement. The grant is currently valued at &euro;2,700 and is paid in addition to the usual after death payments.</P>
        <P>Increases in the rates of child benefit are also of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased significantly; by 271% at the lower rate and 258% at the higher rate, compared with inflation of 30.6%. The current rates of child benefit are &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first and second children and &euro;177.30 per month for the third and subsequent children. Increases in payment supports for widows and widowers have more than covered increases in living costs in recent years. I am continuing to look for opportunities to improve their position and, in this regard, the various provisions for widows and widowers under the social welfare code will be kept under review in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

        <Quest>why, in view of the social policy reform agenda in which his Department is committed to assisting those dependent on social welfare to return to education and employment, the employment support services section of his Department which deals with the back to work allowance and back to education allowance, shows a 1% reduction in estimated costs for 2006; <Col N="943"/>and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>My Department assists and encourages the unemployed and other welfare recipients, including lone parents and people with disabilities, to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures. One such measure is the back to work allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages people to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment. Another measure is the back to education allowance scheme which provides support to social welfare recipients who need to obtain educational qualifications before re-entering the labour force.</P>
        <P>The recently published 2006 abridged Estimates, as is usual, made no provision for changes in eligibility, entitlements or rates of payment for any of the schemes administered by my Department. Improvements across the range of the schemes are being considered at present in the context of next week&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 1% reduction in the estimated cost of the employment support services of my Department in the 2006 abridged Estimates is due to provision for a decrease of 1,600 in the average number of participants on the back to work allowance scheme partially offset by provision for an increase of 1,100 in the average number of participants on the back to education allowance scheme. The predicted decrease in back to work allowance participants in 2006 reflects the fact that numbers on the scheme have been declining over recent years. The scheme reached its peak in October 2000 when there were 39,343 participants. The number of participants currently stands at 9,244. The 2006 Estimate assumes the participation level will fall further to about 8,500 by the middle of next year. Since its introduction in September 1993 the scheme has assisted over 110,000 people to take up self-employment and employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The predicted increase in back to education allowance participants in 2006 reflects the fact that numbers on the scheme have been growing over recent years. Additionally, I significantly relaxed the qualifying rules for the scheme in September of this year. The main changes I made involved reductions in the length of time persons must be in receipt of social welfare payments before qualifying for third level education under the scheme. There were 7,308 back to education participants in the 2004-05 academic year, of which 3,023 were pursuing second level qualifications and 4,285 were pursuing third level qualifications. The 2006 Estimate assumes the participation level will increase to 8,500 by the start of the 2006-07 academic year. Since the scheme was first introduced in 1990 it is estimated that more than 12,000 participants have gained third level <Col N="944"/>qualifications with its support. As I have already said, improvements to these and other schemes administered by my Department are being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The increase of &euro;6.85 million to which the Deputy refers is related to an increase in the A5 estimates sub-head in the Abridged Estimates Volume or AEV. This provides for the purchase, rental and maintenance of computer equipment and related items, photocopying equipment, other office machinery, printing, binding and stationery services. The major ICT infrastructure projects planned for my Department are as follows.  The desktop upgrade project involves the replacement of all remaining visual display units &mdash; VDUs or &ldquo;dumb terminals&rdquo; with PCs in all my Department&rsquo;s offices nationwide. The Department will then have a standard, centrally managed, desktop configuration for each staff member. This will provide for easier deployment of modern applications to staff. It will also simplify support and training and more efficient use of network facilities.  In order to ensure the business continuity, supports the continued development of business processes and provides for the desktop upgrade referred to, it is necessary to replace the equipment which provides and supports the Department&rsquo;s national communications network. The equipment must support the latest security standards and also cater for situations where different types of network traffic require different types of handling such as voice traffic needing prioritisation so as to ensure good quality when travelling through a busy data network.  My Department has a number of nationwide administrative regions and headquarter buildings. IP conferencing facilities provide for collaboration and communication through voice, video and document sharing. It is planned to pilot and deploy conferencing facilities both to the desktop and in conference rooms. My Department must migrate to a LAN telephony solution in order to have in place a more flexible, feature-rich, cost-effective and easier-to-manage telephony environment that converges with the data network. This project will put in place facilities to support mobility of staff. For example, staff will be able to operate out of more than one location, yet still be contactable via extension number. It will enable computer telephony integration on future application such as business object model releases and will lead to reduced call charges by carrying more voice traffic on our data network; and computer <Col N="945"/>storage backup solution: computer storage backup is critical to the continuity of our main production and payment systems. The existing backup solution for my Department&rsquo;s data centre has been in place for some time and is in need of replacement on age and capability grounds. The new backup solution to be put in place will overcome existing shortcomings and provide a solution for the longer term.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides for payments due to qualified adults to be paid separately in certain circumstances, for example, in case of domestic difficulty where a spouse might otherwise have no other form of income. Also for certain categories of old age non-contributory pension, where the couple are both aged 66 or over, payment is made individually to each partner.</P>
        <P>Over the years various groups and reports have recommended that individualised payments for all qualified adults be progressed within the social welfare codes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2003 The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland produced a report, A Woman&rsquo;s Model for Social Welfare Reform, in which it clearly indicated its desire for a move away from the current qualified adult allowance to a full direct adult payment, and during my meeting with this group in April last it again reiterated its position on this matter.</P>
        <P>The question of personal payments was considered by a working group in 1999 which examined the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. A working group chaired by my Department was established in 2002 in response to submissions from the trade unions and the voluntary and social partners in negotiations for the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The group&rsquo;s recommendations included proposals for the implementation of a system of personal payments which would involve the payment of the qualified adult allowance directly to a spouse, on a consensual basis, with both parties agreeing to the splitting of the personal and qualified adult <Col N="946"/>rates. The group envisaged a phased implementation of this arrangement.</P>
        <P>In October 2002, my Department introduced administrative arrangements to provide an option to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to the spouse for all new applicants to retirement and old age contributory pension, OACP-RP. These arrangements continue to apply in the case of old age contributory and retirement pensions and to date some 1,101 couples have indicated their preference to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to the spouse. This represents about 6.75% of approximately 16,300 OACP-RP pensions awarded with a qualified adult allowance since October 2002.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the desire of certain sectors of the community to have mandatory personal payments implemented. I am also conscious of the need to take account of the views of our customers regarding this matter. Furthermore, there is a number of administrative and legislative issues that requires further examination before extending or modifying these arrangements. These issues are under active consideration by my Department and I hope to progress the matter in the coming year.</P>

	<P>My Department assists and encourages lone parents to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service. One significant measure is the back to work allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages people to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment. Research has shown that 75% of participants remain in employment or self-employment following participation.</P>
        <P>Another measure offered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service is the back to education allowance programme which provides support to long-term social welfare recipients who need to obtain educational qualifications before re-entering the labour force. Again, information provided through research has shown that in the case of a control group surveyed, 63% were <Col N="947"/>in employment following participation in the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, a special projects fund administered by my Department&rsquo;s locally based facilitators provides enhanced support to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment. The facilitators also operate small-scale family services projects in certain areas, which are designed to focus supports towards specific target groups with complex needs. The provision of this additional support involves individual attention, customised information and enhanced access to services. It can increase the capacity of those in the most difficult circumstances, to improve their self-esteem and personal situations through access to basic education, training and developmental opportunities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is hoped that by encouraging customers to participate in self-development programmes and in some instances &ldquo;taster&rdquo; educational programmes that they will move on to more formalised training and educational programmes.</P>
        <P>The special projects and family services initiatives are based on the application of a partnership approach between my Department, the voluntary and community sector, the private sector and other local players in identifying and addressing local needs in terms of training and development for people dependent on social welfare payments including lone parents. So far this year &euro;1.8 million has been accessed through the special projects fund and &euro;1.6 million from the family services project to support these initiatives.</P>
        <P>With regard to employment, lone parents may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Above that level, half of any earnings are assessed, up to a maximum of &euro;293.00 per week. From 6 January 2005 recipients whose earnings have now increased and are in excess of &euro;293.00 per week may be entitled to half of their one-parent family payment for a maximum of 26 weeks, starting immediately after their earnings exceeded &euro;293.00 per week. When the 26 week period expires the payment then ceases.</P>
        <P>As I have publicly stated on several occasions, I examining broader social policy reforms that will be directed at the breaking down of existing obstacles to employment, increasing access to career enhancing education and training opportunities and the transforming of lives through targeted supports and more enlightened social policies that put the welfare and the future of the child, or children, at the very centre. Work on these proposals are proceeding and I hope to report on progress in the near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 92 and 93 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the recent report on the accessibility and fairness of the social welfare appeals system and I commend the Northside Community Law Centre for its role in commissioning it. The centre is funded by my Department and earlier this year I approved substantial additional funding for it so that it can continue its role in delivering a comprehensive and cost-effective legal advice service for our citizens. Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to social welfare payment made by a deciding officer of my Department or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowance has a statutory right to appeal the decision. Their independence was underpinned by the establishment of the social welfare appeals office in 1990, since when it has operated independently of my Department. Appeals officers have always been independent in the exercise of their functions and this has been recognised and commented on by the courts. The appeals office dealt with more than 14,000 appealed decisions in 2004 with over 46% having outcomes favourable to appellants.</P>
        <P>When the office was established it was not considered necessary to place it on a statutory footing. Various legislative changes, however were made to enhance the independence of the system. Functions such as receiving appeals, appointing assessors, notifying decisions, referral of cases to the High Court which hitherto had been those of the Minister were transferred to the chief appeals officer. The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant&rsquo;s case gets full and fair consideration. The system is accessible and informal which gives it significant advantages in terms of providing the best possible services for social welfare customers.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>The report highlights the need for a fair and impartial appeals system for appellants as regards their social welfare entitlements and raises a number of issues in relation to the effectiveness of the current service. However, several of the report&rsquo;s recommendations have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented, mainly arising from of a major review of the social welfare appeals office which was completed in 2002.</P>
        <P>The perception of the independence of the appeals office is a recurring theme in the report. While a minority of respondents expressed concern on this aspect, it is not clear that many of the appellants or agencies regarded it as a priority issue. Among those respondents who were successful in their appeals, some 85% considered the appeal system to be fair and 74% thought it easy to use.</P>
        <P>There are a number of positive findings in this report which reflects credit on the appeals office. The voluntary and community organisations surveyed during the study considered that the appeals officers acted in a fair and impartial manner and put people at ease during appeal hearings which for many people could be stressful events. In addition, some 94% of survey respondents felt they had been given an opportunity to put their case and respond to issues raised during their appeal hearing.</P>
        <P>While this report makes a positive contribution to the future planning and development of the social welfare appeals system, I am satisfied that the present system is working effectively and is providing a service to a high standard. No further legislative changes are proposed at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 78 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reduction and eventual elimination of child poverty are at the core of the strategic process to combat poverty and social exclusion, a priority shared internationally. The OECD in a report to social affairs ministers in April of this year pointed out that &ldquo;children who grow up in disadvantaged households are more likely to do poorly at school, to struggle to find a job, and to be unemployed, sick or disabled when they become adults, precipitating an inter generational cycle of disadvantage and deprivation&rdquo;.</P><Col N="950"/>
        <P>A strategic process for combating and eventually eliminating child poverty, together with specific measures to meet the objectives of the process, is already in train under the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and the national children&rsquo;s strategy. Ending Child Poverty is also one of ten special initiatives in Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>The most significant measure my Department has taken in recent years to support families with children has been the very substantial real increases in child benefit payment rates. Between 1997 and 2005, the rate of child benefit rose from &euro;38.09 per month for the first two children and &euro;49.52 for each child thereafter to &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. This equates to real increases over the period in excess of 170%. Child benefit is paid to over 540,000 families in respect of approximately 1 million children, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.9 billion in 2005.</P>
        <P>Through the family income supplement scheme, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay. Recent improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for more lower-income households to qualify under the scheme. Child dependant allowances are also paid to recipients of weekly social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Most children at risk of poverty live in jobless households, where there is no full-time or part-time employment. The major increase over the past decade in employment, including the increased participation of women in employment, has made a significant contribution to reducing the risk of poverty for children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of affordable and flexible child care is a key factor in facilitating employment participation for families with children. My Department is participating in an interdepartmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A subgroup of the senior officials group on social inclusion has been undertaking a detailed examination of obstacles to employment for lone parents. As part of this work, my Department is nearing the completion of a review of income supports which I expect to be finalised in the near future. I expect shortly to receive proposals from the National Economic and Social Council on the structures needed to introduce a second tier of financial supports, in addition to child benefit and other entitlements, aimed specifically at helping those children most in need.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P>Given the central importance of combating child poverty, the extensive range of policies required and the resources involved, we need to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of the these policies on the development of our children and get the necessary evidence on what works and works well. This process is about to commence with a major national longitudinal study on children. My Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the National Children&rsquo;s Office, are jointly funding this study. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study.</P>
        <P>I am confident that, through the measures already being taken and the initiatives being planned, we will make a decisive impact of combating poverty, especially among children, and in ensuring that all the nation&rsquo;s children have a good quality of life and a fair share of life. These policy areas also form key elements of Government actions relating to children and families&rsquo; chances.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 65 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The number of one-parent family recipients being paid by my Department at the end of September 2005 is 79,937, the latest date for which figures are available. Included in this figure are 906 widowed persons. It is not possible to get exact statistics on the number of one parent family payment recipients for whom social welfare payments are their sole income. However, previous research in this area would indicate that 60% of one-parent family recipients overall are currently in full or part-time employment. Lone parents are encouraged to maximise their income from different sources and the means test for this scheme makes provision for the exemption of significant levels of earnings and maintenance payments.</P><Col N="952"/>
        <P>With regard to employment, lone parents may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Above that level, half of any earnings are assessed, up to a maximum of &euro;293.00 per week. Lone parents may also be eligible to avail of the full range of employment support services operated by the Department.</P>
        <P>Lone parents are also encouraged to pursue the question of maintenance payments with the other parent. This is achieved by ensuring that there is a clear benefit to lone parents and their children arising from any maintenance payments secured. At present up to 50% of maintenance received may be disregarded under the means test and, in addition, allowances are made for up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance paid in respect of mortgage or rent.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s records indicate that approximately 9,600 one-parent family payment recipients are in receipt of maintenance from their spouse or the other parent of their children. However, many other recipients could be in receipt of maintenance and still qualify for the maximum rate of one parent family payment as a result of the provision allowing one-parent family payment claimants to retain 50% of any maintenance received.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no loss of income incurred by one-parent family payment recipients where the Department has to pursue the issue of maintenance with the non-resident parent. Rather, the provision allowing one-parent family payment claimants to retain 50% of any direct maintenance received was established as an incentive to lone parents to seek agreement with the other parent on the level of maintenance to be paid. While there are no plans at present to change this approach it will be the subject of consideration as part of a review of supports to single parents.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent figures from the EU showing that Ireland spent just 16% of its GDP on social benefits compared to an EU average of 27.7%; his plans to increase social spending towards the EU average; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU. This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes and other social inclusion programmes. The latest such statistics were <Col N="953"/>released on 20 October 2005 and deal with developments up to and including 2002. No comparable figures are yet available for 2003 or 2004.</P>
        <P>When examining such data it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments. For example, tax relief on contributions towards occupational and private pensions, which are an important feature of Ireland&rsquo;s pension system, is not counted as expenditure. The EUROSTAT release draws attention to the fact the EU average masks major national differences in the structure of social protection funding, partly related to differing levels of wealth between countries, and also reflect differences in social protection systems, demographic trends, unemployment rates and other social, institutional and economic factors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Ireland, currently with the youngest population in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and health care and care of the elderly than most other member states. In 2002, social protection expenditure accounted for 27.7% of GDP in the EU 25 countries, compared to 27.3% in 2001. The corresponding ratio for Ireland was 16% compared to 15.3% in 2001.</P>
        <P>Social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is crucially dependent on the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment. The statistics show that for the EU 15 countries, social protection expenditure relative to GDP had fallen from its maximum share of 28.7% in 1993 until 1999, when it accounted for 27.3%. This was due to renewed GDP growth and slower growth in social protection expenditure, particularly related to unemployment benefits. Ireland&rsquo;s position mirrored that of the EU 15, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries and consequently the drop in the percentage of GDP accounted for by social protection expenditure was greater, from 20.2% in 1993 to 14.7% in 1999.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under this Government there has been a sustained and substantial increase in social protection expenditure. The EUROSTAT report states that the increase in Ireland&rsquo;s <i>per capita</i> expenditure from 1998 to 2002, 8.7% per annum on average and the highest of all EU countries, in comparison to that of the EU as a whole, 2.5% per annum was &ldquo;particularly pronounced&rdquo;. Moreover, it should be noted that social welfare expenditure will have increased substantially during the three-year period 2002 to 2005, an overall increase of 28%, well ahead of the corresponding projected increases in prices and earnings.</P>
        <P>As recently announced in the Estimates, overall spending on social welfare will increase next year to a total of &euro;12.49 billion, an increase of <Col N="954"/>over &euro;200 million from the 2005 figure, even before announcements in the 2006 budget are taken into account. This Government will continue to address the scope for further improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s social protection infrastructure, guided by the national anti-poverty strategy, while at the same time continuing to take the measures necessary to maintain economic growth and competitiveness and thereby generate the resources for further social investment.</P>

	<P>The role of my Department in the area of supporting Irish emigrants has been built around providing good quality, clear and comprehensive information. It is essential that Irish emigrants, who are considering returning to Ireland to live, have up-to-date information available to them. My Department carries out this function by <Col N="955"/>supporting the various voluntary agencies involved in this work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently my Department funded Emigrant Advice, the main voluntary organisation involved in information provision to emigrants, to publish a comprehensive information guide for returning Irish emigrants. This guide, entitled Returning to Ireland, contains information on a wide range of topics including social welfare, health, pensions, taxation, education and accommodation and sets out clearly the benefits and costs associated with returning to Ireland to live. The information is presented in a way that is tailored to the needs of targeted groups of people, for instance, the elderly coming home to retire, single people returning to Ireland to find work, and the needs of families hoping to start a new life in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In partnership with Emigrant Advice and the Department of Foreign Affairs, my Department has ensured that this guide has been widely distributed. Copies have been posted to all our Irish immigrant centres abroad and to all Irish embassies and consulates. It has also been widely distributed to organisations in Ireland such as citizen information centres, F&Aacute;S offices, and social welfare local offices.</P>
        <P>It is important that returning emigrants realise there are costs as well as benefits involved in deciding to come back to Ireland. On my recent visit to the Irish Centre in Camden Town, London, to launch the guide Returning to Ireland, I highlighted these matters so that people considering returning to live in Ireland can make informed decisions. This advice along with the publication and widespread distribution of comprehensive information such as the Returning to Ireland guide is an important step in insuring that returning emigrants are alerted to all the implications when making their decision to return to Ireland to live.</P>

        <P FLI="0">PRSI exemptions are issued in accordance with Article 97 of SI 312/1996. The legislation provides for an exemption from PRSI contributions for up to 52 weeks to be granted to employees not ordinarily resident in the State but who are temporarily employed here. The purpose of the legislation is to avoid a situation whereby workers who are sent by their employer to work here temporarily would be subject to social insurance in two countries at the same time. Similar arrangements apply under EU legislation to workers moving within the EU-EEA and to workers covered by bilateral social security agreements with this country.</P>
        <P>When a request for an exemption certificate is being processed, a signed declaration is obtained from each employer confirming that the person for whom the exemption certificate is being sought has been retained in the social insurance regime of his or her home country while working in Ireland. That is intended to confirm that the employee is being posted and is covered for social insurance in his or her home country while covered by an exemption certificate.</P>
        <P>In randomly selected cases, independent confirmation is sought from the authorities in the employee&rsquo;s home country that social insurance payments have actually been made during the period covered by the exemption certificate. That control complements the employer&rsquo;s declaration that the employee has been retained in insurance cover in his or her own country.</P>
        <P>In the case of the company in question, a random sample of exempted cases has been referred to the relevant overseas authorities, via the Department of Foreign Affairs, and confirmation has been received that the employees involved remained attached to their home country&rsquo;s social security regime during the period of the exemption.</P>
        <P>Granting of an exemption certificate is also linked to the existence of a valid work permit which confirms that the employee is not ordinarily resident in this State and is entitled to work here.</P>
        <P>The needs of the Irish economy have changed significantly since the PRSI exemption legislation was introduced in 1961. There have been changes in working patterns and skill levels, and the <Col N="957"/>enlargement of the European Union has also affected the labour market. Against that background, and having regard to the circumstances of the case in question, my Department is undertaking a review of the policy and legislative provisions and the administrative arrangements for the PRSI exemption scheme. It is my intention to consider any necessary measures for change in the light of the review.</P>

	<P>The Estimates for my Department, as set out in the recently published 2006 Abridged Estimates Volume, provide for spending on social welfare totalling &euro;12.49 billion. Those Estimates make no provision for changes in eligibility, entitlements or rates of payment for any of the underlying programmes, which are matters for the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>Even before announcements in next week&rsquo;s budget are taken into account, the provision of &euro;12.49 billion in 2006 represents an increase of &euro;232 million on the 2005 Estimates. It is also the highest ever commitment to social welfare spending in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>The corresponding pre-budget figure for 2005 was &euro;11.4 billion, and that was significantly boosted by the addition of &euro;874 million in a full year in the 2005 budget.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Estimates for my Department in the Abridged Estimates Volume are a framework to which the budget allocations will subsequently be added. They are therefore only the first stage in a two-stage process. The second stage will be completed next week with the announcement of the 2006 budget changes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The two main methods of measuring poverty in Ireland are the national &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; measure based on a relative income threshold of 60% of median income and enforced deprivation of certain items and the EU &ldquo;at risk <Col N="958"/>of poverty&rdquo; measure, which is simply based on 60% of median income.</P>
        <P>The 2003 EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions, EUSILC, indicates that 3.5% of people at work fell into the consistent poverty category, compared with 9.4% of the population generally. The survey further shows that 9.2% of people in Ireland who were at work were at risk of poverty, compared with 22.7% of the population generally.</P>
        <P>It is clear from those figures that being at work significantly reduces the risks of poverty and deprivation. However, despite the economic advances of recent years, some families find themselves dependent on low-wage employment, leading to the phenomenon mentioned by the Deputy, the working poor.</P>
        <P>The reduction of poverty is a core objective of this Government. In that regard, accepting and keeping a job is seen as the most important route to escape poverty and to ensure social inclusion.</P>
        <P>However it is important to ensure that work &ldquo;pays&rdquo;, and several policy instruments crossing a range of Government Departments are used as a way of preventing poverty amongst the working poor. Those include changes to the taxation system, the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage, provision of training and access to lifelong learning opportunities, assistance with job search and placement, the introduction of flexible working arrangements and increased access to affordable child care, and changes to the social welfare system to support the transition to employment and improve the retention of non-cash benefits during that transition.</P>
        <P>One of the main policy responses in my Department, designed to address the problem of low-income working families, is the family income supplement, FIS, scheme. The scheme provides cash support amounting to a minimum of &euro;20 per week for employees who work a minimum of 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight. That preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be only marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Budget 2005 increased the FIS earnings thresholds by &euro;39 in respect of each family size. That increase was unprecedented since the introduction of the scheme in 1984 and added &euro;23.40 to the weekly payments of most existing FIS recipients from January 2005. The cost of that measure is estimated at &euro;15.53 million in 2005. Following the increased thresholds, it is estimated that 2,600 additional families became eligible for a FIS payment. The ongoing development of the FIS scheme has resulted in current levels of both applications and claims in payment being at an all-time high. In 2004, there were 21,000 applications, and over 15,000 claims in payment. The current average FIS payment is almost &euro;94.</P><Col N="959"/>
        <P>Effective and adequate support for making work pay will continue to be a major priority for this Government and for me as Minister.</P>

	<P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to a scheme of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners resident in all parts of the island. The scheme would enable pensioners resident in Ireland to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland would travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in this State.</P>
        <P>In July 1995, my Department introduced the cross-Border free travel scheme. That scheme extended free travel entitlement so that free travel pass-holders resident in Ireland could undertake a cross-Border journey from a point of departure in one jurisdiction to a destination in the other jurisdiction free of charge.</P>
        <P>My Department covers the full cost of cross-Border journeys made by Department of Social and Family Affairs pass-holders. It also covers the cost of the Southern element of cross-Border journeys undertaken by Northern Ireland pass-holders.</P>
        <P>Under its own concessionary fares scheme, the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland covers the cost of the Northern element of cross-Border bus and rail journeys made by Northern Ireland pass-holders.</P>
        <P>Some 220,000 cross-Border journeys are undertaken each year, at a total cost of &euro;2.9 million; my Department pays &euro;2.5 million, and the remaining &euro;0.4 million is covered by the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The introduction of an all-Ireland free travel scheme would further extend the existing arrangements by allowing pass-holders to take onward journeys free of change. The cost of an all-Ireland free travel scheme would ultimately depend upon the extent to which pass-holders avail of it.</P>
        <P>My predecessor initiated discussions with the then Minister of State at the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland in September 2004.</P>
        <P>Most recently, the proposed scheme was discussed at the British-Irish intergovernmental conference on 27 June 2005, and I met Mr. Shaun Woodward MP, Parliamentary Undersecretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, the follow<Col N="960"/>ing week, during which we discussed the introduction of a scheme.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department have regular contacts with their counterparts in the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland concerning the operation of the existing cross-Border free travel scheme. Discussions regarding the introduction of the proposed all-Ireland free travel scheme have also taken place.</P>
        <P>Since I met Shaun Woodward MP, there have been further discussions between officials from the two sides and two meetings specifically related to the introduction of the proposed scheme have taken place; one in Dublin on 10 August and one in Belfast on 9 September last. I understand that another meeting between my officials and the authorities in Belfast is being scheduled for the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Examination of this proposal to date has highlighted several significant issues that require resolution before a scheme can be introduced. Those include policy, operational, financial and technical matters. My Department is working to progress those matters with relevant parties including the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The role of my Department in supporting emigrant groups has centred on providing good quality, clear and comprehensive information for Irish citizens wishing to emigrate and those hoping to return to Ireland to live. My Department ensures that appropriate and relevant information for emigrants is available by funding and supporting the various voluntary and community groups and organisations involved in that work.</P>
        <P>In carrying out those functions, my Department works closely with the Irish abroad unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has primary responsibility for policy regarding emigrants and their support while abroad.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, Emigrant Advice is the main voluntary organisation disseminating information for emigrants. This year, I increased the core funding for this organisation from &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000. That funding will enable Emigrant Advice to continue its valuable work in providing information and support to emigrants from their drop-in centre in Dublin. It will also enable them to update information publications for emigrants and to maintain their website, at <i>www.emigrantadvice.ie</i>.</P><Col N="961"/>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to Emigrant Advice, my Department provides grants to other organisations and groups disseminating information to emigrants. This year I substantially increased to &euro;80,000 the funding for the Safe Home programme, run by the Mayo-based organisation dedicated to helping elderly Irish emigrants wishing to return to Ireland to live but lacking the means to do so. From time to time, other voluntary and community groups and organisations involved in information dissemination to emigrants apply for grants to my Department. All applications are considered on their merits and are subject to the budget allocation available at the time of application.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The funding provided by my Department to those organisations is in line with one of the main recommendations of the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants, which was published in August 2002. The task force recommended that there should be close co-operation between various Departments and voluntary agencies regarding the provision of advice and information to emigrants. The increase in funding by my Department over the past few years to the voluntary and community sector involved in that work has enabled them to enhance the information services that they provide in preparing people for life working in another country and in assisting those who wish to return home.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Family income supplement is a payment made to low-income families with children who are in employment. Family income supplement was introduced in 1984 to provide income support for employees with families who are on low earnings, preserving the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were fully reliant on social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Weekly payments of FIS are made to families, including one-parent families, with children, that is, under 18, or between 18 and 22 if in full-time education, where one or more parent is in full-time remunerative employment of not less than 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight, where the employment is likely to last at least three months, and where the income of the family is less than the prescribed weekly amount.</P>
        <P>The Government has increased the weekly income thresholds for qualification for a family income supplement payment by &euro;84.00 since <Col N="962"/>2002. That has resulted in a net increase in FIS available to low-income families of &euro;50.40 per week. Also, the minimum weekly payment was increased from &euro;13 to &euro;20 from January 2004.</P>
        <P>On the question of measuring take-up of family income supplement, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three potentially eligible claimants was actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher, at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure. We understand that research undertaken more recently by the ESRI will be made publicly available in the first quarter of 2006.</P>

        <Quest>the basis for his Department&rsquo;s original estimate that the granting of pensions to <Col N="963"/>persons who paid social welfare contributions prior to 1953 would cost &euro;9 million per year, when the actual cost has turned out to be &euro;153 million per year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2000, a special half rate old age contributory pension was introduced to enable people with pre-1953 insurance who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension. People already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate could also benefit from the scheme. In order to be eligible for the payment, a person requires 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions.</P>
        <P>Based on an analysis of pension claims which did not satisfy the standard conditions and on experience of take up on previous pension measures, it was estimated that some 3,000 persons would qualify for the new pension in 2000 at a full year cost of &euro;8.9 million. The overall claimload ultimately was not expected to exceed 5,000 people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date a total of 34,538 pre-1953 pensions have been awarded and 28,700 of these remain in payment. Just over 67% of these pensions are being paid to residents of the UK and other countries. The cost in 2004, which includes the budget increases in those payments and arrears, amounted to &euro;132.5 million. The estimated cost for 2005 is &euro;135 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the difficulties in estimating costs in this case was that the form in which records relating to pre-1953 contributions were available in my Department did not allow for ready estimation of the numbers of contributions. Many of the records in question were incomplete and had to be supplemented by separate information obtained when claims were actually made. Furthermore, my Department, in basing the estimate on its databases, did not anticipate the number of successful claims which would be made by people resident abroad.</P>
        <P>My Department is frequently required to estimate the costs of policy measures and its record in this regard is a good one as has been recognised by the Department of Finance. The experience in this case was highly unusual and, as I have explained, related to lack of data. However, my Department will take on board the specific lessons of this project in estimating the costs of similar proposals in the future.</P>

	<P>My Department assists and encourages long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by the Department&rsquo;s employment support service.</P>
        <P>One significant measure is the back to work allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>Currently there are 9,244 participants in the scheme, over half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self-employment options.</P>
        <P>Another measure offered by my Department&rsquo;s employment support service is the back to education allowance programme. This is a second-chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force. There were 7,308 participants in the scheme for the 2004-05 year. A range of other supports is provided by the Department&rsquo;s locally based facilitators. Their primary role is to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them on an individual basis with assistance to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand. Facilitators have access to some additional services, such as the special projects and family services funds, which provide funding for specialised training and supports for those who are distant from the labour market and who need additional help in preparing them for further training and employment.</P>
        <P>One of the supports targeted specifically at the unemployed is the employment action plan, EAP, under which customers aged 18 to 54 years who are approaching six months on the live register are systematically referred to F&Aacute;S for guidance, intervention or placement.</P>
        <P>Under that process, a total of 36,289 individuals were referred to F&Aacute;S for interview during 2004 and by the end of January 2005 some 23,055 persons, 64% of those referred, had left the live register. Of those, a total of 13,092 persons were placed in jobs or a F&Aacute;S programme or had returned to education.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures available from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment show that 20,063 persons were referred during the first seven months of 2005. By the end of August 2005, a total of 9,628 persons, 47% of those referred, had left the live register.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, an intensification process commenced in May 2003. Under that process, all customers aged between 18 and 55 years who have spent over six months on the live regis<Col N="965"/>ter and who have not been previously selected for the EAP are being selected for referral to F&Aacute;S where they are offered interventions similar to those available under the EAP.</P>
        <P>By the end of July 2005 a total of 25,149 persons had been referred to F&Aacute;S under that process. During the first seven months of 2005 alone, a total of 4,933 persons were referred for interview, and of those 2,033, or 41%, subsequently left the live register.</P>
        <P>Certain customers referred through the EAP process may face severe employability issues not amenable to resolution within the normal range of interventions available. To assist such customers, a high-supports process was established in 2003 by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>As part of that process, local networks of relevant service-providers are being established in certain areas in conjunction with F&Aacute;S and my Department&rsquo;s facilitators.

The services provided, particularly their continued relevance and flexibility, are under constant review. I am particularly interested in advancing measures that blend activation with supports and that make the transition from welfare to work as seamless as possible.</P>

	<P>Arising from comment in the media, my Department carried out an examination of accesses to the computer record of the person concerned. During the period examined, our records show that 125 accesses to the record in question took place.</P>
        <P>On a general basis, staff of my Department are authorised to access individual records as long as it is for legitimate business reasons. In view of the number of accesses, managers were asked to examine the matter to establish if there were genuine business reasons for their staff accessing the record. The staff concerned have been asked to set out the reason they accessed the record, and managers have drawn up reports on the basis of their replies. Those reports are currently being collated and considered by the personnel officer. If it is established that there was inappropriate access to records by a staff member, the matter will be dealt with in accordance with the Civil Service disciplinary procedures.</P>
        <P>My Department views its obligations to safeguard the privacy of data under its control very seriously and has undertaken a considerable amount of work in that area over the past few years.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 97 together.</P>
        <P>The question of allowing older people to defer claiming their social welfare pension is something which has been under consideration by my Department and which features in the recently completed national pensions review.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking, the system would involve people being offered the option of deferring drawing their social welfare pension in exchange for a larger pension starting at a later date. The increase in the deferred pension would be actuarially based to ensure that the person involved received the benefit of any savings which would accrue from the decision to defer claiming. The advantage to individuals from that measure would depend on the demographic situation at the time of implementation, in particular improvements in life expectancy.</P>
        <P>The report on the review is at present before the Government for consideration by my Cabinet colleagues. When that process has been completed, I expect that the report will be published, and I would hope that it would engender a national discussion on the future of our pensions system. At that stage, groups representing employers and older people will be very welcome to give their views on any measures proposed.</P>

	<P>My recent written reply to the Deputy stated that there had been a decrease of 781 customers in receipt of farm assist in the 12 months to September 2005. There are several reasons for that drop-off in numbers, not least of which has been the take-up of the rural social scheme, which is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. That scheme specifically targets low-income farmers. There are currently around 1,930 customers availing of that scheme, 760 of whom transferred from farm assist.</P>
        <P>My Department examined 786 farm assist claims closed in the three-month period to October 2005. The results showed that 108, or 13.7%, went to work, 66, or 8.4%, took up places on community employment or rural social schemes, while 116, or 14.8%, took up educational opportunities. The remaining 496 transferred to other social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant improvement in off-farm employment in recent times that has reduced the need for small farmers to avail of the farm assist scheme. In addition, schemes such as the back to education allowance scheme allow customers to improve their educational qualifications by taking up second level or third level courses without affecting their underlying payment.</P>
        <P>My Department strives to offer opportunities to customers to take up meaningful employment or opportunities to improve their skills. The effectiveness of this policy is shown in the reduction in the numbers claiming basic payments such as farm assist.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction contained in the rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>
        <P>Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appro<Col N="970"/>priate to the system have access to it when in need.</P>
        <P>A total of 1,942 claims for unemployment assistance from nationals from the ten new EU states have been decided since 1 May 2004. To put that in perspective, nearly 160,000 personal public service, PPS, numbers were issued to nationals of the new member states in that period. As of 18 November 2005 the number of people from the new member states on the live register was 1,329. Of these, 789 were claiming unemployment assistance, 514 unemployment benefit and 26 PRSI credits only. A total of 462 of the 1,329 were awaiting decisions on unemployment assistance claims and 173 were awaiting decisions on unemployment benefit claims.</P>
        <P>This data does not support a view that welfare tourism is a problem. However, in introducing a habitual residence condition, the Government wished to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when in need. A review of the condition is ongoing at present within my Department and will be available to shortly, at which stage I will consider what, if any, changes might be made in light of experience to date.</P>

	<P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The conditions for entitlement to the third level option of the back to education allowance scheme were revised with effect from 1 September 2004. From that date, the qualifying period was increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme to 12 months in the last budget. I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from &euro;254 to &euro;400. These changes came into effect on 1 September 2005. Following an undertaking to the D&aacute;il and the social affairs committee, I have further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to nine months. This condition applies to persons who are participating in the national employment action plan, NEAP, process and where a F&Aacute;S employment services officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of <Col N="971"/>study as essential to the enhancement of the individuals employment prospects. This new condition also came into effect from 1 September 2005.</P>
        <P>The BTEA scheme was always intended to benefit people who had difficulty finding employment because of a lack of education qualifications. In many cases, people who have not completed second level education are held back in their efforts to obtain employment. The qualification period for people who wish to pursue second level education has remained at six months and the numbers taking second level education with the support of BTEA are increasing. The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period of time has always been a feature of the back to education allowance scheme and is considered necessary in order to ensure that limited resources are targeted at those who are most in need of second chance education. The scheme is intended to assist people with a history of long-term dependence on social welfare and is recognition of the special difficulties which such persons can face when attempting to equip themselves for the modern labour force.</P>

	<P>My Department has been allocated funding of &euro;3.75 million for e-Government related projects in 2006. My Department is undertaking three specific e-Government related programmes of work, namely, customer object development, public service identity and the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE. The ultimate aim of these programmes is to improve the service the Department provides to the customer and to support similar initiatives by other Departments.</P>
        <P>My Department, through its service delivery modernisation programme, is moving from a <Col N="972"/>number of scheme oriented computer systems to a more integrated approach based around our customers&rsquo; needs. This is a multi-annual programme of work involving the introduction of new technology and the replacement of legacy computer systems. On the technology side it involves the redesign of back office systems, business processes, procedures and work practices. It also involves the introduction of new organisational structures. The programme, which comprises business, organisation and technical streams, is designed to be implemented in self-contained and separately procured phases. Each phase delivers key business benefits, extends the business object model chosen by the Department and strengthens and enhances the underlying technical architecture.</P>
        <P>One key aspect of this programme is the further development of the customer object. This development not only supports internal systems but will also play a key role in supporting external systems that rely on use of the PPS number. The work involves examining customers&rsquo; future needs in the context of integrated service delivery and of supporting improved access to my Department&rsquo;s services via the telephone or on-line channels. It will also support my Department in proactively initiating claims for our customers. The ensuing implementation will support flexible, personalised and case driven customer service.</P>
        <P>The benefits of integrated service delivery extend beyond my Department. For example, the award winning automation of the child benefit payment following the birth of a child eliminates the need for multiple form filling and visits to several agencies&rsquo; offices. My Department has a broad public service wide role in supporting use of the PPS number across Departments and agencies. At present, it provides basic public service identity, PSI, services through Reach. PSI services provide a validation service to agencies using the PPS number and ensure that a consistent and limited set of customer identity data is used for public services.</P>
        <P>PSI services will be delivered in two phases. The first phase is already developed and is available via automated link to the Reach public services broker, PSB. It is envisaged that there will be a demand for a broader set of PSI services over the next number of years and implementation of the customer object will provide the technical basis for the delivery of these enhanced services.</P>
        <P>A third related programme of work concerns the development of a public service card in accordance with the SAFE programme. My Department is committed to the introduction of a new public service card in 2007 to provide easier access to public services for customers. The customer object and PSI services will provide the basic support for issue and operation of the card.</P>

	<P>Tapers and income disregards are a feature of the social welfare system.

Examples of such measures for people returning to work include: one parent family payment &mdash; the first &euro;146.50 of weekly earnings is disregarded as well as 50% of earnings from &euro;146.51 to &euro;293.00; unemployment assistance &mdash; 40% of net earnings from part-time work are disregarded; retention of rent-mortgage interest supplement and other secondary benefits is permitted on a tapered basis in certain circumstances; tapered withdrawal of adult and child dependant allowances as the spouse-partner&rsquo;s earnings from employment increase; farm assist &mdash; 30% of earnings from self-employment are disregarded; and family income supplement; 40% of net earnings are disregarded. Further improvements to existing tapers, and the introduction of new ones, are matters which fall to be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU member states without the transitional limitations which were being imposed at that time by many of the other member states. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other <Col N="974"/>factor. The EU Commission wrote to the Government on 22 December 2004 raising a number of issues concerning its compliance with EU law in relation to workers and their families.</P>
        <P>Officials from this Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office met with Commission officials on 15 May last to discuss the issues raised and explained that the operation of the new condition was fully in line with the criteria set out in European Court of Justice case law.</P>
        <P>These are: the length and continuity of residence in a particular country; the length and purpose of absence from Ireland; the nature and pattern of the employment; the applicant&rsquo;s main centre of interest; and the future intention of applicant concerned as it appears from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P>In addition, full consideration is given in the decision making process to the requirements of EU legislation regarding free movement of workers within the European Economic Area. Rules which apply to migrant workers, that is persons who have taken up employment in Ireland following their arrival here, are strictly observed.</P>
        <P>A formal response by the EU Commission to the points made is still awaited. It is expected that the Commission&rsquo;s examination of the matter will be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties by the end of this year. There are no plans to remove the habitual residence condition. Its operation has and continues to be monitored constantly by my Department.</P>

	<P>From 2005 the allo<Col N="977"/>cation of money between programmes is a matter for the HSE. It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home and in accordance with their wishes, and at the same time to provide a high quality of residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained at home.</P>
        <P>The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 to assist people with the financial cost of a private nursing home bed. It was never intended to cover the full cost of nursing home care. Since 1993, there have been significant levels of investment in the nursing home subvention scheme. On the introduction of the scheme in 1993, &euro;5 million was allocated. The amount allocated to the scheme in 2004 and 2005 was &euro;143 million and &euro;140 million, respectively. The final figures for 2005 will obviously not be ready for some time but it may be noted that based on the latest available information, June 2005 as against June 2004, there has been a significant increase of 18% for those persons in receipt of an enhanced subvention. The allocation for 2006 is not finalised as yet but it is very likely that the 2006 figure will show an increase over 2004 and 2005.</P>
        <P>Numerous studies have highlighted the fact that older people would prefer to remain living at home rather than going into long-stay care. The Government is committed to developing both the provision and standard of residential care for older people and also the various community and home support schemes.</P>

The overall recommendations relating to functions in the two reports were accepted by Government and it was agreed that the Department should be re-organised. The legal framework for this reform has been put in place with the Health Act 2004. One of the main functions of my Department under the Act is the role of policy analysis, its development and prioritisation. The role also includes, on the Health Service Executive, the measurement of performance, monitoring of the financial position and service provision together with evaluating efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery.</P>
        <P>A dedicated unit has been established in my Department to monitor and evaluate the provision of services by the HSE. This role includes regular meetings between my Department and the executive to review progress at a national level. Regular meetings on particular aspects of service delivery also occur between officials in my Department and their counterparts in the Health Service Executive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 120 together.</P><Col N="981"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would allow them to determine the numbers of workers moving out of employment status and becoming self-employed service providers. While overall numbers in both employment and self-employment continue to grow, Revenue has no hard data that might indicate the existence or otherwise of any substitution trend: that is of workers in employment reclassifying themselves as self-employed.</P>
        <P>I am informed that Revenue does not accept at face value contractual assertions as to self-employment status; the true nature of the relationship between the parties is looked at having regard to criteria derived from extensive case law, for example, the degree of control, obligation, integration or exclusivity involved in the relationship. These criteria are published in a Code of Practice in Determining Employment Status that was compiled with the assistance of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. A copy of the code of practice is annexed to this reply.</P>
        <P>Revenue operates an extensive audit programme to police compliance with tax laws, including obligations to apply PAYE and PRSI in cases where they are satisfied that the true nature of the relationship is that of employer and employee. I am informed that in cases and sectors where there is a particular risk of mis-classification, the matter of employee-subcontractor status is generally examined as a routine part of a Revenue audit.</P>
        <P>Special projects are also undertaken from time to time in this area, for example, in 1998-99 the tax status of some 63,000 persons within the relevant contracts tax scheme was reviewed &mdash; involving approximately 7,000 visits &mdash; and close to 90% of principal contractors visited were found to have either correctly classified their employees/contractors or agreed to abide by Revenue&rsquo;s ruling as to the correct treatment. Other examples of sectors looked at closely by Revenue in this regard include the security industry, the courier business and the education and health sectors. However, no detailed outcome statistics are available on these sectors.</P>
        <P>As regards the Exchequer and Social Insurance Fund implications of any trend away from employment and into self-employment, this would mainly impact on PRSI: the employer&rsquo;s PRSI contribution is, for most employees,<?oasys _jy?>10.75%. There may also be some reduction in income tax receipts because of the different rules for allowable expenses between self-employed Schedule D taxpayers and employees.</P>
        <P>On the question of policy implications for Revenue, Revenue&rsquo;s function in this area, as in all other areas of its mandate, is to maximise compliance with tax laws. It selects cases and sectors for audit and compliance programmes on a risk <Col N="982"/>management basis. It will take appropriate action where it finds that an employee has been wrongly classified as a contractor.</P>
        <P>On the breakdown in the three sectors referred to in the questions, I am informed that the number of sub-contractors on Revenue&rsquo;s register for relevant contracts tax is as follows: construction industry, 59,982; meat processing, 771; and forestry, 1,392. These figures include both individuals and companies. I am informed that Revenue does not have reliable and up-to-date statistics for the number of employees in these three sectors. I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they fully recognise the particular risks of mis-classification in the relevant sectors of the economy and they will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

        <P LI="1">This leaflet has been prepared by the Employment Status Group set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The group was set up because of a growing concern that there may be increasing numbers of individuals categorised as &lsquo;self employed&rsquo; when the &lsquo;indicators&rsquo; may be that &lsquo;employee&rsquo; status would be more appropriate. The purpose of the document is to eliminate misconceptions and provide clarity. It is not meant to bring individuals who are genuinely self-employed into employment status.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. However, it may not always be so obvious, which in turn can lead to misconceptions in relation to the employment status of individuals.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The criteria below should help in reaching a conclusion. It is important that the job as a whole is looked at including working conditions and the reality of the relationship, when considering the guidelines. The overriding consideration or test will always be whether the person performing the work does so &ldquo;as a person in business on their own account&rdquo;. Is the person a free agent with an economic independence of the person engaging the service?</P><Col N="983"/>

	<P>The purchase of a site for the purposes of building a home may be liable to stamp duty at the rates applicable to non-residential property depending on the value of the site. VAT is charged on certain goods and services associated with building a house. There is no special tax relief for single parents in the stamp duty or VAT codes. However, certain income tax reliefs are available to assist single parent home-owners.</P>
        <P>Single parents can avail of relief for interest paid on certain home loans under section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Mortgage interest relief is available to individuals in respect of interest paid on loans used by the individuals solely for the purpose of defraying money <Col N="989"/>employed in the purchase, repair, development or improvement of their main residence.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>With respect to tax credits, single, separated or widowed persons may be entitled to the one-parent family tax credit in addition to the basic personal tax credit. The combined value of these credits is equivalent to that of the basic personal tax credit for a married person. Through the one-parent tax credit, and the extended standard rate band available to parents who qualify for such credit, the tax code recognises the financial burden involved where a lone parent has responsibility for raising a child or children single-handedly.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that child benefit is the main instrument through which direct financial support is provided to parents in respect of children and, of course, this is available whether the parents are single, cohabiting or married. The Government has substantially increased child benefit since coming into office in 1997. Overall expenditure on child benefit has increased by 279% from &euro;506 million in 1997 to an estimated &euro;1,916 million in 2005.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not the practice to comment in the lead up to the annual budget and Finance Bill on the intention or otherwise to make changes in taxation.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to deposit accounts where the interest payable is subject to deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, under section 256 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. DIRT is charged at the standard rate of income tax, 20%, on interest payable on the following types of deposit accounts: deposit accounts where interest is paid annually or at more frequent intervals; and long-term savings accounts where interest is pay<Col N="990"/>able at a determinable rate, that is, where the rate is known or can be anticipated.</P>
        <P>The 23% rate of DIRT applies only in the case of deposit accounts where the amount of the interest cannot be determined until the date on which it is actually paid. Examples are products known as &ldquo;trackers&rdquo; where the rate of interest to be paid will be determined by reference to the overall change in the share index of a stock exchange or some other financial index.</P>
        <P>DIRT is a final liability tax and no further liability arises to the individual on the interest. DIRT may be repaid only to the following categories of recipients: companies, within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the deposit interest; trustees of a trust for the benefit of a permanently incapacitated individual; a charity; or individuals where they or their spouses are 65 years or older or are permanently incapacitated &mdash; but only to the extent that such an individual, because of personal reliefs or age exemption etc., would not otherwise be liable to income tax on the deposit interest.</P>
        <P>While not a retention tax, an &ldquo;exit tax&rdquo; of 23% is applied, on encashment, to the growth in the investment in the case of domestic life insurance policies or investment undertakings where the investment took place after 1 January 2001. An exit tax of 23% is also applicable on withdrawals from, cessation of or maturity of SSIA accounts. When an SSIA account matures &mdash; on death or at the end of the five year period &mdash; the exit tax is liable on only the profit earned from the investment of both the subscriptions and the Exchequer tax credits.</P>

	<P>All SSIA accounts are subject to tax at 23% upon withdrawal, cessation or maturity. Where a withdrawal is made, the aggregate value of the assets withdrawn is taxable at 23%. An account that is ceased prior to maturity is liable to tax at 23% on the aggregate value of all the assets in the account at time of cessation. When an SSIA account matures &mdash; an SSIA account matures either on death or at the end of the five year period &mdash; tax at 23% is liable on only the profit earned from the investment of both the subscriptions and the Exchequer tax credits.</P>

Kildare County Council inquired, in September 2005, about the availability of funding to progress the prospect of a flood relief scheme at Ardclough, but due to existing commitments it has not been possible to address this request. The position will be reviewed in light of the 2006 budgetary allocation for flood relief works.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase 1 of this programme has delivered fibre <Col N="992"/>optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget. This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the current phase, Cork County Council submitted designs for 15 towns to the Department in the following locations: Bantry, Blarney, Carrigaline, Charleville, Cobh, Dunmanway, Fermoy, Kanturk, Kinsale, Midleton, Mitchelstown, Passage West, Ringaskiddy, Skibbereen and Youghal. Clonakilty is not part of the current roll-out but may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available. The procurement process is now under way for the detailed design and project management of the Cork networks. It is expected that the Cork MANs will be operational by next year.</P>
        <P>My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The final actual outturn on profits by the company for the last five years are in 1999 operational profits of &euro;9.8 million, in 2000 operational profits of &euro;13.3 million, in 2001 losses of &euro;6.7 million, in 2002 losses of &euro;17.4 million, in 2003 losses of &euro;42.9 million and due mainly to the policy of controlled financial management in line with the recovery strategy, and the non payment of Sustaining Progress, operating profits of &euro;1.8 million in 2004.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the company has suffered significant losses in recent years starting with &euro;6.7 million in 2001 and then reaching an unsustainable level of &euro;42.9 million in 2003. The deterioration of company finances did not happen overnight but over a number of years. The downturn in An Post&rsquo;s financial position has been attributed to inflated forecasts of growth and the inability to deliver on change management prog<Col N="993"/>rammes such as automation. Between 2001 and 2002 payroll costs alone increased by &euro;40 million and the main divisions in An Post, Letterpost, SDS and the post office were all operating at a loss in 2001 and 2002.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.4- ?>
        <P>It was against this background that the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources expressed serious concern about the situation in the company and asked for a recovery strategy. The company presented a recovery strategy to the then Minister in September 2003. The detail and implementation of this recovery strategy which involves reductions in staff numbers and changes in work practices has formed the basis for the negotiations between the company and unions which have spanned the last two years. With the acceptance by the An Post board of the Labour Court recommendations which issued last week and the backing of the recommendations by the CWU executive committee in advance of the ballot of the union&rsquo;s members, I am hopeful that the company with the support of its workers, will implement the changes necessary to see An Post continue as a serious player in the Irish postal market delivering high quality postal services to customers.</P>

This new mandate envisages an active, focused role for the company, complementary to that of national agencies in line with Government policy on regional development. It is also broadly in line with the company&rsquo;s own future strategy proposals submitted to me in March 2005. In approving the new mandate, I asked the company to give priority to activities that would address the needs of the less developed parts of the Shannon region. I have asked the company to prepare a three year corporate plan for the period 2006-2008 which would reflect the substance of the new mandate.</P>
        <P>In so far as the needs of the less developed parts of the region are concerned, I have not formally designated any specific areas. I expect the corporate plan being prepared by Shannon Development to pay particular attention to this requirement of the mandate and to have regard to the needs of less developed areas as already identified through the regional planning guidelines process.</P>

        <Quest>the reason an Irish born citizen who has returned from America to care for their mother has been refused the carer&rsquo;s allowance under the habitual residence condition even though the person is an Irish resident; if the Department is legal in its decision in view of the fact that this person is an Irish citizen who had lived here until they moved away and has come home to look after their mother.</Quest>

	<P>As detailed in the reply to a parliamentary question, reference number 36066/05, on 23 November 2005, the person concerned applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of two carers on 4 October 2005. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test that applies is satisfied. Additionally, the requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes including carer&rsquo;s allowance with effect from 1 May 2004. All applicants, regardless of nationality, are required to be habitually resident in the State in order to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.</P>
        <P>A person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. Having examined all the facts in the case raised by the Deputy, a deciding officer decided that the person does not satisfy the habitual residence condition on the grounds that she has not been continuously resident in the State or in the common travel area for the last two years. Furthermore, it is not clear that she intends to reside in the State permanently from now on and she has maintained substantial links abroad by retaining property in the USA. She was notified of this decision, the reason for it and the right to an appeal on 21 November 2005. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</P>

	<P>The personal public service number is the citizen&rsquo;s unique reference number for all dealings with Departments and public bodies. A PPS number does not issue automatically except in the case of children born in Ireland. In all other cases application must be made in person at one of the Department&rsquo;s local offices. It is necessary to have effective controls around the PPS number registration process to guard against fraud and to protect the integrity of my Department&rsquo;s data. It is also important to ensure that a person receives only one number, and that the number is allocated on information that is accurate and verified and therefore certain procedures are set down to be followed by officers of my Department when dealing with applications.</P>
        <P>Evidence of identity is a vital element of the allocation process. When applying for a PPS number, applicants are asked to complete an application form and supply documentation to establish their identity. In the case of an EU citizen, they will be asked to provide a current valid passport and evidence of residence in this country, for example a copy of a tenancy agreement and-or a utility bill. Once the application is satisfactorily completed, people are usually informed of their PPS number by post within five days. Staff in the client identity services section of my Department will provide advice and assistance to an applicant or someone acting on their behalf if any difficulties arise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>Some 7,880 farm families are currently in receipt of payments under the farm assist scheme from a high of approximately 8,700 in 2003. It was difficult to estimate the likely level of take-up of the scheme since the numbers availing of its predecessor, small-holders assistance, had been in decline for several years before farm assist was first introduced in April 1999. The benefits to those who have joined the scheme have been significant. The average weekly payment is approximately &euro;150.</P>
        <P>There are a number of factors which have an impact on the take-up of the scheme, notably, the significant increase in off-farm employment in recent years and the introduction of the rural social scheme by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Of the 2,000 farmers in receipt of RSS, approximately 760 are listed by the Department as having transferred directly from farm assist. A major media campaign on local radio to promote farm assist was conducted in the autumn of 2002 at a cost of almost &euro;100,000. The campaign consisted of prime time spots in 19 local radio stations and the placing of adverts in the provincial newspapers and farmer&rsquo;s publications. During the same period, an information video about the scheme was transmitted at 24 livestock marts nationwide. The video was also shown on a large screen at the national ploughing championships in September 2002 and in each subsequent year including this year.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s information service, in conjunction with the IFA, gave information presentations on the scheme to groups of farmers at various locations throughout the country. The farm assist video was shown at the presentations and was followed by a questions and answers session. In 2003 another advert was placed in the <i>Irish Farmers Handbook</i>. Significant improvements to the scheme were announced in last year&rsquo;s budget. These included a &euro;14 weekly increase in farm assist for a single person and up to &euro;23.30 per week for a married person. In addition, the capital disregard in the means assessment increased from under &euro;12,700 to &euro;20,000 in June 2005. The <Col N="1000"/>question of a further increase in farm assist is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context having regard to available resources and government commitments.</P>

        <Quest>the number of persons in receipt of the family income supplement payment; the number of persons his Department estimate are eligible for such a payment; the steps being taken by his Department to make persons aware of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The number of people receiving family income supplement is 16,650. This represents an increase of approximately 40% in the past three years. It is difficult to estimate the number of families who fail to apply for their entitlements under the FIS scheme. However, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure. The ESRI is looking again at this issue given the availability of new data since that time.</P>
        <P>My Department undertakes a number of proactive measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to FIS, which include advising all newly awarded one parent family payment recipients, advising all employers annually in PRSI mailshots and examining entitlements in all awarded back to work allowance cases. Information on FIS is contained on all child benefit books and can be assessed on the Department&rsquo;s website. The scheme has been extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers and radio, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots. In addition, a magazine for lone parents called <i>Options and Opportunities</i> was issued to every lone parent in receipt of the one parent family payment this year. It included a full page outlining the details of the family income supplement.</P>

	<P>The home-maker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to assist those who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment, caring either for children aged up to six years or incapacitated people are disregarded when calculating a person&rsquo;s pension entitlements. The Social Welfare Act 1996 extended the home-maker provisions by increasing the age of children being cared for from six to 12 years. Under existing provisions for old age contributory pension, up to 20 years home-making can be disregarded in calculating the yearly average test for pension purposes.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to qualify for any form of social assistance a person must satisfy a statutory means test. This means test includes a value attributed to any capital a person may have. Capital refers to savings, investments, cash-on-hands and property, excluding the person&rsquo;s own home. The value of all of these items is added together and a formula is applied to their total value to calculate a person&rsquo;s weekly means, depending on the particular social assistance scheme in involved.</P>
        <P>The rules for the means assessment of capital are set out in the Schedules to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, as amended subsequently. Under these rules means derived from capital or savings are assessed for supplementary welfare allowance purposes on a different basis than that applicable to other social assistance schemes. The policy basis for this is that supplementary welfare allowance is designed to provide assistance as a scheme of last resort, to ensure that every person in the State has sufficient resources to meet their basic income needs, as defined by the prevailing maximum rate of SWA. On this basis applicants are expected to utilise whatever other resources they have available to them in the first instance, including any income, capital or other savings. In the event that these resources are insufficient, as determined by the means assessment, then SWA is payable at an amount which brings their income position up to the prevailing basic income level.</P>
        <P>With effect from June 2005, the capital assessment for the social assistance schemes generally is as follows. The first &euro;20,000 of capital is disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed with a weekly value of &euro;1 per &euro;1,000 and the next &euro;10,000 is assessed with a weekly value of &euro;2 per <Col N="1002"/>&euro;1,000. The remainder is assessed with a weekly value of &euro;4 per &euro;1,000. For the purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance means test, capital is assessed as follows. The first &euro;520 of capital is assessed at 5%, and the balance of capital is assessed at 10%. The resulting figure is then divided by 52 to give the weekly value of the means.</P>
        <P>Given the objectives of the SWA scheme, it would be perverse to award SWA to a person with substantial savings or other capital. The capital assessment formula applicable to SWA is not intended to determine a potential rate of interest or income from the capital, but rather to ensure that any such capital or savings should be utilised by applicants towards their basic income needs. Apart from this assessment formula, any interest or income actually received by an applicant derived from this capital is not taken into account further for SWA means assessment purposes. The SWA scheme is currently being reviewed as part of my Department&rsquo;s series of expenditure evaluations. The review is being carried out by an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department with representatives from the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive. This review involves a full appraisal of the efficiency and effectiveness of all aspects of the scheme, including the means assessment rules. Any changes in the criteria for the means assessment of capital under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will be considered in the context of the recommendations of this review group when it reports in due course.</P>

	<P>Ireland has social security agreements with seven countries, namely, Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Switzerland. These agreements came into effect between 1989 and 1999, except for that with the United Kingdom, which came into effect in 1971. Ireland also has a bilateral understanding with Quebec since 1 October 1994.</P>
        <P>All of these agreements are currently in operation work satisfactorily. The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both <Col N="1004"/>in Ireland and the other country to which the agreement applies. In the case of Austria and Switzerland, they have limited application, as the EU regulations normally apply.</P>
        <P>An updated social security agreement with the United Kingdom, which provides for workers moving between Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands has been signed and it is hoped to have it ratified in the near future.</P>
        <P>A revised social security agreement with Australia was signed on 9 June 2005 and its terms were approved by the House on 22 November. The necessary steps are under way to bring it into force on 1 January 2006.</P>
        <P>Discussions have been held between officials of my Department and their counterparts in New Zealand regarding revision of that agreement also. As in the case of Australia, the amendments to the Irish provisions are likely to be few.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department and the Government of the Republic of Korea regarding the text of a proposed agreement. It is hoped that final agreement on the text will be reached shortly, and I will then be in a position to seek the approval of this House.</P>
        <P>There are no other plans at present to extend the number of countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements on social security. However, the matter is kept under review by my officials and further consideration will be given to any case which is warranted by the number of persons who have worked both in Ireland and the other country.</P>

        <P>Child benefit supports all children but delivers proportionately more assistance to those on low incomes and with larger families. It is not intended primarily to meet child care costs.

	<P>Weekly payments of family income supplement, FIS, are made to families, including one parent families, with children under 18 or between 18 and 22 if in full-time education, where one or more parent is in full-time remunerative employment of not less than 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight, where the employment is likely to last at least three months and where the income of the family is less than a prescribed weekly amount.</P>
        <P>In the period between September 2002 and September 2005, the consumer price index increased by 8.6%. The average FIS payment increased during this time by 47.2%. The number of FIS claims in payment is 16,650. This represents an increase of approximately 40% in the past three years.</P>
        <P>FIS income limits were increased by &euro;39 per week in budget 2005. This represents a net increase of &euro;23.40 per week for most recipients. Weekly FIS income limits have risen by &euro;84 since 2002. This represents a net increase of &euro;50.40. The guaranteed minimum weekly rate of payment for anyone who qualifies for FIS increased to &euro;20 from January 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of a further increase in FIS is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</P>

	<P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.</P>
        <P>The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household compo<Col N="1006"/>sition.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 158 to 161, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the specification of standards under section 19 of the Roads Act 1993, are a matter for the NRA.</P>
        <P>I understand that NRA&rsquo;s Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, which was originally published in December 2000, contains standards and advice notes relating to the design, assessment and operation of national roads in Ireland. The NRA requires that the design manual be used on all projects for the construction and/or improvement of national roads.</P>
        <P>While the design manual is not a statutory document, the NRA, as the agency with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national roads network and the funding of individual projects, requires that the technical standards specified in the document be adhered to.</P>
        <P>The NRA&rsquo;s Specification for Road Works, which was originally published in March 2000, contains detailed specifications for all elements of road works. The full document or relevant parts are included as part of the contract documents for individual road construction or improvement projects and must therefore be complied with as a contractual obligation.</P>
        <P>While the design manual and specification guidelines are intended primarily for use on national roads I understand that the documents may be used, at the discretion of road authorities, on non-national roads.</P>
        <P>There are no statutory minimum standards in relation to road resurfacing. I am informed that both the NRA&rsquo;s Specification for Road Works and Design Manual for Roads and Bridges include requirements regarding road surfacing and resurfacing.</P>
        <P>Guidance and recommendations regarding the provision and use of warning signs for road <Col N="1008"/>works, including road surfacing and surface dressing operations, are set out in chapter 8 of the traffic signs manual published by my Department.</P>
        <P>The present manual, which constitutes a direction given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport pursuant to section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, is currently the subject of a comprehensive review. A draft of the chapter of the manual relating to the traffic sign system applied at roadwork sites has been prepared. The draft document is now in the process of being issued to local authorities and other interested parties to afford them the opportunity to provide input before its publication, which is expected in the first quarter of 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in my previous reply, Northern Ireland is the lead Administration for organisation and co-ordination of issues arising in the transport sector. Details of all previous BIC ministerial and BIC transport group meetings have been collated in consultation with the BIC secretariat and are summarised below.</P>
        <P>The agenda for the first BIC transport ministerial meeting, which was held in Belfast on 19 December 2000, included opening remarks from Ministers, a draft work programme on transport issues and a draft communique. In summary, the minutes note that members of the BIC held a <Col N="1009"/>wide-ranging debate on the discussion paper prepared by the Northern Ireland Executive. Members agreed the need for an integrated and sustainable approach to transport issues, which would take account of the relevant economic, social and environmental context. The key areas identified as priorities for initial work by officials were the exchange of information and expertise on public private partnership, PPP, regional air links, road safety and an integrated transport framework. The agenda for the next ministerial meeting, which is provisionally scheduled to take place in Belfast on 9 February 2006, has not yet been finalised.</P>
        <P>There have been six meetings of the BIC transport officials group. The key issues and agreed actions reached at each meeting are as follows. The first BIC transport group meeting was held on 4 December 2000. The agenda included a draft working paper and communiqu&eacute; for the ministerial meeting on 19 December 2000. Practical arrangements for the ministerial meeting and for future transport group meetings were agreed. On 22 May 2002, the group met to consider the outline programme of work agreed following the ministerial meeting of 19 December 2000. On integrated transport, my Department identified possible proposals for taking forward work and members were invited to express their views. Regarding PPP, the Northern Ireland Administration agreed to investigate the possibility of establishing a forum for the exchange of views and experience between BIC members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agenda for the meeting of 21 February 2003 included work programme items on integrated transport, road safety, regional airlinks and PPP. My Department presented an updated paper on integrated transport to reflect comments submitted by Members since the previous meeting. It was agreed to take forward a proposal by my Department to conduct a study of transport links between member Administrations. The Northern Ireland Administration presented a paper on road safety. It was agreed that an exchange of views on driving and misuse of drugs would be of benefit to all members. It was agreed that a paper defining the objectives of a workshop on this topic would be prepared and circulated. Regarding regional airlinks, it was noted that the United Kingdom was due to publish a White Paper on the subject following an extensive consultation process. Regarding PPP, it was agreed that it would be useful for Northern Ireland to investigate the possibility of holding a seminar on this topic focusing on transportation needs.</P>
        <P>At the meeting of 5 November 2004, the agenda focused on the agreed BIC work programme objectives. On integrated transport, the lead Administration proposed to circulate revised terms of reference for a scoping study intended to lead to more detailed research. It was proposed that relevant experts would evaluate various PPP models, with a view to making a recom<Col N="1010"/>mendation on any aspects of the subject, which would form the basis for further work within the BIC transport group.</P>
        <P>The workshop on driving and misuse of drugs, which was held on 8 March 2004, was also discussed and it was noted that further work on research in this area was proposed. It was agreed that the issue of mutual recognition of driving disqualifications would be considered for future co-operation and consultation by BIC member Administrations. The lead Administration circulated a draft transport work programme paper for a future BIC summit to be hosted in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The agenda and minutes of the meeting of 27 July 2005 included road safety issues, integrated transport and PPPs. Regarding road safety, there was a discussion on the legal complexities associated with the issue of mutual recognition of driving disqualifications and penalty points. It was noted that work on a bilateral agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications was progressing. It was also noted that a meeting of research experts would be arranged to examine the scope for closer co-operation in the area of driving and misuse of drugs. Regarding integrated transport, it was proposed that the group should consider redefining the objectives or content of this particular element of the BIC work programme. On PPPs, it was proposed that Administrations would identify relevant experts to participate in a workshop to share experience and expertise in the PPP area, given the different approaches adopted in each Administration.</P>
        <P>The most recent meeting of the BIC transport group was held on 25 November 2005. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss an agenda for the ministerial meeting and to agree a work programme for officials in preparation for that meeting. Minutes of the meeting have not yet been circulated.</P>
        <P>Regarding the drugs and driving workshop of 8 March 2004, the overall aim was to share information on action required to deal with the problem of drug driving within BIC Administrations from the enforcement, legislative, technical and research perspectives. A further workshop focusing on research in this area is currently being arranged. It is anticipated that a report of findings will issue following the workshop.</P>

        <P>The phased programme involves implementation initially of projects to meet short to medium-term demand levels, including the city-centre resignalling project, the quadrupling of a critical section of the Kildare line between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch, the opening of a new station in the Docklands, and the opening of the first phase of the Navan rail link as far as Pace, near Dunboyne.</P>
        <P>While these projects are under way, detailed technical, planning and design studies, as well as the railway order and procurement processes, will be completed for the interconnector. Construction will start in time to achieve completion of the tunnel, the underground stations and the electrification programme by 2015, thus providing the additional capacity required on the suburban rail network for longer-term needs.</P>
        <P>It is considered this phased approach to implementing Transport 21 is adequate to address changing demand levels. It also addresses the management of the construction programme by, for example, phasing tunnelling work in the city centre, with tunnelling work on metro north preceding the interconnector. It makes sense for the perspective of the effective management of the overall capital envelope.</P>

	<P>The sugar reform package agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers last week includes a voluntary restructuring scheme to encourage sugar factory closures and the renunciation of sugar quota. In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, the restructuring fund would provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs involved. At least 10% of the fund would be used to compensate sugar beet growers and machinery contractors notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is kept balanced according to a sound economic proposal.</P>
        <P>The formal legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received.

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that at present there is no specific legislation governing family reunification for migrants who are not refugees. There are a set of administrative procedures in place for non-refugees, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department. The report to the UN committee on the rights of the child states that the overall objective of these procedures is to facilitate family reunion where <Col N="1018"/>appropriate. The Deputy will also be aware that the forthcoming Immigration and Residence Bill will provide a specific statutory base for family reunification for migrants.</P>
        <P>With regard to family reunification for parents granted leave to remain, I am of the strong view that the policy pursued by my Department is not only justified but essential. It is not in breach of the UN convention. It must be borne in mind that family reunification for certain categories of persons granted leave to remain can be achieved by the departure of the family members from the State to rejoin the other family members who are abroad in the country of origin or of habitual residence. Public policy considerations justify any difference of general approach which may occur in these cases as against others.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to Question No. 146 on 20 October 2005. It is a fundamental requirement under the IBC/05 processing arrangements that each applicant submits a valid passport or national identity card as proof of identity. The passport submitted by the applicant in this case was referred to the Garda technical bureau for verification as to its authenticity. The advice from that bureau is that the passport was not genuine. The applicant was informed of this by letter dated 30 August 2005 and requested to submit a genuine passport. The applicant submitted a genuine passport on 21 September 2005.</P>
        <P>However, the basis for the refusal of the person&rsquo;s application is her failure to meet the continuous residency criteria and the submission of the earlier invalid passport was not a factor in this regard. In this context it should also be noted that continuous rather than habitual residence is the criterion to be met. A number of matters have been raised by the applicant following the refusal of her application, including matters regarding her health, and these will be taken into account by me in the context of consideration of the file under the terms of section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 10 July 2000 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He was informed by letter dated 1 May 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded three options under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely: to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain in the State; to leave the State voluntarily; or to consent to the making of a deportation order.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. Consideration was given to all representations received on his behalf. On 11 December 2003, a deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this <Col N="1020"/>order was served by registered post requiring him to present to the garda&iacute; in Kilkenny on Thursday, 22 January 2004, in order to make arrangements for his deportation from the State. He presented as requested and was given further presentation dates which he kept. He is due to present again to the Garda national immigration bureau on Tuesday, 13 December 2005 at 2 p.m.</P>
        <P>An application was made by his legal representatives to me under section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, seeking re-admission to the asylum process. This application has been rejected and was communicated to his legal representatives by letter dated 29 August 2005. The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda national immigration bureau.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Malin Garda station as of 29 November 2005 was two garda&iacute;. The allocation of personnel with a division is a matter for the local chief superintendent. I am informed by local Garda management that, at present, the sergeant in charge at Carndonagh Garda station has policing responsibility for the area until a replacement sergeant is allocated to Malin Garda station.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that every effort is made to fill vacancies that arise as a result of retirements, promotions etc., in conjunction with the allocation of newly attested garda&iacute; and newly promoted personnel. Garda management also states that the number of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>With regard to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. The needs of the Donegal division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources.</P>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and, in this context, the needs of the stations referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the three persons referred to by the Deputy were received in the citizenship section of my Department in September 1999. The applications were considered under the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship <Col N="1029"/>Act 1956, as amended, and it was decided not to grant certificates at that time.</P>
        <P>Based on the details supplied by the Deputy, and information on file about the previous applications, it appears that the most appropriate route to Irish citizenship for the persons concerned is the naturalisation process. Since the statutory requirements for naturalisation have changed since 1999, I have set out some general information about this process.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State, be of good character, have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. The applicant must intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation, and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court, or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission of the Minister to remain in the State, or where such permission was granted for the purposes of study or seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The three applicants involved are aged 26, 21 and 24, respectively, and must apply for naturalisation in their own right. Further information and the necessary application forms may be obtained from my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, or by telephoning the citizenship section helpline on Tuesdays or Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. at Lo-call 1890 551 500 or 01 6167700.</P>

Following the citizenship referendum of 2004 and the subsequent Immigration and Citizenship Amendment Act 2004 which came into effect on 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 is no longer automatically entitled to Irish citizenship by virtue of being born in Ireland. The applicant parent does not qualify to be considered for residency under the revised arrangements because the child in question was born after 1 January 2005.</P>

	<P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the first day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions.</P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature <Col N="1031"/>student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; income or address.</P>
        <P>In order to establish that a candidate is an independent mature student documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate&rsquo;s ordinary or permanent address from 1 October of the year preceding entry to college. Examples of documentary evidence required include telephone, gas or ESB bills.</P>
        <P>The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof is submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the schemes. To date the evidence submitted regarding independent status is not sufficient.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy should be aware that significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including learning support and resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1, projected in 2004-05. As I indicated in my statement on the recently published estimates, I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year. The Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circu<Col N="1032"/>lar 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools are structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for support services such as care-taking. This provides schools with considerable flexibility as to the manner in which such services are provided to cater for the needs of their pupils. Caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the numbers employed nor the terms and conditions, including pay, under which they are employed.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. I wish to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my recent announcement, in the context of the 2006 estimates, that the standard <i>per capita</i> grant which stood at &euro;266 per pupil will be increased by a further &euro;12 to &euro;298 per pupil from January next. Secondary schools will also benefit, under the school services support fund initiative, from further significant increases in the support services grant. The support grant that was increased for secondary schools from &euro;131 per pupil in January last to &euro;145 per pupil, will be increased by a further &euro;14 per pupil to &euro;159 per pupil in January next. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and care-taking services.</P>
        <P>Schools have welcomed these improvements. The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2006 Estimates, for these increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>

	<P>As I advised the Deputy in response to a parliamentary question, reference No. 32540/05, of 8 November 2005, my Department has recently conveyed its decision in this case to the relevant transport liaison officer. Under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme, routes are planned so that, in general, no pupil will have more than 3.2 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point. Furthermore, where eligible pupils attend a school at a centre other than the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live, they may be allowed the concession of transport from the catchment boundary of the centre attended, provided there are seats for them on a bus serving that centre.</P>
        <P>Having considered the distances involved to the pick-up point for the children involved, and the fact that some of the children are living outside of the catchment area concerned, my Department is satisfied that a re-routing of the bus service could not be justified in this case.</P>

	<P>Home tuition is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils with a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school on a continuing basis. In recent years home tuition has been extended as an interim support for children with a significant special educational need pending the provision of an appropriate school based educational service.</P>
        <P>My Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children, including those with special educational needs. In this regard, home tuition is only intended as an interim measure until a suitable school placement is secured. Grant approval is based on the application details of each case and a recommendation from the Department&rsquo;s professionals, if required.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, my Department has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants.</P>
        <P>The child referred to by the Deputy was in receipt of a home tuition grant while awaiting school placement. I can confirm that the pupil is now enrolled in a special school since September 2005. The pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs are being catered for in a special class for pupils with autism with a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 together with special needs assistant support. As the pupil is now in full-time education, the matter of the continuance of home tuition no longer arises. The parents were notified of this decision on 16 September 2005. The parents subsequently appealed this decision. My officials restated the Department&rsquo;s position in a letter to the parents on 24 October 2005.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides a statutory scheme of financial redress for persons who, as children, were abused while in residential institutional care. The scheme applies in respect of institutions specified in the Schedule to the Act. Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion in the Schedule of additional institutions in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P Just="Left">Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and-or solicitors regarding various institutions not specified in the Schedule. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The only facility under the aegis of my Department at the address of the centre to which the Deputy refers is a special school. Any residential centre for that school would not have been under the remit of my Department. I am not aware of an individual case regarding abuse as mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Enormous progress has been made in the funding of second level schools since 2002, the financial year indicated in the OECD report in question. The OECD report examined changes in expenditure since the mid-1990s. It shows that public expenditure on education in Ireland has increased substantially between 1995 and 2002 at all levels, even when allowing for inflation. According to data provided by the Department of Education and Science, per pupil expenditure in Ireland, at second level, has increased by 16% from &euro;5,845 in 2002, constant 2004 prices, to &euro;6,788 in 2004.</P>
        <P>Although no internationally comparable data are available for years later than 2002, the gap between expenditure here and across the OECD is likely to have narrowed further. Increased national income and public expenditure has enabled us to reduce average class size over time <Col N="1037"/>as well as increase expenditure on salaries and other areas of current expenditure.</P>
        <P>In accordance with my policy of encouraging the uptake of science and technological subjects, additional equipment grants have been provided to schools at post-primary level, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing schools building programme. In that context, &euro;16 million was provided to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
        <P>In the case of the student-teacher ratio, the figure for Ireland at second level has fallen from 15.8 in 1997-98 to 13.6 in 2003-04, which is in line with the international average. For school year, 2004/05, the student-teacher ratio was 13.4:1. Where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, the Department of Education and Science will consider applications for additional short term support. An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, there has been a significant improvement in the allocation of teachers who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second-level, there are some 1,614 wholetime equivalent wholetime teachers now in place as compared to some 558 wholetime teachers in 2001-02 school year for such pupils. The number of teaching posts allocated to schools to cater for non-national pupils with significant English language deficits has increased from 113 wholetime in 2001/02 to 249 wholetime in school year 2004/05.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department of Education and Science has provided for a further allocation of 100 posts to guidance from September 2005. I recently announced in the 2006 Estimates, of further significant increases in the level of funding for second level schools. The standard per capita grant which stood at &euro;256 per pupil in school year 2001/02 will be increased by a further &euro;12 to &euro;298 per pupil from January next. Secondary schools will also benefit, under the school services support fund initiative, from further significant increases in the support services grant. The support grant that was increased for secondary schools from &euro;131 per pupil in January last to &euro;145 per pupil, will be increased by a further &euro;14 per pupil to &euro;159 per pupil in January next. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is provided by the Department of Education and Science to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
        <P>A secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to &euro;270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to &euro;237,000 in 2002. These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of my <Col N="1038"/>commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

        <Quest>her views on whether all post-primary schools should have a laboratory technician on their staff; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Ireland is the only country in the world that does not have laboratory technicians on the staff of post primary schools; and if necessary arrangements will be put in place to approve such an appointment to each post-primary school (details supplied).</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The availability of laboratory technicians has not been a universal feature of support for science teaching in second level schools and in some countries that provide this type of resource it is confined to certain types of school. I am aware that the provision of technical assistants was one of some 39 recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences. The task force costed its proposals at a total of some &euro;244 million, of which &euro;66.3 million would be a recurring annual cost. The proposal for the provision of technical assistants would account for close to 30% of this recurring annual cost.</P>
        <P>I am keenly aware of the importance of science in a modern school curriculum and the Department of Education and Science has been very active in implementing initiatives to develop and support the teaching of the science subjects. Progress has been made on implementing 25 of the task force recommendations and the Department of Education and Science continues to progress the recommendations as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and industry. The main initiatives implemented by the Department of Education and Science in the development of the sciences include the introduction of a new science curriculum at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of &euro;1,000 per school plus &euro;10 per pupil. A revised syllabus in junior certificate science was introduced in 2003 and will be examined for the first time next June. Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics, chemistry and biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of the two remaining leaving certificate subjects, agricultural science and physics and chemistry, combined, is well advanced.</P>
        <P>The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by a comprehensive in-service programme for teachers. Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing schools building programme. <Col N="1039"/>In that context, &euro;16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised junior certificate science syllabus.</P>

	<P>Schools caretakers are employed directly by school management authorities or vocational education committees. Caretakers in vocational schools are employed and paid by the appropriate VEC. Those employed on a wholetime basis have been pensionable for many years. Those employed on a part-time basis for 18 hours per week or more have the option of joining the pension scheme, under transitional arrangements introduced in 1996.</P>
        <P>Caretakers employed on a wholetime basis in community and comprehensive schools have also been pensionable for many years. No provision has been made, as yet, for the admission to pensionability of part-time caretakers in community and comprehensive schools. In the case of voluntary secondary schools and in the case of the majority of primary schools, each school receives a grant from the Department of Education and Science for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. It is a matter for the school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. No public service pension scheme exists for caretakers employed in such schools.</P>
        <P>Under a limited scheme introduced in 1979, wholetime caretakers employed by 196 primary schools are paid salary by the Department of Education and Science. Following discussions with staff representatives, arrangements for the introduction of a pension scheme for such caretakers are currently being put in place. The question of pension cover for school staff, whether wholetime or part-time, who are not covered by an occupational pension scheme, is among the issues that fall to be considered in the context of the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-term Work) Act 2003 and the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001. Consultations with the education partners are ongoing regarding the implementation of these Acts. The question of whether a gratuity payment would be appropriate will be considered in the case of staff who, following the consultative process, remain excluded from pensionability.</P>

	<P>Arising from the provisions of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, employers are obliged to facilitate access to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, for some categories of employees in certain circumstances. The obligation arises where the employer does not operate a pension scheme, limits eligibility for membership of a scheme or imposes a waiting period for membership greater than six months from the start of employment.</P>
        <P>Employers are required to provide access for excluded employees to one or more PRSA providers. The employer is also obliged to make deductions from payroll at the excluded employee&rsquo;s request in respect of the standard PRSA administered by the provider with whom the employer has a contractual arrangement.</P>
        <P>Only a minority of school employees who are paid salary through the Department&rsquo;s payroll are excluded from membership of the pension schemes administered by the Department. The Department has, in consultation with the relevant staff representative bodies, nominated PRSA providers for such excluded staff and, at the request of the staff concerned, will make PRSA deductions from salary and pay them to the nominated provider.</P>
        <P>In the case of employees who are paid directly by school authorities or other educational institutions, the Department has advised these bodies of the obligations imposed on them in providing excluded staff with access to PRSAs. There is no obligation on an employer to make any contribution to a PRSA. Schools and other educational institutions have been advised of the position in this regard and have also been notified, in compliance with guidance issued by the Department of Finance to all Departments, that it is not envisaged that public service employers would make such a contribution.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science in respect of a decision taken by, or on behalf of, a board of management of a recognised school to permanently exclude a student from the school, suspend a student from the school for a period which would bring the cumulative period of suspension to 20 schools days in any one school year, or refuse to enrol a student in the school.</P>
        <P>In 2004, there were 263 appeals dealt with under section 29 of the Education Act 1998. In the time available it is not possible to identify how many of these appeals in 2004 involved children with special educational needs. To date in 2005, 249 appeals have been dealt with. Since early 2005, where a section 29 appeal is received on behalf of a child with special educational needs, the National Council for Special Education is notified and a special educational needs <Col N="1042"/>organiser will contact both the parent and the school in advance of the appeal hearing. The organiser is responsible for deciding what supports the school would receive on enrolling the child. The organiser will draw up a report giving the educational background to the case, detailing the special educational need, if any, and identifying the resources which would be approved were the child to attend or be readmitted to the school. In such cases the report is considered by the section 29 appeals committee in reaching a determination. There have been 26 such appeals dealt with to date in 2005. It should be noted that appeals which progress to a hearing are determined by the appeals committee based on all of the information presented and available to the committee. The issue would rarely, if ever, be as simple as whether or not the child had a special educational need.</P>
        <P>The Education Act 1998 requires all schools to have in place an admissions policy, detailing admission to and participation by students with disabilities or who have other special educational needs. The Act also requires schools to ensure, as regards that policy, the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>The Department provides a range of supports to all schools to enable them to welcome students with special educational needs. However, this requires a willingness on the part of schools to be proactive in this area and also a willingness on the part of parents to actively assert their rights in terms of their choice of school and their right to appeal where a child is refused enrolment, expelled or suspended. The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a code of behaviour detailing the circumstances under which the penalties of suspension and expulsion may be incurred.</P>

	<P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for a range of measures to assist housing authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from anti-social behaviour. Under the Act anti-social behaviour is defined to include the manufacture, production, preparation, importation, exportation, sale, supply, or distribution of a controlled drug. The Act enables a housing authority tenant or the housing authority, in certain circumstances, to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against a member of the household who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 extends the housing authority power to obtain excluding orders for anti-social behaviour to the occupants, other than the owner, of tenant purchased houses. It also gives the housing authority power to refuse to sell a house to a person it has reason to believe may engage in anti-social behaviour under the tenant purchase scheme, shared ownership scheme, affordable housing scheme and affordable houses deriving from Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P><Col N="1046"/>
        <P>In addition, housing authorities normally include provisions against anti-social behaviour in the tenancy agreement between landlord and tenants and may use powers under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 to seek an eviction of a tenant where the terms of the tenancy agreement have been breached. Good practice guidelines issued by the housing unit in December 2003 contain detailed recommendations to assist housing authorities in implementing strategies for combating anti-social behaviour.</P>

	<P>The report on the monitoring of the Ward Union hunt for the 2004-05 season compiled by Department of Agriculture and Food veterinary inspector indicated that two stags died during hunts. Both animals died following recapture: one from a ruptured pericardium and the other from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Prior to issuing a licence for the 2005-06 season, officials of my Department met rep<Col N="1047"/>resentatives of the Ward Union hunt and outlined their concerns that these fatalities occurred. The outcome was the inclusion of new conditions in the licence to improve recapture procedures and limiting recapture of the deer to when this can be done without danger to the deer.</P>

	<P>The Malin town sewerage scheme has been approved for funding in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2004-2006 under the rural towns and villages initiative. My Department approved the preliminary report for this scheme in June 2004, subject to a review of the proposed phasing of the scheme and of the water services pricing policy report which calculates the value of the contribution required from the non-domestic sector towards the capital cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Revised phasing proposals received from the council in May were approved by my Department in July 2005. The revised water services pricing policy report subsequently submitted by the council is under consideration in the Department and is being dealt with as quickly as possible. The council will be in a position to prepare contract <Col N="1048"/>documents for the scheme once the water services pricing policy report has been approved.</P>

	<P>Under section 206 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, public rights of way may be created by agreement between a planning authority and any person having the necessary power to dedicate such a right over land. Section 207 of the Act provides that, if it appears to the planning authority that there is need for a public right of way over any land, the planning authority may, by resolution, make an order creating such a right of way.</P>
        <P>These procedures for the creation of public rights of way are independent of the development plan process. However, where a planning authority proposes to include, for the first time, a provision in a development plan relating to the preservation of a specific public right of way, section 14 of the 2000 Act sets out the procedures to be followed in this regard. There are no proposals to provide specific funding to list public rights of way for inclusion in development plans.</P>

	<P>As previously indicated, Government efforts and resources, together with those of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, continue to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and improving information to householders so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>
        <P>The Government has over the years, largely through the RPII, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations. The RPII has long encouraged householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</P>
        <P>Increasing the awareness of the public is considered to be a more effective approach than the provision of State financial assistance to householders for radon testing of their homes or for radon remediation works, either of which could require significant public expenditure. Such schemes of assistance are not operated by the majority of EU member states.</P>
