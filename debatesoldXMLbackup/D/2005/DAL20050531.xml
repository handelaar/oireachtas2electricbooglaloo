        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
        <Quest>the way in which the decentralisation programme affects his Department or any agency under the aegis of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are no proposals to decentralise any section of my Department or any of the bodies or agencies operating under its aegis. A significant part of the Central Statistics Office is located in Cork. A total of 42 staff from my Department have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme. The breakdown by grade is assistant principal, six; administrative officer, nine; higher executive officer, four; executive officer, 11; staff officer, three; and clerical officer, nine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>What percentage of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s staff does that number comprise? <Col N="458" />How does it compare with other Departments? It is a high take up, given that the Taoiseach does not have a huge number of staff, apart from all the advisers and media professionals at his elbow. Have the staff been transferred? If not, when will the transfers be effected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>It is a fair number of staff. My Department is not large, employing approximately 232 staff, and 42 represents a significant proportion of the overall number. I do not have the figures for other Departments but some people are opting to leave Dublin while others, who are in the regions, are opting for other regional locations. More than 8,500 expressions of interest were received but many of those were from people in the regions seeking to move to other regional locations. The number of applicants in my Department under the programme is high and the number of applicants has increased in most Departments with the passage of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>Have many been transferred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Nobody has been transferred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>It is well over a year since decentralisation was suddenly sprung on us during the Budget Statement as an election ploy. However, it is taking a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The question refers to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>When will the desire of the 42 staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department to be transferred be effected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The staff would like to move as soon as possible but, while it is 17 months since the announcement, three separate reports have been conducted and a fourth is due. The sites on the early list have been located and the staff involved will want to move. Some of my staff move whenever vacancies arise in existing locations but few arise each year. However, every year a small number of staff is transferred. Last week a number of Departments announced the locations of their offices and the location of other sites is in train in several parts of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the staff be replaced in the Department of the Taoiseach or will staff be transferred from other areas of the Civil Service? Has a new chairman of the implementation committee been appointed? If so, who? To whom will he or she report? For example, will he or she report to a cross-departmental committee or a Minister? What reporting arrangements apply to the implementation committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>All the staff must be replaced by civil servants of a similar grade from other Departments who do not wish to decentralise. Mr. Finbarr Flood has taken over the chair of the decentralisation implementation group and <Col N="459" />reports to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>What mix of grades comprises the 42 people? Are people with skills particular to the Department of the Taoiseach being lost? Professional grades are experiencing difficulties, being told to either move &ldquo;or else&rdquo;. I do not know how people with such technical or professional skills can be accommodated elsewhere in the Civil Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The mix is composed of six assistant principal officers, nine administrative officers, four higher executive officers, 11 executive officers, three staff officers and nine clerical officers. I accept the point about the professional grades. While it is not relevant to my Department in this instance, it was when the Central Statistics Office was decentralised to Cork in June 1991. Some considerable time was spent on this issue while I was the Minister for Finance due to the professional and senior people who were relocating and I am sure this will happen again. The difficult issues must be resolved in discussion and consultation with the relevant trade unions of the elements of the professional and technical streams that wish to remain in Dublin, which is primarily IMPACT in this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
        <P>How many of the staff moving from the Department of the Taoiseach have been offered promotion? Have any departmental staff declined to move due to family, school or social contacts? In general, pressure is apparently being applied to public servants. If they move from a Department, they may achieve promotion but if they do not move, they are stuck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The situation in my Department is somewhat simpler as no section of its work is to be decentralised. No one is under pressure to leave and any who leave wish to do so. It is obviously different in other Departments. The issues relating to volunteers are being dealt with as part of the implementation process. They must be discussed and agreed with the public service unions. Possible options include redeployment to other Departments or voluntarily filling vacancies in any Dublin-based non-commercial State organisation that would otherwise be filled by open recruitment. In the case of staff who do not wish to join the Civil Service or decentralise with their current agencies, civil servants who volunteer for decentralisation could be considered to fill the vacant roles. There is a mix of ideas and options, for which the central applications facility is allowing. It has not been difficult for anyone in my Department who has left to be promoted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
        <P>I listened carefully and with interest to what the Taoiseach had to say. When he mentioned that 42 staff from his Department are offering to decentralise, is this a reduction in <Col N="460" />numbers on the reply he gave the House in February when I noted the number of staff as 45? That amounts to approximately 20% of his Department. Does the Taoiseach expect an increase or further decrease in this number? In his Department&rsquo;s monthly report to the Cabinet on its own decentralisation process, has the timetable for implementation changed in light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s experiences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That does not arise in this context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
        <P>I am referring to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s experience in his Department. I understand that the Ceann Comhairle is strict in these matters so I am endeavouring not to stray from the salient point, even though it is tempting to do so. I ask about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own Department and the implementation group under Mr. Finbarr Flood. Does the Taoiseach deem the costs to his Department to include reimbursements to staff for relocating? A precedent may have been set in the case of Teagasc staff who moved to Carlow and were given a &euro;15,000 commuting payment. Does the Taoiseach consider that a payment such as that would apply to his staff or would it become part of the &euro;90 million total cost of decentralisation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>There is no payment system in place and any questions arising on that issue will be discussed with the trade unions. There is no scheme at present and I do not envisage one being set up. I do not have the figure for transfer applications for February, but if Deputy Sargent maintains that it is 45, the explanation is that there are always a number of people in any Department who are moving anyway. They are on lists for relocation or decentralisation. I know of an individual in my Department, for example, who has just moved to Cork.</P>
        <P>In terms of final numbers, the central applications facility list is still open and people in various Departments are moving on and off that list all the time. It would not remain the same. People change their minds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain">
        <NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
        <P>Is there a Cabinet sub-committee dealing with decentralisation? If there is no such sub-committee, would the Taoiseach consider putting one in place, given the complexities of what is proposed within his Department and in all other Departments, especially in the context of the crossover between Departments whereby people will seek relocation and, therefore, transfer between Departments. Is there an individual in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department charged with liaising with other Departments regarding the overall decentralisation project? If there is no Cabinet sub-committee dealing with this issue, can the Taoiseach indicate how the overall programme is being co-ordinated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="461" />
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>At the outset there was a Cabinet sub-committee dealing with the issues, composed mainly of personnel from the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works as well as a number of other relevant Departments. Since the decentralisation implementation group was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Finbarr Flood, it has been co-ordinating the project and dealing with various Ministers. Property acquisitions and related issues are being dealt with by the Office of Public Works. Staffing issues are being dealt with by the personnel management, PSMD, section of the Department of Finance, while a separate group is dealing with the senior officials who are moving. The Secretary General of my Department is involved with that senior personnel group. They are the main elements that are driving and co-ordinating the decentralisation project.</P>
        <P>The implementation group publishes progress reports periodically. There were three such reports last year and another one is due this summer.</P>

        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on Aer Lingus last met on 9 December 2004 and there are no arrangements for it to meet again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government has announced a decision to put our national airline into the hands of speculators. I find this decision incredible. Can the Taoiseach explain why the Cabinet sub-committee on the national airline has not met since December 2004? Can he tell me where the privatisation of Aer Lingus was discussed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>It is not possible to have a debate on a matter covered by Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>Is it then possible to ask about the methods used by the Cabinet to arrive at decisions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>It is not possible to do so arising from these questions. Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s <Col N="462" />question is purely statistical and poses a problem for the Chair, as it does for the Deputy. It would be better if these questions were submitted to the line Minister who would be in a position to deal with policy issues. This is a purely statistical question and it does not allow latitude to the Chair or the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>We should change the system because I will stop attending Taoiseach&rsquo;s Question Time if it is reduced to an irrelevancy. Maybe the Taoiseach would not mind that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I am merely rising on the narrow point that whatever it is, it is not a statistical question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
        <P>On a point of order, while the Chair is interpreting the rules and I respect his ruling, can he tell me why a question similar to the other questions I posed was ruled out of order because it apparently contained the phrase &ldquo;and if the Taoiseach will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;? The Taoiseach made a very curt statement on the matter and I cannot understand why my question was ruled out of order as it was as narrowly focused as the other questions, except that it contained the phrase I have just quoted. Surely, the Chair&rsquo;s ruling that the question was out of order overstepped the mark and the question should have been allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Normally, I would not discuss matters of this nature on the floor of the House. I would instead deal with it in the office. However, I studied Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question yesterday and it asked for a report of the meeting of the sub-committee, rather than just asking the Taoiseach to make a statement on the matter. These questions refer specifically to the date of the sub-committee meeting. Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question asked for a report on what was discussed at the meeting; that could not be allowed.</P>

        <P>I wish to finish my question. Does the Taoiseach accept that we find it incredible that a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on Aer Lingus has not taken place since December 2004, given that such an enormous decision to privatise a national airline has been taken? Will the Taoiseach scotch the rumour that a grubby deal was brokered between himself and the Irish Congress of Trades Unions that secured ICTU&rsquo;s toleration of the privatisation of Aer Lingus in return for the public ownership of the new terminal at Dublin Airport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That question does not arise. The Taoiseach on the first question on the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Regarding the first question, all the matters after that were dealt with by the full Cabinet. The Minister for Transport made it clear to the House last week that he and the Minister for Finance will move quickly to appoint advisers and deal with the issues. This was dealt with at the Cabinet. There is no need for the sub-committee. It had a job to do and it dealt with it. The matter has moved on and the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance are dealing with it.</P>

        <P>I will respond briefly. The Minister for Finance has moved to appoint advisers to advise on the size, type and timing of the sale.

The timing for proceeding will be decided in conjunction with the board.</P>

        <P>Given that the Cabinet sub-committee on Aer Lingus has not met during 2005 and that the Cabinet made the decision on Aer Lingus and Dublin Airport a fortnight ago, what function does the Cabinet sub-committee on Aer Lingus perform? What relevance does it have? Does the Taoiseach envisage it having a role in the future? Will it have a function in implementing the Cabinet decision to sell the State&rsquo;s majority shareholding in Aer Lingus? Will its deliberations be brought before the Cabinet and, whatever decision is arrived at and by whatever vehicle, will they be brought before the House before being processed? Did the plan for Aer Lingus and Dublin Airport emanate from the Cabinet sub-committee on Aer Lingus? Did the sub-committee have any deliberations on this matter, either at its December 2004 meeting or at earlier meetings? Is it the case, as the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response suggests, that it has no relevance to the issue and its central <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>?</P>

        <P>The Deputy must understand that a Cabinet committee is sometimes established to deal with a particular aspect of a decision. In this case, it dealt with a Goldman Sachs&rsquo; report and related issues. As soon as that issue was dealt with, the committee ended. The Cabinet dealt with everything else.

        <P>I am very interested in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply. As 9 December 2004 is given as the date of the final meeting, I wonder whether any business was conducted at the meeting other than a Christmas drink. Was it envisaged that the sub-committee would need to meet again in any form? Was it envisaged that it would address the question of why the Government seems ideologically opposed to investing in Aer Lingus, although it is investing in so many other airlines through the national pensions reserve fund?</P>
        <P>Is there a need to revisit this issue? The Taoiseach should indicate that the sub-committee should meet again, perhaps in conjunction with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to ascertain where money is being invested on behalf of the <Col N="467" />taxpayer in airlines other than Aer Lingus, including Ryanair, and why Aer Lingus seems to be regarded as not worthy of investment but of being sold off to whatever sharks will try to make money out of it. The sub-committee needs to meet again as its work is far from finished, and it has left a very unfortunate legacy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, are you telling the House that when the Taoiseach tells us that this decision was taken in Cabinet &mdash; the Government acting qua government &mdash; we may not ask the Head of Government about the decision in question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy is well aware of what one is allowed to ask. This was a statistical question. It asked for the date of a meeting and that is all it asked. The Chair cannot allow questions that are not on the Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Since questions began to be asked in the House, one is permitted to put so much into a question and it is no more than a peg to set out why one is seeking to extract information from Government. With respect, it has never been judged in the restrictive fashion in which you are judging this question. To describe a question about Aer Lingus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
        <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The question is quite specific. If we were to do what the Deputy wishes, the Taoiseach would answer for every line Minister at Taoiseach&rsquo;s Question Time. A Deputy could put down a question on anything discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee and have a full debate on it for three-quarters of an hour. That has never been the position in this House. I act in accordance with the actions of my predecessors. All questions are scrutinised coming in to the office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
        <P>On a point of order, that is not necessarily true. I and others have recent experience of line Ministers refusing to answer a ques<Col N="468" />tion and it being disallowed and referred to the Department of the Taoiseach. We have also had recent experience of tabling a question to a line Minister who refused to answer the question on the basis of not being responsible to the House and having the Minister to whom it was referred return it unanswered on the basis that it was not his or her responsibility to answer. There are issues which must be dealt with.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
        <P>I accept that. However, the Ceann Comhairle should examine the matter carefully because questions arise. Today&rsquo;s Order Paper contains questions which have been referred to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council has completed its study entitled A Developmental Welfare State, which was published on 19 May. The council completed its report, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, in December 2004 and will complete a report on the Lisbon Agenda in the coming months, focusing on the open method of co-ordination. It will also undertake its three-yearly strategic overview of Irish economic and social policy, paving the way to negotiations on a successor to Sustaining Progress. Other studies in the council work programme include migration policy, child poverty and child income supports, Ireland&rsquo;s first periodic social report, the taxation system in the medium term, competition regulation in the network sectors and a report on innovation foresight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>The work programme for the National Economic and Social Council for 2003 to 2006 provided for nine reports on significant issues. The Taoiseach indicated that the council has completed reports on social welfare and housing, which I did not see on the original list, as well as one other. The council seems to be slow in coming forward with its reports. What is the status of some of the other planned reports, particularly that on migration policy, which would appear quite urgent, and the taxation system in the medium term? Is there a timescale for these and the remaining reports which formed part of the work programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The council will complete the report on the Lisbon strategy and the open method of co-ordination over the next number of months. It is undertaking its three-yearly strategic overview of the Irish economy and social policy, which is a large report and is used as the basis for negotiations on the three-year programmes. I do not have dates for the other reports. The council is working on migration policy, child poverty and child income supports and the periodic social report. The report on the taxation system in the medium term is nearing completion. I do not have dates for the reports on competition regulation in network systems or on innovation foresight, but most of the work is ongoing at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach expand on the process that is followed when the NESC makes a report on a particular subject? Is the report left lying ignored on a shelf or is there a structured process that takes account of the findings, recommendations and thinking in such a report? How is it imported into public policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The process is that when it is passed by the NESC it is cleared by the Government. In the case of most reports there would be a discussion at that stage by Government. They would then go to the relevant Department or Departments. Taxation reports would go to the <Col N="470" />Department of Finance and education reports to the Department of Education and Science. The reports on the broad economy and social policy cover a number of Ministries and usually would be used as the basis for the talks process &mdash; practically every Department is involved in that. In some cases Departments recommend legislation. Other times it is included in social welfare Bills and other legislation. It is normal for Departments to report back on the process. In many cases, as in the national infrastructure reports, they may attend some of the Cabinet sub-committee meetings and discussions would be held on some of the issues. That is where they have done work for the process, as they did for the national plan. That would not take place in the case of a normal report but only if they had done work on it. Other reports on improvement of services are followed up by the relevant Department.</P>
        <P>In the normal course of events &mdash; I cannot say without exception &mdash; there is an active link between the NESC work and the Departments. A number of Departments would use it for the basis of much of their own action because they see it as work that helps them, such as the developmental welfare state report, which I am aware is being actively examined and was the source of a conference held some weeks ago attended by people from many Departments and agencies. They will now deal with their own aspects of the report and there is normally follow up on those.</P>

That report states that the welfare state by EU standards uses a moderate to low proportion of national resources in providing services and a low proportion in providing cash transfers. It goes on to state that some of that is due to sections of the Irish population not enjoying the standards of social protection which their counterparts in other countries enjoy. Does the Taoiseach agree with that conclusion of the report? Does he agree that despite being one of the richest countries economically in the world, we remain one of the most unequal countries? Does he concede that, as the NESC points out, the high level of means-testing puts this country&rsquo;s social welfare system in the shade when compared to a number of those of our European counterparts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not agree it is unequal. There are countries in Europe that are high contributors to the social welfare system. If we look at the charts and compare what we pay and what we fund, we would be termed a high contributor but not high in terms of the taxation level. It is correct that means tests apply to many issues.</P>
        <P>I cannot comment on the detail of the other point, although I attended the launch of the report and spoke on it. The report provides a revised account of where the Irish welfare system has come from and identifies that social deficits remain, despite the remarkable progress we have made. It recasts the social debate in such a way <Col N="471" />as to build consensus in terms of trying to improve the system for the future. That is what it endeavours to do. It highlights the existing deficits and areas where we could be more fair and reasonable. The T&aacute;naiste has picked up on some of these already in the method of social care provision and disposable income. That issue moves away from the strict barrier of the means-tested arrangements and other countries use such a method.</P>
        <P>A number of themes are identified, namely, that we should bring the same determination and innovation to social policy as we did to economic success. That is something with which I agree. If we put in the same effort we will remove many of the inequalities that exist in the system. We have done a great deal of that over recent years, such as the pre-1953 social insurance scheme. This was a major problem that has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>The report also highlights improvements in services as the single most important route to enhancing social protection. It also deals with many of the profit and non-profit sectors. It sets out a scope and it is to feed into the social partnership process, to examine some of these areas, and to feed into the social welfare process. It is a very useful report in that it considers the deficits as well as the positive aspects of the country. I accept there are deficits and these are highlighted in the report.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the reason for his decision to revamp the State&rsquo;s employment rights system and review labour legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>Since the setting up of the Labour Court almost 60 years ago, structures and systems have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner to the extent that there are now seven bodies and 25 Acts operating <Col N="472" />in the employment rights and industrial relations area. The evolution of a large body of employment rights legislation has led to the current system, which can be complex and costly, with duplication of functions as well as divergences in procedures and remedies.</P>
        <P>Arising out of a commitment in the programme for Government 2002-07, a review group on the functions of the employment rights bodies was established. This was the first ever review of the role and relationships of the employment rights bodies and their adjudication and enforcement frameworks. On 24 May I announced that the Government had agreed a programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group and my subsequent consultations with the various interested parties. I am confident the programme of action will improve considerably the levels of customer service that the various employment rights bodies can offer to those using the dispute resolution services. It will also facilitate the simplification and modernisation of procedures, providing greater transparency and ease of access.</P>
        <P>The consolidation of the large corpus of legislation in this area, when coupled with the legislative proposals emerging from the work of the employment rights group which is to be established, will enhance the coherence and user-friendliness of the employment rights adjudication and enforcement system and be of benefit to all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>Why has the Minister decided to proceed with the review at this juncture, and from where did the initial suggestion come? What was the original source of the suggestion that this review was necessary, notwithstanding that it was in the programme for Government 2002-07? There is not universal approval from all practitioners in the field, nor is there full agreement on the process by which the Minister is proceeding. What is the precise problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>None of us would expect to get full approval. When I was appointed seven or eight months ago one of the first documents I received concerned the recommendation arising from the review group. I held consultations with representatives of the various bodies concerned and with the social partners. There was not complete support for the proposals and there was concern about the next phase, the proposed setting up of an implementation group. In view of that I sought to have an independent assessment of the initial reports carried out. This was done by the former Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Kevin Bonner, who also carried out consultations with the bodies involved and made some changes to the initial recommendations.</P>
        <P>At this stage, they command a considerable level of support. The initial reason for establishing the review group was the strong belief that considerable difficulty is experienced by people who have to access the system due to the fact that <Col N="473" />there are seven bodies and 25 pieces of legislation. Complications arise from that position, including cost factors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>One of the bodies charged with implementing the legislation is the Employment Appeals Tribunal. I have received correspondence from the chairman of that tribunal, Ms Kate T. O&rsquo;Mahony, stating: &ldquo;The proposed change, if implemented, would have far reaching effects, would downgrade the rights of dismissed employees, and relegate Ireland to the lower echelons among the European member states in terms of its protection of its employment rights.&rdquo; How does the Minister of State reconcile those comments from the chairman of the Employment Appeals Tribunal with what he is proposing to do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by Deputy Hogan and I am also aware that there are many divergent views on this matter. Nevertheless, the overarching concern of Government must be to ensure that the system is fair and accessible to everybody at reasonable cost. The proposals arising from the review by Mr. Bonner are considerably more acceptable to many of the bodies than had been the case with the original proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>Some time ago there was a recommendation to abolish the Employment Appeals Tribunal and deal directly with such cases through a rights commissioner at the Labour Court. Does the Minister of State agree, however, that a one-stop-shop mechanism might be more appropriate to deal with all these issues, rather than the half-way house recommended in Mr. Bonner&rsquo;s report? If the Minister of State is so concerned about rationalisation of the Act and the procedure, why is he retaining all the various existing layers, including the rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>There are two elements to the proposal, one of which is consolidation of the legislation. It is an important job, which, I understand, will take 18 months to two years. It is worth doing in any event. The original proposal was for the amalgamation of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court, but it did not find a lot of favour. Following Mr. Bonner&rsquo;s review, it was felt that a more appropriate mechanism would be to refer cases in the first instance to a rights commissioner and, subsequently, on appeal, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate. That system serves the function of which Deputy Hogan extols the value, effectively providing a one-stop-shop for the person initiating a claim. It brings considerably more clarity to the entire system.</P>

        <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s views on the recently published report of the consumer strategy group; the reason he has decided to embark on another consultation process in regard to below-cost selling; when this process will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[18119/05]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government welcomes the report of the consumer strategy group which was published on 18 May 2005. The report contains over 30 separate recommendations involving a variety of Departments and agencies. The Government accepts the core recommendation in the CSG report and has approved, in principle, the establishment of a new national consumer agency.</P>
        <P>The Government intends to ensure that the new agency is up and running as soon as possible and to that end my Department has commenced the necessary legislative and organisational work to establish the NCA. In the interim, I am appointing a board to the new agency, which will act in an interim capacity until the NCA is established on a statutory footing. The interim board will immediately begin planning for the final structure and organisation of the fully-fledged national consumer agency.</P>
        <P>As regards the other recommendations contained in the CSG report, the Government has agreed to establish a high level interdepartmental committee to examine the recommendations and to report back with a detailed implementation plan within three months.</P>
        <P>One of the group&rsquo;s recommendations &mdash; the proposal that the groceries order be abolished entirely &mdash; has, not unexpectedly attracted a significant amount of interest. This is an important recommendation both for business and consumer interests. The issues to which the groceries order give rise are complex. The CSG report, while coming down in favour of the revocation of the groceries order in its entirety, also recognises that there is well-founded argumentation on both sides of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The report advances new material and arguments in support of its recommendation to revoke the order. It is also the first time since the groceries order was first introduced in the 1950s that its operation has been examined from a uniquely consumer perspective. It is only sensible and prudent policy-making to give all those with an interest in the matter the opportunity to comment on the CSG findings.</P>
        <P>In all those circumstances, I decided that careful and serious consideration of the CSG arguments and recommendation was warranted before deciding what action would be appropriate on the order. Accordingly, I decided to invite the views of all interested parties, not just on the recommendation to revoke the order but also on what, if anything, should replace the order.</P>
        <Col N="475" />
        <P>The consultation process is under way and submissions are invited before 31 July 2005. Following this consultation period, I will take all views into account before deciding what action is appropriate. In the event that it is decided to change the status of the order, primary legislation will be needed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>We now know the views of virtually everyone in the country, except the Minister, on the groceries order. We know the views of the Oireachtas committee, Opposition Deputies who spoke on it and the consumer strategy group. We have not, however, heard the views of the Minister who has responsibility for this matter. Does the Minister accept that he has garnered for himself in a number of Departments a reputation for always being a report away from a hard decision? Will he tell the House his thoughts and views on the value or otherwise of maintaining the groceries order?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Not at all, I have an open mind on this matter. There is a number of factors to take on board, not least the interests of consumers, which is a key issue. There are also the issues of primary producers, suppliers and the impact on industry. I will allow the consultation process to take place. The consumer strategy group has advanced cogent arguments. Those who are opposed to the revocation of the order will have to come up with strong arguments on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>I feel a compromise coming up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>We will have to respond in a meaningful way to the points that have been raised by the consumer strategy group, not least that, to date, everyone has concentrated on the revocation of the order only. There are other issues that the CSG raised which deserve serious consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Hogan is right to say that there is a compromise brewing. Does the Minister accept that the groceries order involves a uniquely consumer perspective or does he accept that the order also involves other vital perspectives, such as good planning? Does the Minister agree with the consumer strategy group&rsquo;s recommendation that local authorities should interpret the retail planning guidelines in a manner that promotes competition and that is consistent across all local authority areas? Alternatively, would the Minister share my view that different interpretations might be more appropriate for different locations?</P>
        <P>The needs of cities such as Dublin, Cork or Galway are different from those of towns like Wexford, Mullingar and Tralee. Therefore, the best interpretation of what is appropriate to maintain the heart of towns and accessible shopping precincts is better understood by the local <Col N="477" />community. That is why we have the concept of local government, as opposed to centralised Government, to make planning decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I am glad the Deputy has acknowledged that there are other perspectives to the groceries order issue. I initiated the consultation process to allow those other perspectives to have an input into future decisions on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>On the point the Deputy raised concerning planning, I agree with the consumer strategy group&rsquo;s broad recommendation that planning authorities should not impede competition and should never utilise planning as a vehicle for impeding competition. On behalf of the State and the Oireachtas, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issues planning guidelines on a range of issues. The Oireachtas often concurs with the issuing to all local authorities of broad guidelines which could relate to social housing, housing in general, the retail area and so on. While local considerations must be considered, planning should never be used as a way to stop competition.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he has taken and intends to take to address the serious unemployment levels in Carrick-on-Suir; the steps which have been taken by the industrial agencies to bring industry to the town, including the number of site visits to the town by these agencies for prospective industrialists; and if he will establish a jobs task force to address the jobs crisis in the town.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Support for job creation and investment on a regional or local basis comes within the remit of the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, which is actively marketing individual areas as a location for additional foreign direct investment, and Enterprise Ireland, which concentrates on the development of indigenous industries, with the 35 city and county enterprise boards having primary responsibility for the regional promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector. Under the Industrial Development Acts, I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland but I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>The latest quarterly household survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 2 March 2005 shows that the unemployment rate in the south east was 5.6%. While this figure is above the national average, which is now down to<?oasys _jy?>4.3%, it is a significant decrease on the figure in the previous quarterly household survey which <Col N="478" />showed unemployment at 6.2% in the region. In addition, the numbers on the live register in south Tipperary fell from 3,733 in April 2004 to 3,275 in April 2005. The corresponding figures for Carrick-on-Suir show a reduction from 942 to 914, which reflects a positive trend.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is assisting those who are unemployed to join or re-enter the labour force by offering skills analysis, training and retraining programmes and a job placement service. A full-time local employment service office operates in Carrick-on-Suir. F&Aacute;S also sponsors a jobs club in the enterprise centre in the town. This latter initiative is aimed at increasing the skills levels of those concerned. The agency also works closely with the Carrick-on-Suir RAPID steering committee. RAPID is a special designation project for areas of high deprivation aimed at establishing innovative actions which aid growth and social and economic inclusion in the designated areas.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland supports two overseas companies in Carrick-on-Suir. While it has not hosted any recent site visits by prospective investors to Carrick-on-Suir, there have been 11 such visits to the surrounding area in the past 12 months. However, ultimately it is the investor who decides where to locate a project, including what areas to visit as potential locations. The announcement in May 2004 by Guidant Corporation of a 1,000-person job expansion at its Clonmel plant should have considerable knock-on benefits in terms of other investment and employment opportunities for people in the immediate vicinity and surrounding areas, including those living in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, EI, also continues to promote job creation in south Tipperary. Its job creation activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and on enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. In the past three years, EI made payments of more than &euro;4.5 million to client companies in south Tipperary to assist them with development projects.</P>
        <P>Since its inception, the Tipperary South Riding County Enterprise Board, CEB, has assisted 40 micro-enterprises in the Carrick-on-Suir area and has provided more than &euro;448,000 in grant assistance resulting in the creation of 67 jobs in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing direct financial assistance, the Tipperary South Riding CEB also provides non-financial assistance such as advice, mentoring and a broad range of training programmes which are beneficial to either prospective entrants or established participants in the micro-enterprise sector. In the period since 1993, a total of 110 people from the Carrick-on-Suir area have participated in a range of management develop<Col N="479" />ment courses held by the Tipperary South Riding CEB in Carrick-on-Suir, including courses in starting a business, web design, front office skills and information technology training. In addition, enterprises from Carrick-on-Suir have also participated in courses run in other areas of the region such as Clonmel. Any further initiatives in job creation should be addressed at local level in co-operation with the county development board where the industrial development agencies are already involved. This would be in line with the position adopted in other areas of the country.</P>

        <P>It appears from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that he can tell us what is happening everywhere except in Carrick-on-Suir. He has told us the position in south Tipperary and in the south east generally. It seems the Minister will not accept that a persistently high level of unemployment in the town of Carrick-on-Suir is serious or indicates a crisis. Since the Government came to power in 1997, an unemployment problem of this magnitude has existed in Carrick-on-Suir. It is a town of 5,000 people with more than 900 unemployed. That represents an unemployment rate of close to 20%, close to four times the national average &mdash; a million miles away from 5.6%, or indeed 6.2%, in the south east. Does the Minister accept that this is a serious situation and that regardless of whatever has happened in the south east or in south Tipperary, a particular problem regarding unemployment and job creation exists in Carrick-on-Suir? As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister has a responsibility to ensure that every area gets its fair share of investment and job creation. As Carrick-on-Suir has persisted as a blackspot area in this regard, would it be opportune for the Minister to establish a task force for the town to ensure that it avails of job creation and investment?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not wish to be adversarial, but the surest way of turning foreign direct investment away from an area is to label it a blackspot. Anything I said in my reply did not understate any difficulties there may be in Carrick-on-Suir in terms of creating employment. If we want to attract foreign direct investment to a particular location, we should avoid headlines or titles using the term &ldquo;blackspot&rdquo; because that does nothing for the area and nothing to enhance its prospects for attracting jobs and employment.</P>
        <P>The south east is relevant. Everything I said in the reply is relevant because it impacts on Carrick-on-Suir. Between 2005 and 2010, IDA Ireland will bring 1,000 jobs to Clonmel, jobs which are just beginning to arrive. It is ridiculous to suggest that the success of IDA Ireland in attracting an investment of that size and quality to Clonmel, which is about 14 miles from Carrick-on-Suir, will not have an impact on Carrick-on-Suir&rsquo;s unemployment figures. It defies logic.</P>

        <P>I suggest to the Deputy that in the context of the Guidant Corporation investment or other investments in the area, the State agencies, in particular F&Aacute;S, the training agencies and the Tipperary Institute, should look at ways in which we can ensure that a significant proportion of the population in Carrick-on-Suir is in a position to access the jobs bring created in companies like Guidant. I will work with the Deputy, local interests and the State agencies to see if we can ensure that this happens. Through F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland and the country enterprise board, we will continue to work on training and education to achieve a higher work participation rate in employment for people living in Carrick-on-Suir, and to build more employment to the area, either through indigenous companies, by attracting new companies or expanding the facilities in companies already located in the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 265 together.</P>
        <P>While centrally, the better regulation issue is being driven by the Department of the Taoiseach and the better regulation group, I support any initiative aimed at keeping to a minimum the administrative and regulatory burdens on small business in Ireland. The Taoiseach launched the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on better regulation <Col N="481" />in January 2004 which sets out Government policies and an action plan for improving the quality of regulation as well as the regulatory process in the coming years. Many of the provisions in the White Paper replicate the approach being taken at EU level and in other member states.</P>
        <P>As the primary regulator of business and of the workforce, my Department is well aware of the need for the best possible regulation as well as the continuing need for lighter and more focused laws. In this regard I am anxious to ensure that my Department&rsquo;s activities in reforming existing legislation and introducing new legislation conform with the principles of better regulation as set out in the White Paper. I am also aware of the recent report prepared for the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which recommended a proactive approach to reducing regulation in the economy and that some consideration should be given to adopting an approach whereby specific targets would be set for reducing regulation within a specified timeframe. My Department is considering its response to this report.</P>
        <P>While there is merit in monitoring the better regulation agenda in the Netherlands and in other member states, that is a matter for all Departments to take on board, and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, which convenes the better regulation co-ordinating group, can assist that process across Government and regulatory bodies. My Department will assist that process with a view to reducing regulatory burdens, where possible. The best way forward is through implementing the specific actions set out in the Government White paper. I have instituted a review and regulatory impact analysis of the directors&rsquo; compliance statement at section 45 of the Companies Act 2003. In addition, my Department is currently engaged in a number of other projects designed to improve the current regulatory environment, including the fundamental restructuring, consolidation and reform of existing company law; the modernisation of consumer legislation, with a view to producing a single modern Act to replace the broad set of legislation currently in force; a new safety, health and welfare at work Bill, which will set a new health and safety legal code for the next ten to 15 years; and the restatement of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-1993, which will include all amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Acts in an up to date document.</P>
        <P>The Government has agreed a programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies, which includes the harmonisation and consolidation of business employment rights legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>It is precisely because the Taoiseach launched the document on better regulation in January 2004, but did nothing since that I asked this question. It is all very fine for the Minister to stand here and say what is in the <Col N="482" />Government White Paper. We know what is in it, but nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>The Minister stands accused of imposing additional regulatory burdens on small businesses in recent years. The fact that he has acknowledged there is a problem means he, as part of the Government, has been somewhat responsible for some of these additional regulatory burdens on small businesses. In light of the problem in terms of the regulatory burden on small businesses in particular, will he set a target for the Government to reduce the administrative and legislative burdens in the same way as the Dutch Government did?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not accept that nothing has been done. I have already outlined the programme of work under my Department, which dovetails with the recommendations of the White Paper, in particular the consolidation and simplification of existing legislation dating back over a long period. We are codifying, consolidating and simplifying that legislation for the benefit of those who come under its ambit.</P>
        <P>I do not have a difficulty with the thrust of the Deputy&rsquo;s position. I intend to look at the area of small business and micro-enterprise specifically. In that context I can take on board the regulatory burden on small business in particular and the best ways to effect a reduction of that and make a proper evaluation of its impact on our competitiveness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister was warned about the compliance statement and the difficulties it would have for directors when the legislation was going through the Oireachtas, but he chose to bulldoze his way through this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">

        <P>I was not in the Department then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>I know that, but I understand corporate governance still holds, although I am not sure about that at times. I am glad the Minister agrees with the report of the Oireachtas committee on this occasion although he may not have the same agreement with Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s questions on another Oireachtas committee report. In the Oireachtas committee report, in advance of the Minister&rsquo;s thinking on the issue &mdash; in order to prod him along &mdash; we have set the route towards ensuring that there will be less regulation and a more benign environment for small businesses. Will the Minister agree to come before the Oireachtas committee at the earliest opportunity to discuss the contents of that report and to respond as quickly as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Which report does the Deputy mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business report. Will he come to the committee to tease out some of the difficulties small businesses have before he comes to any conclusions with his company law review <Col N="483" />group on the review currently going on in his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Given the respect I have for the Oireachtas committee and the appreciation I have of its view, I will gladly discuss that issue with it, subject to commitments. However, I will ensure I do it before the recess.</P>
        <P>The review of the compliance directive is a good example of Government listening rather than ploughing ahead. Collectively the Government has taken the decision to listen to what people have said on this. There is a fine balance to be struck in dealing with this. On any day here Deputies jump up and down if something breaks with regard to banking or some scandal emerges. People say we need accountability and compliance, which we do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>This difficulty is not about big businesses and corporations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>We are trying to strike a balance between accountability, good governance and good behaviour on the one hand and on the other, a flexible business-friendly environment that allows people get on and be productive and efficient. The country has a good reputation for the latter, which is important in terms of the attraction of foreign direct investment, particularly in key sectors of the economy where we have been successful in bringing in international mobile investment into the country. We do not want to undermine our capacity to do that into the future and our decision to review the legislation is part of that. The Minister of State in the Department will deal with the company law review and I will alert him to the Deputy&rsquo;s feelings on the matter.</P>

        <QRef>[18381/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>In February this year my Department published a paper on the electricity market as part of the Department&rsquo;s policy to highlight competitiveness issues. The paper was written from an enterprise policy perspective and is intended as a contribution to the elaboration of an overall national energy policy.</P>
        <P>With regard to the electricity market, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural resources has initiated a review of the electricity market sector. This review will examine the institutional arrangements and market structures and assess their appropriateness. The impetus for this review stems from the perceived difficulties relating to the ESB&rsquo;s dominance and the need to attract new entrants and develop competition in <Col N="484" />the sector. The paper prepared by my Department will contribute to this review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his response. One of the key findings of the Department&rsquo;s report was that the ESB&rsquo;s market share in electricity generation should reach a 60% market share by 2005, but currently its share stands at 83% of the market. If current trends are maintained, by 2007 its market share will still be around 75%. Is the Minister in discussion with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Taoiseach and his predecessor in the Department, on this matter with regard to competitiveness and related issues?</P>
        <P>With regard to the nuts and bolts of the effect of the lack of competition in the electricity market, we have seen a change of situation from the mid-1990s, ten years ago, where Ireland had among the lowest electricity prices for industry in Europe to a position where, for the past five years, we are among the three highest in Europe; only Italy and Cyprus are higher. In terms of competitiveness this is felt most markedly among the food and beverage, the pharmachem and electronic sectors of industry, which are responsible for more than half the money spent by industry on energy costs, even though they are the mainstay of employment here and are responsible for more than three-quarters of the gross value added of goods produced here. On those terms, is the Minister seeking to initiate a Cabinet debate on the issue? What legal mechanisms exist, for him or the Government, to bring the ESB in line with what is a voluntary commitment on its part in reaching a 60% market share by this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The document my Department produced is a contribution to the debate and, in particular, to the review the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has initiated. My Department has no responsibility for how the market is structured, how it evolved or how it can be reformed and developed. Control of these issues has been transferred to an independent energy regulator and that must be accepted. Also, in terms of the strategic developments in the market, EU directives govern that development.</P>
        <P>That said, our concern and that of Government is the impact on competitiveness. The Deputy is correct to draw attention to the deteriorating competitiveness position in terms of energy pricing that we have witnessed over the past five or six years. There are counter arguments as to why this happened. Various arguments have been put forward by the ESB and others citing, for example, the historic under investment in both the generating and transmission infrastructure over a 20 or 30 year period. That is one argument cited for the rapid investment in recent times. The ESB has been trying to ensure that capacity is at a level that meets the significant rise in demand that has occurred as a result of the very <Col N="485" />dramatic growth in the economy over the past five or six years.</P>
        <P>We are conscious that the cost of electricity for an Irish industrial user is approximately 40% above that of a similar UK firm. That is a matter of serious concern to the Government. It is obvious the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources had that clearly within his sights when he initiated the review. He is conscious of the concerns. It is obvious the members of the Government work collectively and coherently on issues of this nature, which are of national importance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
        <P>I accept that the Minister&rsquo;s role does not involve making decisions on how the electricity market is structured. However, I would like him to express his opinion on whether the 60% target can be achieved. Is there a need for specific legal mechanisms to help to meet the target? Is the Minister prepared to discuss the need for such mechanisms with his Government colleagues? All we have received from the ESB is a voluntary commitment. Not only do we need reviews of this nature so that debate can be generated, but we also need the Government to make decisions on the measures needed to bring about this eventuality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I think I have answered the Deputy&rsquo;s query. Given that the current rate is 83%, it is clear that we are nowhere near achieving the target, which involves the ESB having a 60% share of the electricity generation market. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has initiated a comprehensive review to ascertain whether we can add new elements to the existing infrastructure and policy framework and free up the market to an increased extent. The initiatives taken &mdash; we have appointed an independent energy regulator, for example &mdash; have not resulted in reduced prices.</P>

        <Quest>the specific reasons for the State&rsquo;s failure to ratify the UN convention on the rights of migrant workers and their families.</Quest>
        <QRef>[18093/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The State, through its employment rights legislation, is committed to the protection of migrant workers&rsquo; rights. All workers in Ireland receive the full protection of Irish employment law, which reflects the wider EU social protection framework. Like all other EU member states, Ireland has not signed and is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990. It seems <Col N="486" />that significant changes will be needed across a wide range of existing legislation if the convention, which has been examined by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is to be ratified. The legislation in question relates to authorisation to stay and to work, education, training and integration, family reunification, social security, transfer of income and taxation, housing, health and medical care and electoral matters. Such changes would have implications for Ireland&rsquo;s relations with its EU partners and possibly for the operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK. There are no plans to introduce such changes, which would be necessary before Ireland could ratify or consider signing the convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that Ireland&rsquo;s failure to ratify the convention is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s lack of commitment to protecting the rights of migrant workers? Does he accept that the failure to sign the convention sends a message to employers about the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area? While the law does not discriminate between migrant workers and other workers, recent evidence clearly shows than many employers engage in such discrimination. We need to offer specific protection to migrant workers for that reason. Can the Minister outline the nature of the risk to the common travel area between Ireland and the UK that might arise if Ireland signs the convention?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not agree that Ireland&rsquo;s failure to ratify the convention demonstrates that the Government is not committed to protecting the rights of migrant workers. The Government is very committed to defending such rights. Irish labour law which is among the most progressive bodies of labour legislation in Europe, protects everybody who comes to this country to work legally.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I will not discuss that aspect of the matter as it relates to everybody involved, including the social partners. I do not accept that a message of the kind suggested by Deputy Morgan has been sent to employers, who know they are subject to penalties under Irish labour law if they breach that law.</P>
        <P>Just 22 countries have ratified or acceded to the UN convention, which is quite broad, even though it has been open to signature and ratification since December 1990. I am informed that one of the main reasons EU member states have not ratified the convention is that it does not distinguish between legal and illegal, or documented <Col N="487" />and undocumented, migrants. In effect, the convention obliges countries to provide protection entitlements to workers about whom they have no information. The Deputy can readily appreciate the complications that would develop in that regard alone if the convention is ratified and the State is given obligations in respect of people who come to the State illegally. The ratification of the convention would have a wide-ranging impact on all Departments and on a range of policies. The Government is not minded to sign up to such obligations. There is no point in signing conventions without having full cognisance of their implications for our position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
        <P>Has the Minister discussed the implications of the ratification of the convention at EU level with representatives of other member states? If not, does he intend to do so? I suggest that all member states should try to streamline the implications of the signing of the convention. We should try to ensure that most, if not all, EU member states are in a position to ratify the convention at some point in the not too distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I would prefer to ask officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prepare a brief explanatory paper for the Deputy so that he can understand the implications of the convention. I am loath to put in place a new tranche of EU regulation and legislation in this area, especially in light of the issue raised by Deputy Hogan earlier. The EU needs to concentrate on the Lisbon Agenda, which relates to economic growth, because its economy is quite sluggish at present. If the EU is to compete with other parts of the world, it needs to engage in an in-depth review of how it approaches the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda, which relates to competitiveness, employment and economic growth. The EU has not successfully matched its rhetoric and its action, which should be its priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The research and development performance of Irish industry has shown a worthwhile improvement in recent years. Data made available by Forf&aacute;s indicates that business expenditure on research and development increased from &euro;917 million in 2001 to &euro;1,076 million in 2003. We have made considerable progress, but more needs to be done. The EU&rsquo;s research and innovation performance is significantly behind the US and Japan. Ireland&rsquo;s performance is still below the EU average. One of the two central conclusions of the Enterprise Strategy Group in 2004 was that an increased focus on research should be a core pillar of enterprise policy.</P>
        <P>The national action plan for promoting investment in research and development to 2010, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Knowledge Economy, was published last August. It sets out challenging targets for enterprise research and development performance, such as a doubling the number of companies with minimum scale research and development activity, or activity that is worth more than &euro;100,000 per annum. It envisages a fourfold increase in the number of firms that engage in research and development expenditure of more than &euro;2 million per annum. It recommends that overall business expenditure on research and development should be more than doubled, to &euro;2.5 billion. Enhanced research and development performance by firms needs to be supported by vibrant science and technology infrastructure, which can increase the pool of talented researchers available to industry and generate intellectual property that can be commercialised by firms.</P>
        <P>Work is under way on programmes, initiatives and strategies that will facilitate the fulfilment of the challenging agenda I have outlined. The new Cabinet sub-committee on science, technology and innovation, which I chair, has mandated the interdepartmental committee on science, technology and innovation to prepare a strategic <Col N="489" />implementation plan to develop Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>The development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, together with Science Foundation Ireland are working closely with my Department in the development of the plan and, indeed, the key performance metrics. The targets are reflected in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy, TransformingIrish Industry, which I launched recently.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Among the initiatives which I expect the plan to incorporate are a strengthening of the infrastructure for intellectual property, protection and commercialisation in third level institutions, greater promotion of research and development among non-research and development performing firms, initiatives to improve productivity and efficiency and simpler, more accessible financial support for both collaborative and in-house research and development.</P>
        <P>We have step-changed the level of State investment in research and development since 1998-99 through the PRTLI programme and the Science Foundation Ireland Programme, which has greatly expanded research capacity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
        <P>This is a question on which I would like to spend an hour. Unfortunately, the Minister has not answered the question which was whether he will initiate a time limit for a review of the research and development agendas of the various development agencies. For example, city and county enterprise boards have no research and development focus in their remit. Will he give them a research and development focus because such agencies dealing with micro industries are facing a sector that has huge problems, not just in terms of cost but of awareness, expertise and guidance in the area where there is a void? Will he agree that up to now there has been a significant void in the whole area of research and development? What is in ahead of the curve and what is in transforming industry will not of itself change this fact. Will the Minister initiate a time limited review of the research and development agendas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>There has been a review of Enterprise Ireland. I am preparing a roadmap or blueprint to achieve the Lisbon Agenda target of 2.5% in research and development. This will include the business spend as well as the State spend. We have signed up for the goals. We are in favour of increased research and development investment. We did a fantastic job in the past five or six years in research and development compared to the previous 20 years, which has brought us to a certain level. I am very committed to this subject.</P>
        <P>We now need, in a nuts-and-bolts fashion, to work out how we will achieve the Lisbon targets, how to double the number of researcher postgraduates in the next six or seven years, what it will mean for the expansion of universities or <Col N="490" />institutes of technology and what it will mean for business to increase significantly the business spend in research and development. We have all signed up to the objectives and goals. We now need to sign up for and work through the incremental steps necessary to achieve the challenging targets we set ourselves over the next five to six years. I hope to have this completed by July.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a debate in the House in the autumn on research and development, because it is important for the Parliament to speak on the importance of research and development to Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is in the final stages of its consultation with the social partners and interested parties on the formulation of new construction regulations. These regulations will be made by me under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004, which I expect will be passed by the House during this term. The legal advice to me is that the regulations must be made under the Bill, which I intend to do very soon after the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>What was the legal impediment to enacting these regulations under the old Act, as originally intended and notified to the House? Presumably the parliamentary adviser who made such notification had no difficulty with that legal process. Does the Minister of State share my deep concern at the dramatic increase in fatalities in the workplace, given that nine people were killed in the construction industry in the first four months of this year as opposed to 15 in all of last year, and in the workplace generally 27 died in the first four months of this year, which is a 40% increase on last year? Since the regulations have been pending for 18 months, will the Minister of State give a specific deadline, not further consultation, on when the regulations will be implemented and when will the additional labour force inspectors be in place to enforce them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>The new regulations will be put in place under section 17 of the new Bill. These <Col N="491" />include a number of important new groups in construction, particularly clients who commission building work, architects, engineers and designers. The Health and Safety Authority is engaged in exhaustive consultation with architects, engineers and designers who are concerned about their new legal responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the draft regulation is to prescribe the main requirements for the protection, safety, health and welfare of persons working on construction sites and to give further effect to the Council directive of 1992. The new directives will replace the existing ones. They will set out the minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister of State answer the questions I posed? What was the impediment to the original notification his predecessor made to the House that the regulations would be enacted 18 months ago under the previous Act? Why have 18 months been wasted in putting the regulations in place, with a back-drop of terrible carnage in the workplace? When will the additional inspectors be in place to enforce the regulations?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>This is what is happening. The Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor said 18 months ago that the regulations would be put in place under the old Act. Is there a legal impediment to doing that and, if so, what is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the new legislation, it is possible to include the additional groups to whom I referred in my first response.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>This might have been done. However, I assume it was intended that the new legislation would be in place long before now. When I was appointed last October, it was hoped the Bill would be passed before Christmas, but as Deputies will be aware, it took considerably longer.</P>
        <P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the increased number of deaths in the first five months of the year against a background of a 30% decrease in 2004. There is cause for concern as a result of the increased number of deaths earlier this year. No doubt the new regime, which will come into play under the new Act and the new regulations, will have a positive impact on what is happening. In early April, the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced additional labour inspectors. The Health and Safety Authority, which has responsibility in this area, has its own inspectorate who carried out a record number of inspections in 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>I share with Deputy Howlin and the Minister of State my concern about the number of deaths of people on building sites in the first quarter of this year. The Minister of State will be aware of the debate on the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill and the lack of control in regard to training people on building sites. I hope the increase in the number of fatalities has nothing to do with the laxity displayed by the State in training people in the workplace, particularly on building sites? Will he give us an indication of results from a Garda investigation which is ongoing in regard to retrieving money unlawfully paid to F&Aacute;S for the purposes of training in the construction sector under the safe pass scheme and other related schemes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>As I informed Deputy Hogan, a review of the training regime is under way, which undoubtedly will impact positively on the experience in the future. I cannot say whether the specific training in the cases involved had an impact. If that were the case, I presume it would have been brought to my attention. I have had no update since last month on the Garda inquiry.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s question on the number of inspections, yesterday I had the pleasure of launching the 2004 Health and Safety Authority report. It was accompanied by a considerable additional document which provides data and analyses on deaths by sector and by region. It provides interesting reading and will inform the work of the Health and Safety Authority and the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme in the coming months and years. The HSA has directed its inspections at particular areas. Approximately 100 inspectors are involved, some of who had an increased workload last year because of the EU Presidency. They will return to full-time duty with the HSA this year, which will result in additional inspections, particularly in areas highlighted as having the most difficulties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Software companies and others in the high technology sectors face significant chal<Col N="493" />lenges as a result of globalisation and increased global competition. Irish companies must increasingly compete through innovation, increased investment in research and development and a strong focus on export growth. These are the key issues both now and for the future. The software sector is a substantial contributor to export-based revenue generation in the economy. The sector has experienced sustained growth over the past ten years and accounts for exports of more than &euro;14 billion annually. An increasing number of entrepreneurs has started high value added, high export growth and high potential companies in the indigenous sector.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Enterprise Ireland has supported more than 470 high potential start-up companies, which employ 7,500 people and have a cumulative turnover of more than &euro;1 billion each year. These companies, which include a strong contingent of software companies, represent a new breed of globally competitive industry based on knowledge and innovation. For continued success, substantially increased levels of applied research in domestic firms will be needed and we must foster an environment where there exists a close working relationship between companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>The strategy for EI, which I launched on 4 May 2005, outlines a new approach to the development of the industry. To date, a relatively small number of companies has increased sales to in excess of &euro;20 million. Software will represent a key target sector for the development of such companies. Growth worldwide has slowed due to a combination of general global economic slowdown and saturation in some software markets. However, the indications are that the global software industry will have a value of US $126.5 billion in 2007 and, therefore, in spite of growth in the industry having slowed in recent years, this still represents a growth rate of 6.4% on 2002. Four of the top five software companies in the world have significant operations in Ireland including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Symantec.</P>
        <P>It is a reflection of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive operating environment that it continues to win mobile high quality investment projects from the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies. A number of high profile investments have been announced. These include companies investing in Ireland for the first time. There have also been some notable successes in the digital media and Internet technology areas. Recent announcements by Yahoo, Amazon.com and DC Studios have added to Ireland&rsquo;s excellent reputation as a strategic location for IT services to support business activities throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>Innovation and clearly differentiated products, services and customer solutions are key factors in winning business in international markets. Moreover, as an export market driven nation, Ireland needs to continually develop and improve skills in sales and marketing. In this regard, the successful sales star programme, which is a joint initiative of Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and the Irish Software <Col N="494" />Association and which is focused on the development of the sales capability within expanding software companies, is an example of what can be achieved both now and into the future. I am confident the initiatives we have taken and continue to take will further enhance the reputation of the software industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>Has the Minister a strategy to commercialise research and development, in light of the major investment by Science Foundation Ireland in universities and institutes of technology?

Has the Minister a strategy to harness that potential for employment in this jurisdiction?</P>

The key strategic objectives are increased investment in research and development; to facilitate the involvement of those companies in such investment; a strong focus on IT education both at third and second levels; stronger research and development measures in the protection of IT; and the translation and commercialisation of research into new companies within our universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTE revealed appalling care of the elderly in the Leas Cross nursing home, Swords, County Dublin. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; crew and Mr. Justice Clarke should be congratulated for looking after the public interest in this serious matter. &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; exposed a level of degrading and humiliating treatment of vulnerable and elderly people, which should not be tolerated in this or any other society. These people are at everybody&rsquo;s mercy at the end of their days. They built this economy when times were tough and those who featured on the programme last night have paid through the nose for the privilege of being, effectively, tortured.</P>
      <P>The majority of nursing homes are run to a high standard but, clearly, a number fall below minimum standards and it is Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure high standards are met. Apart from the treatment of the patients in the Leas Cross nursing home, the programme also raised serious questions about the regulation of nursing homes by the Health Service Executive. It is completely and utterly inexcusable that nursing homes should be notified in advance of the date and time of inspections. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has raised these matters for the past seven years and he has encountered a stone wall on every occasion. His file is a foot thick with documents provided following freedom of information requests but it has taken a national television programme to expose the concerns of many people about these matters.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give a guarantee to immediately establish an independent nursing home inspectorate for all nursing homes, voluntary, private and public? Will he give an undertaking that, forthwith, the Health Service Executive will publish all nursing home inspection reports, which should be available free of charge on the Internet? Will he also give an undertaking that nursing homes are adequately staffed and resourced with appropriate professionals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme last night uncovered shocking treatment of vulnerable people in the units investigated. No excuse should be offered to defend what happened, as there is no defence for it. It was distressing and upsetting. There was a lack of training, management, supervision and almost everything else in that elderly care unit. On behalf of the Government, I express deep concern with the situation described on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; regarding Leas Cross nursing home.</P>
      <P>As we have announced, the Government is determined that a new and stronger regulatory system will be put in place so vulnerable people,particularly the elderly, are protected. The relevant Bill to establish the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis to deal with both private and public nursing homes will be published later this year. In answer to questions asked outside the House, the inspectorate will be <Col N="496" />independent of the HSE. The Department of Health and Children is reviewing the operation of the 1990 and 1993 nursing home Acts to strengthen the powers available to the regulatory authorities. The HSE has been working for considerable time on a national approach to the inspection of nursing homes. This work will be assisted by the fact the HSE is a national agency unlike the old system of health boards.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me about the reports that will be prepared. The T&aacute;naiste has asked that these reports be made available to relatives or others for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach condemn outright the findings and perpetrators identified in &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;? I ask the Taoiseach to put an end to announced inspections. The law provides for two inspections of every nursing home each year. There are 423 private nursing homes but only 82 were inspected in 2004, presumably on announcement. Saying this is not known about is not good enough. The Minister of State with responsibility at the time, Deputy Callely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;wrote about a patient who was sent from a nursing home to Beaumont Hospital. The registrar in question said the following about the patient: &ldquo;Bad pressure sores, with blistering on the heels and broken skin ulcer, with large excoriated areas on the buttocks, which in my opinion at that time were the worst pressure sores I had seen&rdquo;. A report was sought on this case by the then Minister of State responsible for the elderly.</P>
      <P>We know from demographic studies what will happen in terms of numbers. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the nursing homes to which accident and emergency units refer patients under the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s new programme have been inspected unannounced and are up to standard? In everyone&rsquo;s interests, will the Taoiseach confirm the ending of the practice of announced inspections of nursing homes? If we saw what was on that programme happening in another country, persons in this House would jump up and down with outrage. I watched the programme again before 8 a.m. and it reminded me of something from the Second World War. The conditions and behaviour were absolutely appalling. The Taoiseach has a chance to do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has again asked me to condemn unequivocally what we saw on the programme last night. No excuse can or should be offered for standing over facilities such as that. When one is independently inspecting <Col N="497" />something, it is bizarre to give warning by ringing ahead. If someone is knowingly or unintentionally acting in such a way in any home, not just Leas Cross, giving notice means what one is doing is not an inspection in a real sense. There should be independent inspections. The inspectorate will be independent of the HSE. Otherwise, the HSE would be referring patients and also examining facilities. The inspectorate must, therefore, be independent.</P>
      <P>Specifically in connection with the Leas Cross nursing home, while 21 of the 96 patients were private patients, the home was not one of the newer homes to which people are referred. The HSE has been working for some time on a common national approach to the inspection of nursing homes, which is important. In this way, we have the same benchmark inspection everywhere and standards are crosschecked against acceptable standards.</P>

      <P>The patients moving from acute beds are not going to that location. Many people do not wish to be moved. If they did want to, they would be. Following meetings held today, the HSE has agreed that a nurse manager supported by other nursing staff will go to Leas Cross immediately and that a governors board will be established, composed of a geriatrician, a GP and relatives. An inquiry team will examine other relevant issues raised by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny, I was shocked. It is shameful for the Government and shameful for our society that what was depicted so graphically last night could happen in modern day society. Private nursing homes are now a part of the health services infrastructure and the new Minister for Health and Children has said they will play a greater role in the future. They are unregulated and operate under the very poor legislation introduced in 1990. Even the minimal standards established therein have been unenforced and general invigilation of standards does not apply.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify whether this institution is one of those involved in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s <Col N="498" />tendering to the private sector for approximately 500 places for step-down care? The Taoiseach opened the home himself, did he not? Are these homes included in the tenders? My colleague, Deputy Burton, submitted an amendment to the Finance Bill to make tax relief arrangements compatible with standards of care and health criteria but it was rejected by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. Will the Taoiseach rethink his Government&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with the whistleblowers Bill given the relevance of it in this situation and the campaign by the INO to deal with cover ups by giving protection to staff and others? Is the Taoiseach committing to an independent inspectorate? As we know, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 is insufficient.</P>

      <P>I am just framing my question. Twice in the last three weeks, the Government brought emergency legislation before the House and we enacted all Stages in a matter of hours to save the State money. Surely we can enact legislation before this House rises for the summer recess to deal with this situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked a number of questions. I will confirm what I told Deputy Kenny earlier, that no beds from the present lot of beds purchased from the private sector were in Leas Cross nursing home. As previously planned, the social services inspectorate will be established on a statutory basis and be independent of the HSE. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 will be reviewed urgently. Whether it requires amendment will be a matter for the review. The nursing home regulations are also being reviewed.</P>
      <P>I opened the Leas Cross nursing home in spring 1998. At that time, it was stated that the home would provide residential care for up to 40 residents with single and double room accommodation that would accord with the policies of the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health and Children. Obviously, that is now a matter to be examined by the Health Service Executive. Following meetings today with the owner and staff at the home, the HSE has appointed a nurse manager with immediate effect who will be supported by nursing staff. A governance board will be set up and will include a geriatrician, a general practitioner and relatives of the residents. The other matters raised by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme will also be examined by the HSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the position regarding public patients sent to the Leas Cross nursing home and, consequently, subsidised <Col N="499" />by the State? I understand that patients have been transferred from St. Ita&rsquo;s to this facility. What category of patients was involved in that transfer? Is the State subsidising those patients and were they included in the tender?</P>
      <P>Various Ministers are on the record of the House for more than five years making the same commitment as that just made by the Taoiseach regarding an independent inspectorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power has put short-term measures in place today, namely, the nursing home will operate under new management and professional staff will be put in place. Are any other steps being taken? What, for example, is the purpose of calling in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and what kind of inquiry is it undertaking?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that not only were patients stripped of their normal human dignity but their lives were put at risk? The fact that a patient in the home had MRSA and neither staff nor patients were protected from the spread of that infection is unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s questions, there are 96 patients in the unit, 21 of whom are private. Therefore, most of the people in the home are public patients who are being fully or partially funded by the State. These figures are not the most up to date, but a large proportion &mdash; almost 80% &mdash; of the residents are public patients.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct in his assertion regarding the commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the answer to Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan&rsquo;s question.</P>
      <P>The decision on the independent inspectorate was part of the health reform programme. As already announced, the social services inspectorate will be set up on a statutory basis. It has also been announced that it will form part of the health information and standards Bill, which is in preparation. I cannot tell the Deputy at what stage that Bill is, but it is due to be passed this year. It is part of the reform programme. The inspectorate is independent, so all information will be in the public domain.</P>
      <P>Residents have been offered the opportunity to move from the home and, strange as it may seem, most of them do not want to according to the HSE. Perhaps they are residents in other units, but they do not want to move and that is why the HSE has put a nurse manager in place immediately.</P>

      <P>As already stated, a governance board will be set up and will include a geriatrician, a general practitioner and relatives of residents. While most people have opted to stay in the home, if some of the public patients wish to move they will be accommodated elsewhere. An inquiry team will examine the other issues raise by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme as well as any other relevant issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>More often than not, on Tuesday afternoon Leaders&rsquo; Questions is informed by the RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. Once again, the situation revealed by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation has proved to be shocking. Indeed, the shock in north County Dublin is quite palpable given the trust placed in the Leas Cross nursing home by relatives and patients.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the Health Service Executive will conduct an investigation. However, is it not the case that much of the questioning in the House today has focused on the need for an independent inspectorate and investigation? I suggest that the Taoiseach should start as he means to continue, with an independent investigation, in this case, entirely independent of the HSE.</P>
      <P>In terms of the standard of nursing home care, will we have a comparable rating with other countries? For example, four hours personal attention per day is considered the norm in the United States whereas here the norm is 2.5 hours. Can the Taoiseach clarify whether the standards will be raised once the investigation is completed? Will regulations governing the sector be tightened up? Certainly, terms such as &ldquo;adequate staffing&rdquo; are used as a get-out clause for some people and do not represent proper regulation.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Leas Cross nursing home had an ISO accreditation? Given that he was asked to perform the opening ceremony, is it not incumbent on him to satisfy themselves that standards have been complied with so that his is not implicated in any way in the course of an investigation, such as the one about to be carried out? Is there not a lesson here for the Taoiseach and other Ministers to ensure that they <Col N="501" />are not found wanting when it comes to insisting on high standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards of care are set by geriatricians who design them to achieve the best level of care. That is what takes place in all private nursing homes. While the Health Service Executive does not run this particular home because it is not a public facility, its involvement in examining the issues raised by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; is appropriate. In future, the inspector will be independent of the HSE. However, the HSE put in place in the home today appropriate staff and services to deal with the problems highlighted.</P>
      <P>I opened the Leas Cross home in 1998 and it was a new building then. It has obviously had a few extensions since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of the opening, the home had 30 beds; now it has 90 beds.</P>
      <P>The issues were about the management, care provided and maintenance of the home. When the home was opened, it was confirmed that its policies were up to Eastern Health Board and Department of Health and Children standards. Unfortunately, I have not been out there inspecting the standards every day since then, so the Deputy&rsquo;s question does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The buck never stops with the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that there is a professional body in place that can inspect facilities on an unannounced basis. That is the only way that we can keep standards to the highest level, keep people on their toes and ensure that standards which are set on the opening of a facility are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing that the Taoiseach does not feel he has any lessons to learn from having opened this facility. It appears that in early May, the Government shelved plans by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to develop 850 beds in community nursing units in the east and south as part of a PPP arrangement on the grounds that the plans would have breached the Government&rsquo;s HSE employment ceiling. I wonder whether the former Minister&rsquo;s announcement regarding the 850 beds, a commitment that he later abandoned, was made with the knowledge of the concerns of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that this type of tax relief is making a considerable amount of money for some people and that the State is effectively abdicating responsibility for ensuring standards are maintained and people are treated with dignity? Is it not the case that one of the reasons for such lax enforcement of standards is that there is no <Col N="502" />spare capacity if an inspector goes into a nursing home and decides that it must be closed? In many cases, there is nowhere for patients from substandard nursing homes to go. The Taoiseach mentioned that patients at the nursing home featured in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme did not want to leave it but surely this is not the point. The point should be that if a nursing home must be closed down there should not be the option for people to stay put. One of the reasons places like this are not closed down is that the State has not provided for the spare capacity to allow such a decision to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many nursing homes that adhere to the highest standards, as has been stated earlier on. For some years, the social services inspectorate has stated that it should be put on a statutory basis. Health board checks on nursing homes have been carried out since the 1990 Act. There has been a legislative basis for these checks for the past 15 years. Deputy Kenny stated that two inspections are carried out every year. There are more inspections where health board officials have particular concerns about a home or where it is housed in an older building. It is better to examine matters like this in the round. It has been long announced that the social services inspectorate will be established as an independent agency on a statutory basis. We will examine the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the regulations to see if they improve the situation and will seek to end the regrettable practice of informing nursing homes that they will be inspected.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and Children gave a commitment that the health information and quality authority Bill would be introduced at the same time as the legislation establishing the Health Service Executive. That did not happen, despite the undertaking from the <Col N="506" />Government. The Health Act 2004 was passed last December but we still have not seen the other Bill. In view of the terrible findings regarding private nursing homes, will the Taoiseach not uncouple the inspectorate legislation from the information and quality authority Bill and introduce the inspectorate Bill as a priority during this session? The other legislation can take its course. Surely the Taoiseach will accept that this is urgent. To tie the two measures will lead to more delay rather than give this sector the urgent attention which it requires.</P>

      <P FLI="0">A map has been circulated which is relevant to the amendments being discussed and might be of help to Deputies.</P>
      <P>The development of the Grangegorman site is of great importance to all Dublin. I accept the reservations expressed on Committee Stage <Col N="511" />regarding the proportionate interest of those living in proximity to the site as compared with those living in other parts of the city. Amendments Nos. 2, 7 and 90 to the definition of the Grangegorman neighbourhood are designed to reflect these views.</P>
      <P>The neighbourhood now consists of eight electoral wards: Arran Quay, wards A to E, inclusive, Inns Quay, wards B and C, and Cabra east, ward C. The location of the Dublin Institute of Technology in this area will greatly enhance not only education and training, which underpin economic activity within the surrounding area, but will also enhance access opportunities, extend cultural facilities, provide for recreational and sporting facilities and the rebuilding and developing of large areas of dereliction, and create direct and indirect employment opportunities. Therefore, in drawing up the amendment, I have sought to reach a balance that will provide access to residents in those areas most likely to be affected and to benefit from the project.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are restrictive and would result in large areas in this part of the city being excluded from having a say in a project that would be of direct benefit to them socially, recreationally, economically and in terms of educational inclusion. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally accept the Minister&rsquo;s proposal. When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage, I sought to come up with a formula that would achieve what the Minister has outlined, namely, that the areas around the Grangegorman site would get some sort of preference as distinct from what was originally proposed, which was that the two entire local electoral areas, which extend much beyond that area, would be included. The Minister has come up with a fair compromise.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 is simply to give recognition to the fact that the areas surrounding the Grangegorman redevelopment site contain a range of residents and community organisations which have a long-standing interest in the site and have been awaiting the redevelopment of this area for some time. Given their interest, concern and obvious involvement with the site due to living adjacent to it, I felt that the members of such organisations, in particular, should be represented or that the areas they represented should make up the Grangegorman neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s proposal. I am grateful to her for making the map available because it makes the situation clearer and shows where the wards are. It is a reasonable compromise between the two options and achieves what I sought to achieve in my amendment. Therefore, I am happy to withdraw my amendment. I accept the Minister has moved on this since Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>As I come from the mid-west, I am not as familiar with the area as my colleagues, Deputies Gregory and Costello. I thank the Minister for taking on board the comments we made on Committee Stage when we had a long debate on the issue of ensuring that the local residents in the immediate area would have proper consultation rights and proper involvement in regard to the Bill. I acknowledge the help of the local residents groups which met Members on this issue.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s sentiments. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s proposals. My colleague, Deputy Costello, who is more familiar with the area than I, will make any further points in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The various wards are outlined on map provided by the Minister. The problem we had on Committee Stage has been addressed by the Minister. We needed to ensure we did not cast the net too widely or too narrowly and that all the relevant associations which have been in contact with Members and which are contiguous to or adjoining the proposed development would be represented in the neighbourhood area.</P>
      <P>I expected the boundary would run along the Phibsboro Road and that the area would not go beyond that road and Church Street. The line has now been extended to include Eccles Street and Dorset Street, so other residents' associations such as the Blessington Street residents' association and various tenants' associations from Dominick Street and Church Street will be involved. While I have no problem with that, the area involved is wider than I had expected and goes outside the area of interest indicated by the local community. I expected the boundary to run along the Phibsboro Road. It does not pose a problem for anybody but will require a greater range of consultation and we expected this to be in the first instance. However, it clarifies the situation and we know where we are going from here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the main concerns expressed by residents and many of the amendments attempt to address the issue of consultation with the local community. Most people will be happy with the route the Minister has taken. Local residents worry that they only have one opportunity with regard to the matter. The neighbourhood includes groups which are very concerned about the development of this project. As was said on Committee Stage, the site is not the only important issue. It will also impact on the local neighbourhood and community and it is important that they feel part of the development. We talk of people taking ownership of a site, but it is a big plus to have the local residents and community involved. The Minister&rsquo;s amendment is a good indication of the direction the Bill will take and I look forward to the next amendment.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment makes it clear that from its formation the focus of the agency shall be one that keeps the needs of the local community and other stakeholders as a central function of its activities. The Bill sets up a consultative group and it should be recognised in this section of the legislation as an important part of the efficient and equitable function of the agency.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 gives the consultative group a role in the planning process. Local community input will have its highest leverage in agreements on planning applications.

      <P>My related amendments refer to consultation with the local community. This should be proper consultation and should involve talking with people and taking their views on board rather than talking at them and telling them what is happening. I have tried to strengthen the nature of community consultation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; with &ldquo;community consultation&rdquo;. Amendment No. 83 refers to community consultation strategy concerning the development of the Grangegorman site. The community consultation strategy should have regard to standard community consultation best practice, especially with reference to successful consultations that have previously taken place locally. This is to ensure this consultation is in accordance with best practice and genuinely involves dialogue between local organisations and the agency.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 proposes to insert reference to local organisations concerned with economic, social or other development, including employment, education or training, and local community development organisations. I want to ensure the organisations are consulted and that the process is all-embracing. It should include areas such as employment, education and training to ensure consultation with the various voices at local level.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 23 refers to page 9, line 10. The Bill, as it stands, allows con<Col N="515" />sultation with residents in the Grangegorman neighbourhood, patients, providers, students and so on. However, community development organisations are also very active in the area, such as Inner City Partnership as well as a range of other organisations. Many of these work in the area but would not necessarily be resident. Residents should get top priority in any consultation, but they would welcome the participation of community development organisations, such as the local partnership, in such consultation. The amendment would not in any way take from the section. It would enhance it. I ask the Minister to consider my point. Perhaps she would accept the reasonable inclusion of community development organisations for the reason I have outlined.</P>

I understand some of the reasons the Minister will not include community organisations but if this Bill is to enhance integration between the Grangegorman campus and the community at large, community development groups must be considered. The exact nature of that can be worked out later but it would send out a positive message if this wording were inserted in the Bill. It is not in any way contentious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support all the amendments, including the Minister&rsquo;s amendment which is very important. Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment No. 21 seeks to delete the word &ldquo;allow&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;provide for&rdquo;. It is much more important to provide for than allow consultation and the positive restatement of that in this important section underlines that. Her amendment No. 20 <Col N="516" />seeks to delete the word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;community consultation&rdquo;. I do not see the need for a communications strategy. It should be a consultation strategy. Both those amendments would greatly strengthen the legislation in a proactive way. The range of representation would be extended to include not just the people who are resident in the area but also those working in the area.</P>
      <P>A large network of people is active in the area, some of whom work nine to five and others who work longer hours. They have been resident in the area all their lives. The people who have been doing that work for many years, whether it is the inner city partnership, the Market Area Community Resource Organisation, MACRO, which also includes people working in various organisations, or the north-west network group all have much to offer. They are involved in creating employment and providing services in the area and work in an integral way with the residents in the area. It would be worthwhile if the Minister accepted Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment No. 22 on local organisations concerned with economic, social or other development, including employment, education or training and local community development organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when discussing such amendments that we remind ourselves of the principal purpose of the Bill, which is to provide a campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology and health care facilities for the Eastern Regional Health Authority on the Grangegorman site. The facilities are very extensive but they will be available to the local community and section 11, on which I have proposed an amendment, will grant access and use of the site and its facilities to the local residents. I am satisfied that the provisions provided in that section are adequate and I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 9 or 15.</P>
      <P>On the consultation process, a number of Deputies suggested on Committee Stage that the provision for consultation with stakeholders should be strengthened. I agreed to examine the wording of paragraph (<i>k</i>) which refers to the preparation of a communications strategy. A communications strategy is wider than a consultation strategy. Consultation is part of it but there are many people with whom communications will be needed as opposed to consultation. The word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; is more inclusive than &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; on its own. Equally, having consulted with the Parliamentary Counsel, the new wording &ldquo;provided for&rdquo; in my amendment No. 21 will strengthen the provision for consultation with the stakeholders.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a wide range of provisions for bilateral communication between the agency and the stakeholders in the project as well as providing for consultation with the local community. One of the key features is that we are talking about residents. As well as a communications strategy, the consultancy group will include local residents. Regarding the amendments on the <Col N="517" />community development groups, I would have thought there is no greater development than for the communities to voice their opinions, which is what is happening, by having the residents directly involved rather than somebody speaking on their behalf. The local residents are being appointed to the agency because they are more than capable of expressing their wishes without any group doing it on their behalf. Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 22, 23 or 26.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 would limit the consultation process because it extends beyond the local community. I do not propose to accept that amendment. The proposed wording of amendment No. 83 is quite vague and does not add to the Bill in any way. I do not intend to accept that amendment either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that &ldquo;communications&rdquo; is a wider wording but it is weaker. &ldquo;Communications&rdquo; is telling people something whereas &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; implies a much more interactive relationship. I suggest the Minister might consider including &ldquo;communications&rdquo; and &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in the Bill. I realise we cannot do that today but perhaps it can be done when the Bill goes to the Seanad. There should not be a provision just for communications. These people need genuine consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the Minister&rsquo;s response. I would be the first to agree that the residents are well able to voice their own concerns and do not need any assistance in that regard. They would recognise, however, the value of groups such as the inner city partnership and as this is a communication or consultation process, to exclude groups such as the inner city partnership from consultation on a development that clearly has implications for their work takes from the Bill and the process the Minister is trying to achieve. I regret that the Minister will not accept what I believe was a reasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put one other reason to the Minister. In many cases, opposition to good legislation, which this Bill is, can arise from a misunderstanding or a feeling of alienation. If the people who work in the Dublin Inner City Partnership and other bodies do not believe they are full stakeholders in the project through the wording of this Bill, there is a danger that opposition will arise purely out of a sense of alienation. That is something to keep in mind. As we know from various peace processes throughout the world, wording can be inclusive and have a positive effect, particularly non-contentious wording such as is the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s suggestion that the Minister might expand the strategy from a communications strategy to include communications and consultation would address what is contained in her amendment but it would also <Col N="518" />allow for a broader strategy to be put together that would cover the essential needs of the area.</P>
      <P>On the issue of organisations, the Minister said the residents are able to speak for themselves. There is no doubt that they are represented in the legislation. Not only does the area have resident associations active in the area, the residents are involved in organisations comprising a mixture of people from inside and outside the area. The markets area residents organisation has a chairman who lives outside the constituency. The Dublin Inner City Partnership has a CEO who lives outside the constituency but the activities are within the neighbourhood. The northwest inner-city network has a list of a large number of organisations that are active in the fields of education, employment and service to deal with the elderly and various services. These organisations are interlinked with residents and with residents&rsquo; associations so there is no contradiction in what the Minister has said. We would like to see the residents deeply involved and I am sure they will fight their own corner. That does not mean that one excludes other organisations active in the area, who may have been active for decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;communications strategy&rdquo; is broad enough to include everything and should remain, particularly as the wording has been strengthened so that it says it will provide for consultations. It is a central part of what the strategy shall include. That is also set out in section 11 under the heading &ldquo;Strategic Plan&rdquo;. There is no question of alienating anyone in this section. It is a win-win situation. This is an area to which local residents have had no access in the past and they will now have access. There is development of facilities that did not exist in the past and to which local residents will have access. There is provision of education facilities in an area that did not have such extensive facilities in the past. The local community will gain much by living next to the Grangegorman site, which was behind closed walls for a long time, with the facilities unavailable to the local communities.</P>
      <P>One of the key features of the partnerships throughout the country is that they all aim for training in self-empowerment. This is true of the southside partnership, the inner-city partnerships or the community development groups. They aim for self-empowerment for local communities and for individuals in communities. We offer self-empowerment for the local residents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 8, line 10, after &ldquo;facilities,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <Col N="519" />
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;including sporting and leisure facilities to which the adjoining local communities will have access. Special provision will be made for educationally disadvantaged children from local communities to enable them to progress to third level education,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This deals with the functions of the agency. As the Bill stands it reads: &ldquo;The functions of the Agency shall be to promote the development of the Grangegorman site as a location for education, health and other facilities&rdquo;. The Minister has already pointed out that there will be facilities in the redevelopment available to the local community. I ask that this measure be included as a function of the agency.</P>
      <P>I have clear reasons for the objectives in my amendment. There are large, open-air leisure facilities available on the open land on the Grangegorman site and the Minister is not correct in saying that these were never available to local residents. In the past they were available, to some degree. The commitment to access for local residents is there, so I fail to understand why this cannot be spelt out in the functions of the agency so that the agency is clear that one of its functions is to allow local residents and community groups access to the facilities.</P>
      <P>This is a major educational development in the heart of the inner city, in an area where many children never get to third level education. Many of them struggle to complete second level education. A recent report by the HEA pointed out that the north inner city is one of the most disadvantaged areas in the State, based on the numbers that enter third level education. There should be some recognition of this extraordinary irony, that the headquarters of a third level institution will be in an area where so many of the children do not reach third level institutions. It is necessary to provide for educationally disadvantaged children from local communities to enable them to progress to third level education.</P>
      <P>If that were included in the functions of the agency some worthwhile way would be found to achieve that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 10, and agree with everything Deputy Gregory has said on it. Where there have been largescale rezonings opposed by the local community, including in my constituency, there has been a tendency to provide facilities for the community rather than facilities to which the community has access. In the context of the local community and neighbouring residents being stakeholders in this ambitious project it would make sense to include the wording &ldquo;including facilities for the local community,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about facilities managed by DIT or any health body but a facility that is within the campus, to be handed over to the community. Use of this facility could be allowed by other stakeholders in the campus. When undertaking a project of this size and nature it is <Col N="520" />important that facilities be provided for the community, rather than allowing the community access. This can be interpreted as patronising even if this is not the intention. Facilities should be provided for the community to enhance the area rather than as a sop to the neighbouring communities. This amendment would allow this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 is similar to amendment No. 10. This is a unique opportunity. We have a totally new campus in the heart of an area where there has not been a tradition of opportunity to enter third level education. We should take this opportunity to ensure that these measures are built into the legislation from the outset, and that they are included in the functions of the agency that will establish the activities taking place on the site. We have some old universities that were built in a time when there was not the same level of participation in third level education that we have now. In that sense this matter is unique. For that reason it would be beneficial from everybody&rsquo;s point of view if there was interactive consideration of the needs and opportunities of the local community in having such a facility on its doorstep. That is the reason for my amendment, as it is for the others in this group. I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s amendment, amendment No. 10, which is both positive and progressive. It would add to the legislation by strengthening its depth and quality. This is an important section of the Bill that deals specifically with the issue of educational disadvantage. It also concerns the Minister&rsquo;s educational policy.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 is strongly connected to the Minister&rsquo;s announcement yesterday of an allocation of &euro;40 million to tackle educational disadvantage. I commend her for that extra assistance for children in areas of educational disadvantage which is a positive and progressive step. However, it is all very well to have third level institutions on sites in various communities but we must open up such services for the use of children and local community groups.</P>
      <P>Space is a major issue in this part of Dublin. It will be a positive development if the local community, including youth groups and others, will have the opportunity to use these facilities. Such space is urgently required.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that the extra &euro;40 million to tackle educational disadvantage is part of a strategy to deal with disadvantaged areas generally. Other strategies are also required to provide proper housing and employment. Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s amendment would add teeth to these concepts.</P>
      <P>We must support the investment being made int areas of educational disadvantage. In this respect, I welcome the additional &euro;40 million in expenditure, which is important. In particular, I welcome the improved system for identifying the levels of disadvantage in schools. Smaller classes <Col N="521" />are essential, comprising a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes. I am glad the Minister has targeted resources at those in most need.</P>
      <P>The provision of early childhood education is a key strategy because most children in disadvantaged areas start such education at four years of age, two or three years behind the average middle income family. Social deprivation is the reason for this educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s amendment seeks special provision for educationally disadvantaged children to enable them to progress to third level education. This will be the key to any long-term strategy. I wish to see a ten year programme to identify children moving from primary to second level and who, I hope, will get a crack at third level education. It is sad that many such children drop out of the education system too early. As a result, the State is losing this resource. Many children from disadvantaged areas leave the school system for economic and social reasons. When one meets them ten years later, they are not necessarily all unemployed. Some may be and get into difficulties but the majority end up running their own businesses, some with top quality jobs, due to sheer effort and determination in using their creativity. I often wonder if they had had the opportunity of finishing the leaving certificate and entering third level, what type of people they would be.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s strong amendment would add to the Bill, I urge all Deputies to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I support all three amendments but particularly amendments Nos. 10 and 12 which are more detailed.</P>
      <P>In response to previous amendments the Minister said the main purpose of the Bill was to provide educational and health facilities. The legislation presents us with a unique opportunity. We spend much time talking about access to third level education and many improvements have been made in this regard. Third level institutions have become more willing to become involved with disadvantaged communities but the Bill could be used as a flagship project for other third level institutions to follow.</P>
      <P>The insertion of amendments such as these would place the legislation on a stronger footing from which to start. People in disadvantaged communities should be encouraged to progress to third level education. We must ensure they do not remain on the outside looking in. They should feel the new institution will be available to them and that its courses will be attainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments are all worthwhile. It is important to amend this section in order that we can spell out clearly the Grangegorman Development Agency&rsquo;s functions which already include education, health and the provision of other facilities. Deputies have sought to insert a reference to additional facilities and if that is not done now, it will be left to others to <Col N="522" />interpret later. In that case, some elements may or may not be inserted.</P>
      <P>The DIT has a good ethos which includes assisting disadvantaged students by providing, in particular, computers and computer networks for various flat complexes in the north inner city. As it has a good track record, I do not think it would be opposed to an amendment spelling out the fact that we expect the new campus to be community-based.</P>
      <P>Apart from being concerned with education and health, there is also a community dimension which should be prescribed at this level as part of the agency&rsquo;s functions. Such a provision should be inserted in the Bill to ensure it will not be neglected as it could be in later consultations and communications.</P>
      <P>Public representatives are well placed to know which areas are disadvantaged, as well as the causes and extent of such disadvantage. We are also aware of the opportunities that arise when a major educational and health facility is provided in the heart of the inner city &mdash; one of the largest areas of disadvantage in Dublin which includes Devaney Gardens, Drumalee, Constitution Hill, Kevin Barry House. Local schools include St. Gabriel&rsquo;s, Stanhope Street, Brunswick Street and George&rsquo;s Hill, all of which are located in confined areas and have educational difficulties, including special needs. The new facility could form part and parcel of their enhancement, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment puts it. We should use this opportunity to ensure the facility will be part of the overall development of the area. This opportunity must not be missed.</P>
      <P>This area has not benefited from tax incentives &mdash; although, perhaps, it may be all the better for this &mdash; which have applied to other inner city areas such as Smithfield. The new facility will amount to a tax incentive as it will incorporate a development worth almost &euro;1 billion. It could lift the whole area but will not do so unless we specify and prescribe the functions of the Grangegorman Development Agency. It would be a shame to miss this opportunity.</P>
      <P>The development of the new facility is in line with the Minister&rsquo;s own thinking on the issue of educational disadvantage, including the addition of elements to enhance the development of the area, as well as improved opportunities for young people to receive a better education and thus progress to second and third level studies. That would boost the area, ease its problems and reduce its crime levels. This is probably the last opportunity to ensure a major facelift, in every sense of the word, in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. For those who know anything about Dublin, the areas on the supplied map jump out as historically disadvantaged where people have been denied access not only to third level education but also to various facilities. I agree with Deputy Gregory that provisions for local access should be spelled out in the Bill. I spoke earlier of the negative <Col N="523" />impact it will have on local communities. All of us probably accept that, historically, many of them have been disadvantaged. Deputy Gregory is calling for the inclusion of sports and leisure facilities as it is important that local communities have access to such facilities.</P>
      <P>In discussing the previous amendment the Minister spoke of the need to provide for consultation. &ldquo;Consultation&rdquo; is the buzz word in Dublin. Local authorities are famous for consultation with local communities but in many cases someone will arrive from the local authority, explain a plan to local residents and call this &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;. I am not imagining this. I do not believe this is what the Minister means by consultation but a provision for consultation must be clear in the Bill, not only to the agency and the consultation group but also to local residents and those who pick up copies of the Bill. It must be clear that there are positive elements, that local people will have a say as well as seats on the appropriate board, and that the facilities will be provided.</P>
      <P>Many universities in the State have been ivory towers. The DIT which has a long and positive record stretching back more than 100 years has a positive role. It has been an open and inclusive institute and should be mentioned in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the amendments which are timely. We are back to what we discussed initially, the communities listed and the need for their involvement. It is not good enough to have the facilities located there if local kids can only look in, with the facilities not open to the public, as has happened in the past. It must be noted in the Bill that a new educational facility is being established, with a new way of looking at education. I hope the Minister will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. As the reference in the legislation to &ldquo;other facilities&rdquo; is not clear, the amendment would help to strengthen the legislation. It is greatly needed and would give support to local people and educationally disadvantaged children from local communities in order that they could use the facilities. I support the proposed change.</P>

      <P>I agree with what all the Deputies said about educational disadvantage. However, inserting it in legislation would not make anything happen.</P>

      <P>One tackles educational disadvantage by such initiatives as we launched yesterday, to which Deputy McGrath kindly referred. One of the north Dublin city schools, Larkin College, a tremendous college, provides for the local community the sort of service which aims to tackle educational disadvantage. We can tackle it by <Col N="524" />means of more investment and teachers, by targeting the children most in need by supporting their families and teachers. In this way the disadvantaged get inside the doors of the college to pursue their educational experience and are not merely provided with access to the facility.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about a Bill for the Dublin Institute of Technology. This is a Bill for a site, the Grangegorman site. Therefore, any wording inserted which referred to access to a building would mean nothing if one could not achieve access by coming through first or second level education. Merely saying in legislation this should happen will never make it happen. What will make it happen is the activity in which, as Deputy Costello noted, the DIT is involved in working with the community.</P>
      <P>Of all the colleges in Ireland, the institutes are the ones offering a particularly wide range of courses, ranging from certificate level in practical skills right through to degree and post-degree level. They offer the whole range of educational opportunities which allows people to gain access at various stages of their educational careers. However, inserting this in legislation which ultimately relates to the development of a site would make no difference.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gogarty spoke about setting aside space for the local community. As I said on Committee Stage, this is not legislation for a local sports field, local facilities or the local community. It is legislation for the development of a site, primarily for a third level institution, the Dublin Institute of Technology, and health facilities offering access to local people. Section 11 allows specifically for the inclusion of the entire local community. Therefore, there is no reason to be more specific by means of amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept them.</P>
      <P>Looking at the other regional colleges, in particular the college in Tallaght, well situated in a disadvantaged area, it is important to note that the uptake of places from the local and wider area, as Deputy Crowe will attest, is very positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>

      <P>Access to the college from those areas has increased enormously by virtue of its location and good education access office. The best way for students to get into it, as full participants, as opposed to merely accessing the facility, is by promoting an end to educational disadvantage and, through the education access office, third level grants, top-up grants and all those provisions which need to be further improved. The proposed amendments would not add anything to the functions of the agency or the schedule as set out.</P>

      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;in full consultation with local residents and community interests&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to clarify the functions of the agency, one of which is to &ldquo;prepare a strategic plan in accordance with section 11&rdquo;. I suggest that such a plan should be prepared &ldquo;in full consultation with local residents and community interests&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 seeks to amend the list of bodies with which the agency will have to consult when drawing up a strategic plan. If the amendment is accepted, section 11(1) will state that &ldquo;the Agency shall, as soon as may be after its establishment, prepare a plan ... for the strategic development of the Grangegorman site in consultation with local residents and community interests&rdquo;. The current list of bodies to be con<Col N="528" />sulted markedly omits residents&rsquo; organisations. Other groups such as the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Northern Area Health Board, the Eastern Regional Health Authority are mentioned, as are the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 proposes that the agency be required to consult &ldquo;local residents and community interests&rdquo;. I hope I do not have to convince the Minister of the obvious merits of such a proposal. As I said, the residents of the Grangegorman area have a keen interest in the development of the site in question. It is clear that the preparation of a strategic plan should involve consultation with local residents and community interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled amendments Nos. 29, 40 and 41. Amendment No. 29 is similar to Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s No. 28 in that it seeks to ensure local residents would be consulted about the strategic plan. Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 also relate to the strategic plan. Amendment No. 40 seeks to amend section 11(3) in order that when the agency is preparing a draft of the strategic plan, it would have to &ldquo;consult with the strategic plans of local organisations that are concerned with the economic, social or other development (including employment, education and training) and the strategic plans of local community development organisations&rdquo;. Amendment No. 41 would compel the agency to consult &ldquo;local residents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that the strategic plans of local organisations are taken into account when the agency&rsquo;s strategic plan is being developed. If local plans which involve the locality in question are in place, they should be taken into account when the agency&rsquo;s strategic plan for the site is being drawn up. The amendments are self-explanatory. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the need to consult agencies such as the inner city partnership when strategic plans are being developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of amendments has been tabled on the basis of the same principle that applied to the previous group which related to the agency. Section 11(3) states the agency &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do a certain number of things when the strategic plan is being prepared. However, the Bill does not oblige the agency to consult local residents, community groups and organisations. It specifies that it should consult certain bodies and institutions such as the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, Dublin City Council, Enterprise Ireland, the Dublin Transportation Office, C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann and the Railway Procurement Agency when the strategic plan is being drafted under section 11(3). While such bodies are worthy, it seems the most important ones to consult are those representing local residents whose opinions should be catered for when strategic plans are being drawn up. Any <Col N="529" />draft plan should be developed on foot of consultation with local residents and organisations. It is difficult to understand how there can be a proper strategic plan that does not involve the local community in the consultative process. It is difficult to understand how there can be a proper strategic plan that does not involve the local community in the consultative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 43 will clarify where I stand on the other amendments. The amendment is designed to give due recognition in the strategic plan to local communities and residents in both the immediate areas of the Grangegorman site or neighbourhood and the wider community that surrounds it. The amendment recognises the impact this development will have over a wider area and ensures that consultation will take place with the broader reaches of the local community as well as the Grangegorman neighbourhood site.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would mean that in preparing a draft of the strategic plan, the agency shall consult with the Dublin City Council, Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the Dublin Transportation Office, C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, other relevant bodies established by or under statute, the local community, including the Grangegorman neighbourhood, and other persons with a relevant interest in the matter. In light of this, the Bill makes adequate provision for consultation with local residents. That section is now strengthened and takes on board what the Deputies are talking about. The provision is included specifically for the residents in sections 8(1)(<i>k</i>), 11(3)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), 11(4)(<i>b</i>) and section 20. There is the communications strategy, the consultancy group, which will include local residents, and the appointment of a local resident to the agency. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has included the local community in amendment No. 43 in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>). In preparing a draft of the strategic plan, the agency shall consult a number of agencies. The Minister is now including the local community in the list that strangely included everything from the Railway Procurement Agency to the IDA and so on and omitted the local residents. Is this not in conflict with section 11(1) which reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Agency shall, as soon as may be after its establishment, prepare a plan.... for the strategic development of the Grangegorman site in consultation with...?</P>
      <P FLI="0">That section excludes any reference to the local community. If the Minister proposes to amend subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) to include the local community, why not amend the opening statement to give the local residents the same standing as the DIT, the Northern Area Health Board, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Minister? I do not understand the omission in the opening <Col N="530" />statement and the inclusion further on in the section. I ask the Minister to examine this aspect.</P>
      <P>The amended version appears to consign the residents to a lesser role in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) when the opening statement refers to consultation but does not refer to the local residents and local community. As it makes no sense to me, I would be grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s response on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wanted to make that point. The Minister&rsquo;s amendment means the local residents must be consulted in preparing the draft of the strategic plan, whereas my amendments would mean there would be consultation with the local organisations on the strategic plan and their plans. My amendment would be included in subsection (2) rather than subsection (3). It would be stronger to include it in subsection (2). All one is doing in subsection (3) is consulting in the preparation of the plan, whereas in subsection (2) one is ensuring that the strategic plan will consist of a written statement and a plan indicating the objectives for the development of the Grangegorman site, including these things. One is including these things in the plan in subsection (2), whereas in subsection (3) one is just consulting. While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, it does not go as far as my amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan raised is covered by amendment No. 33, which inserts &ldquo;Health Service Executive and the Grangegorman neighbourhood&rdquo;. The point Deputy Gregory raised is not covered by that because he wants it to be inserted in the opening statement. The section dealing with the development of the plan and preparing of the draft is much more specific about the particular groupings that must be included. The wording I propose allows for the local community in a broad sense to be included in the preparation of the plan. I understand where Deputy Gregory is coming from. I am not sure there is a conflict, but it is more specific in paragraph (<i>b</i>) than it would be in the opening statement. However, we aim to be as inclusive as possible in subsection (3)(<i>b</i>).</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s amendment No. 28 seeks to include local residents, which I have included. We have achieved the same thing with amendments Nos. 33 and 43. I do not accept this is in conflict with the opening statement because it is included in the other two sections. If it is, I will deal with it in the Seanad. I do not believe there is a conflict but if necessary, it can come back to this House then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would consider the matter when the Bill goes to the Seanad. When the section is amended in the manner in which the Minister proposes, it will appear that the consultation allowed to local residents will be a lesser subsidiary consultation, together with the Railway Procurement Agency and so on, whereas the opening statement is clear. <Col N="531" />It states that the agency shall, as soon as may be after its establishment, prepare a plan which is in this Act referred to as a &rdquo;strategic plan for the strategic development of the Grangegorman site in consultation with DIT, the Health Service Executive and the Minister. The residents will view this as excluding them. I do not think that including the residents will complicate the Bill. It will strengthen the Bill on this occasion. It will give the residents a clear role in the consultation process. If they are excluded from that opening statement, they will feel they do not have a full role in the consultation process. While I do not want to belittle the Railway Procurement Agency or any of the other groupings, the residents may feel, and rightly so, that they are being consigned to a lesser area of consultation.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the points I have made. If she cannot do so now, I hope she will include the residents when the Bill is debated in the Seanad. They deserve to be included in the opening statement in section 11(1).</P>

      <P FLI="0">The amendment seeks to strengthen consultation by ensuring the agency consults the relevant organisations to ensure the functions listed earlier in the section are carried out and has regard to issues such as the provision of public transport.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment because it provides not only for consultation with the relevant organisation but it ensures public <Col N="532" />transport is addressed. Public transport is an issue in the area because Broadstone railway station has been lying idle for many years. The Broadstone line connects with the Maynooth line and it should be developed. However, decisions need to be taken and finance will be required. In addition, the Luas runs parallel to the River Liffey. Will it be connected to the Broadstone line and the proposed metro? It is important that it is emphasised that the public transport dimension should be taken seriously because tens of thousands of students and staff will access the college daily and various activities will bring in other people. We must get this provision right, otherwise the area will be congested with public transport users. The area is clogged up and congested by private transport currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Access to public transport is an important part of the full development of the Grangegorman site, which is why it is provided for in the legislation. I do not accept, however, that the amendment will strengthen the case for public transport. It seeks to ensure the functions listed earlier in the section are achieved and that the agency should only have regard to public transport. However, the functions of the agency and consultation are adequately addressed. Consultation is a strong part of every section.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The amendment refers to accountability. The agency will publish an annual report but annual reports are not necessarily as meaningful as they should be. I seek progress reports because this is a development agency and its work will not be done overnight. It will be progressed over time and it is important that the people involved, the locals and the public can see the aims and objectives of the legislation are being met by the deadlines and that the agency is discharging its functions. It is arguable whether the reports should be produced every six months but I chose six months because a great deal will happen in the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 adequately deals with the question of reporting by the agency. Annual reporting is the normal procedure for agencies. Biennial reports would not be beneficial, as the agency&rsquo;s staff would spend half the year preparing and writing reports. It would also be time consuming and costly. However, I do not see a benefit, particularly since the Bill contains a wide range of provisions for bilateral communication between the agency and the chief stakeholders in the project. Providing for consultation and a communications strategy in the legislation will ensure regular reporting and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the content of the strategic plan, namely, a written statement and a plan indicating the objectives for the development of the Grangegorman site. This relates to many of the issues we have already discussed but I want to include the needs of the local area and community in the plan itself. The list of what should be in the plan is quite long, going from (<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>), but the local community&rsquo;s interests are not part of that list. This amendment will ensure they become so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="535" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment. The action will be found in the strategic plan, where decisions will be taken. The Minister has ruled out the possibility of having local residents consulting with the agency, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the HSE. Having the strategic plan&rsquo;s written statement indicate the objectives is, therefore, important. This objective should be included for it is another attempt to strengthen the community basis of the new college and its inherent and holistic links with the community. We must specify this point.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will say that amendment No. 33 refers to the Grangegorman neighbourhood in terms of provision for needs. If she examines amendment No. 43, she will see that the definition of the local community, including the Grangegorman neighbourhood, is wider. Does the Minister consider that the same type of wording should be included in this section to ensure the Grangegorman neighbourhood is part and parcel of the wider community referred to in amendments Nos. 32 and 43? Including this would be very beneficial as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment would strengthen this section in everybody&rsquo;s interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak about my amendment No. 35. These objectives for the development of the agency are crucial to its long-term success and include tackling education disadvantage and the provision of educational programmes for the local community. The Higher Education Authority report of December 2004 Achieving Equity of Access to Higher Education: Setting an Agenda for Action in Ireland was severely critical of the way in which resources are allocated to improve access to third level. The report called for extensive collaboration between higher education institutions and second level schools. This agency provides the Minister with an excellent opportunity to act on the HEA proposals and make tackling educational disadvantage one of the agency&rsquo;s core objectives. To use the clich&eacute;, my amendment would give another positive role to the agency. It outlines: &ldquo;The provision of educational programmes and facilities for local communities and in particular programmes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage&rdquo;. We have spoken about the community in the area and this amendment strengthens the call made time and time again today in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s amendment and would speak to my own amendment No. 39. This is the section dealing with the strategic plan. The section states: &ldquo;The strategic plan shall consist of a written statement and plan indicating the objectives for the development of the Grangegorman site&rdquo;. It then lists the various objectives. My amendment seeks to add an objective to the list (<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>), namely, the provision of a site for the Dublin 7 Educate Together national school. With Deputies Gogarty and Crowe, I tabled this amendment because the Dublin 7 <Col N="536" />Educate Together national school has been built up from nothing. In recognition of the educational disadvantage and lack of educational opportunities in the area, parents got together and built up a school. The school is in temporary accommodation at present. The parents have sought for sites over the years and have met all the relevant agencies and public representatives, including the Taoiseach. As part of their campaign, they sought a commitment for the provision of the Grangegorman site for their school long before this Bill appeared.</P>
      <P>Other members of the House and I have tabled a series of questions in recent years in support of and as part of that campaign. I submitted Parliamentary Question No. 322 to the then Minister for Education and Science on Tuesday, 15 June 2004, which asked:</P>
      <P LI="1">The timeframe for the exchange of lands at Grangegorman, Dublin 7, from his Department to the DIT; when the necessary legislation will be ready; if provision is being made for a primary school on the site as previously agreed with Dublin 7 Educate Together; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, replied:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is my intention to publish a Bill for the establishment of an agency to develop Grangegorman as a site for education, health and other facilities. It will be known as the Grangegorman development agency. The agency will be responsible for producing a comprehensive plan for the development of the site in consultation with interested parties, including local residents, Dublin Institute of Technology, health authorities, transport providers and Dublin City Council.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Most pointedly, the Minister then stated: &ldquo;My Department has always envisaged that the development of the Grangegorman site has the scope to help facilitate the long-term primary and post primary needs of the area including those of Dublin 7 Educate Together.&rdquo; This was seen as a clear commitment to the House that this would be part of the strategic plan&rsquo;s objectives for the development of the Grangegorman site and that provision would be made for this worthy local school. Regardless of whether my amendment is accepted, I sincerely hope the commitment is honoured. I am sure it will be. In conflict with this, however, there is no reference to such an objective anywhere in the strategic plan. I asked a question of the current Minister on Committee Stage and remember her response but I will ask her again to honour this commitment by placing this issue in the list of objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to amendment No. 37. The Minister stated that we are only dealing with the site in this legislation and that the Bill refers only to the agency and the development of the site. However, in the wording of the strategic plan and <Col N="537" />the written statement, if one does not insert community facilities as well as recreational facilities, one is ignoring the deficit of community facilities in the neighbourhood and the opportunity that the development of this site presents for the community. If this was a development of apartments or an exclusive new marina development, rather than primarily a third level and health care site, one would hear a loud call for community facilities from politicians of all hues. Given the scope and size of this development, the case must be made for community facilities that are not specifically educational, sporting or recreational. The term &ldquo;community&rdquo; should be inserted into the strategic plan wording to recognise that. I spoke earlier in support of Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s amendment, No. 39. I reiterate my support for that, given the major infrastructural problems that the Educate Together school still suffers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 39 deals with an issue that concerns all of us who are living in the area. It is a question that we have been dealing with for some time. It was always envisaged that Dublin 7 Educate Together would be part of the final solution of the Grangegorman site. I, like Deputy Gregory, posed parliamentary questions from time to time to various Ministers for Education and I received similar replies to those given to my colleague.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science envisaged that the Educate Together school would be incorporated into the development. However, that is not specified anywhere in the legislation. Dublin 7 Educate Together has been something of an itinerant educational facility for a considerable time. It has moved from various locations. Thanks to the good will of the Bar Council, it was located in Henrietta Street and then the School for the Deaf on the Navan Road provided it with accommodation. However, the facilities were always cramped and always of a temporary nature, as the school was in place because of the goodwill of the organisations that took it in. Now we have an opportunity to provide it with a permanent base.</P>
      <P>I have organised a number of meetings on this issue, one of which took place immediately after the announcement of the development of the Grangegorman site. The DIT and Educate Together sent representatives to that meeting and everybody, including local residents, was in favour of the proposal that the school would be facilitated at Grangegorman. It is important that provision is made in the legislation and that Educate Together is mentioned explicitly because the other facilities for education and health are mentioned in the Bill. There is no reference to this primary educational facility and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment or to explicitly state elsewhere in the Bill that Educate Together, Dublin 7, will be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s amendment concerns educational programmes and Deputy <Col N="538" />O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to the importance of the provision of such courses. It is important to stress that this legislation relates to the site rather than the college. The onus is on the college to provide educational programmes and it is up to those responsible for the site to provide the buildings in which such programmes can be conducted. It is not necessary to be more specific in this section. The provisions are adequate and it is not necessary to enumerate all of the various facilities needed. I draw the attention of the Deputies to the opening line of the section, which refers to the provision for the &ldquo;needs of the Minister&rdquo;, meaning the Minister for Education and Science. That covers a wide range of educational facilities needed on the site.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to take cognisance of amendment No. 33, which refers to the needs of the local community. This covers the issues raised by Deputy Gogarty. The local community needs are now covered by the legislation, as a consequence of that amendment, under subsection 2(<i>a</i>). Needs are covered in a general sense and it is important that we should not be too specific.</P>
      <P>Various commitments have been given regarding the Educate Together school and it is still the intention that the school will be located on the Grangegorman site. That is what was originally envisaged and that is still the case. The Grangegorman site was always the location being considered for the school. However, if we specify Educate Together in the legislation, we may inadvertently exclude others. At some point in the future a proposal could be made to locate a post-primary school on the site but that might be challenged on the basis that it was not, unlike Educate Together, specifically mentioned in the legislation and therefore could not be allowed.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with Dublin 7 Educate Together and explained the situation to it, namely, that it is still the intention to locate the school on the site but that it might be injurious to another group to specify one particular facility. That is why I do not propose to accept the amendment. It would be counter-productive to the aims of the agency and I hope the Deputies will accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why specific reference cannot be made because the Bill contains a long list of items to be included in the strategic plan. In reference to amendment No. 32, I do not understand why a provision for facilities and educational programmes that will enhance the social and community and development needs of people living in the area cannot be inserted into the legislation. It is not incongruous to insert that provision because there is already a list of items to be included in the strategic plan in the Bill. Therefore, I am pressing the amendment.</P>

        <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
        <P>This is a very important debate which does not arise solely from the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night. This is an ongoing issue that has created considerable concern for a number of people for the last number of years. Much of what has occurred in this area and much of the lack of concern about what is happening here has occurred in the life span of this Govern<Col N="542" />ment. This is why we expect the Government to give clear answers about why it has failed so badly to look after older people.</P>
        <P>Only 5% of the elderly population will end up living in nursing homes so it is vital there are regulations and legislation in place to protect this very vulnerable group from abuse of the kind reported on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Government has done very little to combat elder abuse in nursing homes. The National Council on Ageing and Older People submitted a report on elder abuse to the Government in 1998. A working group was set up which did not report back to the Government until November 2002. The former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, this self-styled champion of the elderly, said on publication of the report that:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">up to recent times, there was a feeling that elderly abuse didn&rsquo;t exist in this country but I can assure you that, as a politician who keeps in very close contact with his constituents, I was aware that there was a problem out there, the extent and nature of which needed to be identified. I will be immediately seeking to have this report formally accepted by Government and I am determined to press ahead with its implementation, starting the year 2003.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Nothing has been done in that length of time. The former Minister of State was merely following in the footsteps of his colleagues in Government because it is not just since 1998 that this Government has chosen to ignore this issue.</P>
        <P>One very important aspect of this issue is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the social services inspectorate, an independent group that can inspect nursing homes. This differs from the current arrangement whereby owners of nursing homes are given prior notice of inspections with very little follow up. What we are discussing has arisen from this regime. The Government gave a commitment to establish the social services inspectorate in the national health strategy, in An Agreed Programme for Government in June 2002 and Sustaining Progress between 2003 and 2005. Yet nothing has been done to protect extremely vulnerable patients in nursing homes. That is the basis of this debate.</P>
        <P>What happens when a nursing home is inspected? It is quite clear that there are limited guidelines about what a nursing home inspector can do and a lack of uniformity around the country in the reinforcements of these same standards of care. Tonight&rsquo;s debate revolves around private nursing homes. I will let other speakers focus more on private nursing homes. Only a small percentage of private nursing homes provide poor standards of care for their residents. The vast majority of nursing homes, both private and public, show great respect in their care of the elderly. However, we have let down a small minority of patients, who in some respects are being tortured in nursing homes, by having very unclear regulations.</P>
        <Col N="543" />
        <P>Does the Minister of State know how many public institutions across the country house their residents on the third, fourth and top floors of buildings? Many of these patients are bedridden or immobile and would not be able to escape if a fire broke out. We have witnessed such tragedies in other countries. Patients are still being tied to chairs. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of Buxton chairs. Patients are put into these chairs, are tilted backwards and are left in them all day so they cannot be a nuisance to staff. There are many other issues about which the Minister of State has done nothing. It is a disgrace and I hope the other speakers will highlight these issues.</P>
        <P>During the deliberations on the Travers report, civil servants were brought in to explain what went wrong with the illegal nursing home charges. An issue that was raised at that time was that despite an amendment made to the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 in 2001 which gave the Minister power to make regulations governing standards requiring convalescent homes to have adequate medical, nursing and paramedical staff and facilities consistent with their patient profiles, no new regulations governing standards of care in nursing homes have been introduced since 1993. We have had reports, commitments, promises about legislation and the introduction of amendments, but nothing has been done.</P>
        <P>I am sure members of the Government would like to see if there is anything positive they can talk about with regards to this issue. The only positive thing they can focus on is that the Government has committed approximately &euro;2.5 million to fighting elder abuse in the last three years. However, this figure has been committed right across the community services and hospital services sectors. On the basis of these recommendations, the Government promised to spend &euro;13.5 million but spent only &euro;2.5 million on elder abuse. There has been total and utter neglect in the care of the elderly and this, especially the abuse of elderly patients, is a disgrace on the Government. We are discussing a small minority of private nursing homes that have been allowed to get away with this. In some respects, they have been allowed to get away with murder.</P>
        <P>Earlier today on Leaders&rsquo; Questions we discussed the case of a very elderly lady who was admitted to hospital. The medical registrar at the hospital said the lady had massive necrotic ulcers in her buttocks, was dehydrated and had sepsis, in other words blood poisoning from infected wounds as a result of being totally neglected in a nursing home. It was the same former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who sought to make representation on behalf of this patient. Luckily, this woman wound up in an acute hospital and survived the massive necrotic ulcers in her heels and buttocks. When the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, received the report did he say this must never again happen under his watch? He did exactly what he apparently did with illegal nurs<Col N="544" />ing home charges. He probably whispered it in somebody&rsquo;s ear and left it at that. This issue was far too serious.</P>
        <P>We have neglected the care of the elderly, particularly elder abuse in many of our institutions. I am very interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say about this issue. I do not think people could believe this type of abuse was occurring until they saw it on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; last night. Those of us who have been involved in medical services know that all is not well.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister gives a clear commitment and not the type of commitment we have seen since 1998, with promises of reports, working groups and legislation that is basically useless. If we cannot close down these places, the least we can do is regulate them properly. Many of them were built on the basis of tax concessions for people who needed some place to put their money. They are not motivated to look after elderly patients but to cut their tax bill. Throughout the country we see what is going wrong. People who are not really interested are being put into this sector and this is the result.</P>
        <P>Serious and enforceable regulations are the responsibility of the Government, and it cannot wriggle its way out of this issue. It tried to wriggle out of the illegal nursing home charges and is trying to wriggle out of this problem. It must introduce regulations and a care of the elderly policy for the future. It must stop stalling, as it is doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG">
        <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
        <P>This is about public service by a public service broadcaster, RTE. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night was wonderful. It was well researched, well thought out and well produced. It showed RTE at its best in terms of exposing what is bad. I commend it on its work. This debate is the result of that work. I wish to put on record my appreciation of the work of the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> particularly Jody Corcoran, who has always published information I receive about nursing homes throughout the country.</P>
        <P>This debate is not foreign to the Minister of State or his predecessors. There was a debate on this in 2001 in the Seanad when I raised with the then Minister the case of a nursing home in County Louth. It was the first one to come to my attention. I got a complaint that a lady was freezing in her nursing home. I went there with her husband and we found the lady in bed, fully clothed and freezing. The home was freezing, with a temperature of 12&deg;C. It was a cold day. The temperature in the home ought to have been at 19&deg; to 21&deg;C. Old people die if they do not have adequate heating but there are nursing homes such as this. The Minister knew that in 2001 but there was no change in nursing home legislation. The system continued as it was and it continues like that today.</P>
        <P>Today, the Taoiseach offered the same pious platitudes as the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the former Minister of State Moffatt, and their predecessors. They are <Col N="545" />aware of what is going on but they do not care about what happens. The T&aacute;naiste made a song and dance about care of the elderly, but where is she tonight? Why is she not present? She ought to be here. This has generated the greatest amount of public concern in recent years about care of the elderly, but no member of the Government is present. That is what the Government does &mdash; nothing.</P>
        <P>This is the Government that changed the Freedom of Information Act and made it more difficult to find out what is happening in our society. It increased the charges for freedom of information requests. In response to a freedom of information question I asked recently about a nursing home, I was informed by the health board that under a section of the Freedom of Information Act it could not give me the information. The reason was that it would bring the health board to a halt. I rang up the person concerned and asked what was the problem. He said: &ldquo;The problem is very simple, I have 1,000 pages here and you expect me to go through every one of them and take out the names of all the people concerned, but I cannot do it and we do not have the resources to do it.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>That is the Health Service Executive we have, and it is not good enough. I complained bitterly about that. I left a message with a gentleman who appeared tonight on the RTE news, Mr. Aidan Browne. He is a senior executive in the HSE with responsibility for nursing homes. When I called him I was told he was not available. I responded that he sends me letters but does not sign them. I asked where he was and was told he was at meetings or travelling. I left my name and asked that he ring me, but a week later he had not rang. He can appear on RTE but he cannot ring a Deputy to discuss the issues. That is what the Minister is presiding over and it is neither acceptable nor good enough.</P>
        <P>There are 423 nursing homes in this country. The vast majority of them are excellent institutions but a significant minority of 33 were given adverse reports last year. They were bad nursing homes providing unacceptable care. In some instances, the care was appalling. What has the Minister done about it? What did the Minister, Deputy Callely, do about it when he was told about it in a letter from Beaumont Hospital? The letter was from a consultant in Beaumont Hospital who was speaking about the worst pressure sores he had ever seen. He wrote the letter in 2004 but the incident occurred in 2001. In the second last paragraph of the letter he said he could still vividly remember how bad the sores were.</P>
        <P>What is happening in our nursing homes? There is another case involving a man in a certain nursing home. There are other nursing homes in the county concerned so I will not mention it although the press has the story anyway. The man died in the nursing home. The health report states that he was in a cold, darkened room. He had nobody with him and had no facility to call any<Col N="546" />body should he need assistance. It took me four long years to get those facts. Why was that? It was due to the Freedom of Information Act, appeals and lack of staff in the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s office. I have numerous examples of and reports on bad nursing homes in this country. I am sick of it, as are the people. They want change. Will they get it tonight from the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children or the Government backbenchers?</P>
        <P>We have reached a terrible stage. I will draw a comparison for the Minister. When I was a teacher, I and my pupils researched the workhouse in Drogheda in 1843. We examined the minute book and the students wrote down information from it which they then reproduced in a lovely little book. RTE covered this at the time. In 1843, people were extremely poor and when they had nowhere to go they went to the workhouse. Under the workhouse system, there were poor law guardians who held public meetings. At the first meeting they held in public, they were fighting about the beige cloth, who should sit in the big chair and so forth. Nevertheless, the guardians had matron&rsquo;s reports and the press reported on their meetings. One can discover from the press reports &mdash; I looked at the reports &mdash; what was happening in those workhouses. The public knew what was happening.</P>
        <P>What do we know now? The Government has put the nursing home sector and the entire health service in the hands of a bureaucracy that cannot be questioned or held to account in this House. Its personnel will not respond when one telephones. If one asks a parliamentary question, one will wait three months for a reply &mdash; I had to wait that length for a reply to a question about a nursing home and I am sure my colleagues in the House have had similar experiences.</P>
        <P>The Government has betrayed the people&rsquo;s trust. It has removed the health boards but has put nothing in their place. Aidan Browne would have rang me when he was an executive in the North Eastern Health Board &mdash; I met him every week &mdash; but he did not ring me on this occasion because he is not accountable to me or to this House. The Government takes no responsibility for what it has done but it stands indicted for delivering the health services into this appalling mess. I accuse all members of the Government of not doing their job and not caring. The mumbled speeches are not good enough. The people want more, they want action.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said today that he will change the law, and I welcome that. On the Order of Business I asked him if the nursing homes reports would be available outside of the Freedom of Information Act. The Ceann Comhairle ruled that the question was out of order. The issue is that the Freedom of Information Act is the only way to obtain nursing home reports; there is no other way to access them. Up to December 2004, if the nursing home objected it could take up to four years to get the full facts. The Information <Col N="547" />Commissioner made a recent decision in this regard, and she is on the record as stating that such reports should normally be available. However, they are not normally available. Moreover, the Government introduced a measure with the result that if one wants to appeal the refusal of the health board, a &euro;75 fee must be paid. That may be fine for Members of the House but it is not for Mrs. Murphy, Mrs. Maguire, John Malone or anybody else. The Government is protecting the bureaucracy through the changes it made to the law in regard to FOI. It stands condemned for that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, knew about the case referred to in the letter from the consultant. He was the Minister with responsibility for the elderly &mdash; that was his job. While he made good representations, what changes to the law did he bring about as Minister? The answer is none. The Government shies away from its responsibilities; its members do not resign. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, ought to resign. He knew everything about the most appalling case of bedsores the consultant involved had ever experienced.</P>
        <P>What should we do? Many people have family members in nursing homes. After all the publicity, they wonder whether their wives, husbands, sons and daughters are in good nursing homes. How they can find out this information? If a family member is in an acute hospital, the hospital staff will probably suggest the family member should go to a nursing home in the area. Therefore, the HSE is sending people to nursing homes its inspectors say are not good enough or about which it has had adverse reports. Will the Government take responsibility for this? While most nursing homes are excellent institutions, how does one discover this information?</P>
        <P>An example may illustrate my point. If one searches for information on nursing homes on the Internet, one can examine information on nursing homes in the United States and the legislation governing them. Two minutes after leaving the Chamber, one could access information on Chicago, Illinois, and find how many nursing homes are within the city&rsquo;s bounds; one would find that there are 56 nursing homes in the area. It is possible to access individual nursing home sites. One of the nursing homes is named Waterford, so, needless to say, I looked at its site. The reports on individual nursing homes detail the number of patients in the nursing home, the staff to resident ratio, the degree of dependency, the proportionality between high dependence and low dependence, and the state and national averages in this regard. It is possible to make a judgment on each nursing home. If a nursing home is not doing its job and the inspectors are unhappy, it is fined on the spot. If a nursing home is not run properly, it will be fined anything from $5,000 to $100,000, or the inspection regime will put in its own people to run the nursing home.</P>
        <Col N="548" />
        <P>That is what happens in the United States. I am critical of American norms and standards with regard to many parts of the world but with regard to nursing homes, they cannot be beaten. However, one cannot find out about nursing homes in Ireland. That is a shame on the Government. It has long known how bad some nursing homes are but has done nothing about it.</P>
        <P>One of the ladies featured on last night&rsquo;s television programme was laughed and jeered at by a nursing home attendant, who pushed himself on her and behaved in an appalling, rude way. She told him: &ldquo;Go away from me. You are rotten.&rdquo; That is what I say to the Minister: the Government is rotten in this context. It knew about the situation but did nothing. People up and down the country are saying the situation is not good enough and not acceptable, and they will not put up with it any longer. At the least, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, should resign. The truth will come out on all of these issues, although it is a very sad and unacceptable truth. We have a big job to do.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the motion is laughable and cynical. It suggests the Government will do everything when it has done nothing. The Government should be humbled. It should admit it was wrong and did not do its job. Yet, it will now try to cod us again.</P>
        <P>We have complaints about nursing homes containing 1,000 pages of names while people are lying without due care and help. A nursing home I know of had 30 residents but only seven fish to feed them. How did it intend to divide that fish? There are nursing homes with hungry and terrified residents. These cases are all on the record. The Minister should ask the HSE about them. The Government claims it will send garda&iacute; to investigate the nursing home referred to in last night&rsquo;s programme. Why does the Government not publish all the reports it has? Why does it not demand the HSE answer to it?</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il is taking off next week because there is a bank holiday on Monday and it is proposed to rise in early July. The Labour Party leader proposed earlier that we should sit for another week to bring in the relevant law. We should do so. We want this situation to change. This side of the House is offering the Government the leadership it so sadly lacks. We will facilitate change in every possible way because it must and will happen.</P>
        <P>There is little else I can say on the issue. I thank my colleagues on this side of the House who supported me on the motion, in particular, Deputy Twomey. The Minister cannot afford to let this opportunity pass; it must be seized. I do not know the contents of the speech the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, will deliver, although I have a copy of it. Its contents are similar to what the Minister said in 2001. I do not have a copy of the speech the Minister made last year when Deputy Olivia Mitchell and I raised this issue, but I am sure its contents are also similar.</P>
        <Col N="549" />
        <P>Things must change; the people demand it. Old people in that nursing home, and other homes about which we know, have endured pain, suffering, hunger and torture. However, their suffering, appalling and awful as it is, may bring about change. Some good may come of their awful pain. However, the change needs to happen now. There must be an end to all of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen">
        <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
        <P>I commend Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd for his emotional contribution. He has obviously put much time and research into this important subject, which has been highlighted by the Fine Gael motion.</P>
        <P>Like most of my colleagues, I recognise that excellent nursing homes exist, providing excellent care, and that many occupants are happy with that care and their surroundings. However, I compliment the makers of last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme for their efforts in highlighting the issue.</P>
        <P>It is sad that the Taoiseach takes a narrow view of the problems highlighted in the D&aacute;il today. Instead of surmising it would be fair to conclude that some other nursing homes have similar problems, he preferred to suggest the problem at Leas Cross is an isolated one. A critical situation exists and people&rsquo;s lives are at risk. The Taoiseach said that nursing home staff have a responsibility to highlight care issues and I hope he is considering legislation to protect whistleblowers. Does he think staff will be thanked by management for highlighting issues of neglect?</P>
        <P>I have visited many private nursing homes in County Clare and the shortage of beds makes it difficult for patients to get into nursing homes for a short or long-term stay. As a result many patients had nowhere to go this winter which put huge pressure on health services throughout the county. There is an urgent need for more private nursing homes in a properly protected environment. However, there is also a need for more long-stay beds and their closure is a disgrace. Some 147 public long-stay beds have been closed in the west since 1997, forcing elderly people into nursing homes and their families to pay huge sums of money for care.</P>
        <P>In my constituency of County Clare the minimum legal standard of two inspections per year was met and the eight nursing homes were inspected twice last year. In the remaining area of the former Mid-Western Health Board, north Tipperary&rsquo;s 13 nursing homes were also inspected twice. In the Minister of State&rsquo;s area of Limerick, 18 of the 20 nursing homes were inspected twice and the remaining two were inspected three times or more during that period. Those two nursing homes received adverse reports.</P>
        <P>The key problem highlighted in last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; was that ultimate sanction does not apply. The law does not allow for nursing homes to be closed for repeated offences. If it did, the Health Service Executive would not have alternative facilities to house the occupants. I am not suggesting that the nursing homes in Limerick <Col N="550" />deserve ultimate sanction. However, such sanction does not exist.</P>
        <P>The figures also highlight that the number of inspections is too low. Last night&rsquo;s programme indicated the laughable fact that nursing homes may not be aware of the inspections in advance. Inspections should dramatically increase when a nursing home receives adverse reports. If the home cannot be closed it should at least be subject to unannounced weekly, even daily, inspections if required. Some might call this harassment, but it is better than the harassment experienced by ill-treated and vulnerable people who have spent the best part of their years building up this State to what it is today. The Government claims responsibility for the Celtic tiger but the foundations of our success were laid by hard-working people, many of whom are now in nursing homes. They paid high taxes on low wages and should be allowed to enjoy their twilight years.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has given assurances on new powers of social services inspectors based on the legislation being drafted. The situation calls for urgent review. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has been calling for such a review of this legislation in recent years to allow for absolute sanctions, the closure of nursing homes, the transfer of occupants, the independence of the inspectorate and the resources required to protect nursing staff should they expose neglect.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, has just left the House and has been replaced by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power. He should, in his contribution this evening, indicate that some measure will be put in place to protect these people who paid high taxes throughout their lives. They are at a vulnerable age and must be protected.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputies Twomey and O&rsquo;Dowd for putting forward this timely motion. We must take action now and it is up to the Minister of State to improve the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
        <P>I compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd. I am glad the Minister of State is present because the State&rsquo;s conduct towards older people is totally appalling and negligent. The whole country experienced shock, disgust and revulsion at the content of last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. It has once again highlighted how the State has failed our most vulnerable. This is a repeat of the nursing home charges scandal, when senior Government figures knew about legal charging of patients in contract beds for the past four years and ignored the fact that the Bill was fundamentally changed in 2001.</P>
        <P>Quality of life for those living in nursing homes is totally dependent on the nature and standard of care they receive. From my experience in Sligo, all the institutions are exceptional and staff take to their calling with care and affection, whether working in private or public nursing homes. Having visited caring institutions throughout Sligo and Leitrim, what was evident on our television <Col N="551" />screens last night was in no way the practice in those counties.</P>
        <P>We must make provisions against those who will not abide by common decency and who treat those they are supposed to be looking after with disrespect. It is shameful that the Government was aware of the problem, yet did nothing. It ignored the problem. The level of State funding for those in private residential care has not increased in 15 years. Subvention is &euro;190 per week, yet the rate of private charges has quadrupled.</P>
        <P>A framework of quality in long-term residential care for older people in Ireland was published in 2000. Its stated objectives were to maintain our elderly in dignity and independence in their own homes, restore the elderly who become ill or dependent to independence at home and encourage and support the care of the elderly in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in every possible way. If our elderly cannot be maintained in dignity and independence at home, we must provide a high quality of hospital and residential care. This is where the State has failed dismally.</P>
        <P>Another report was issued in 2002 by the working group on elderly abuse, entitled Protecting Our Future. It is critical that people who built our future are treated in such a manner. It is 2005 and the Government has not acted. It has spent millions on reports on the elderly but nothing has been done. The Government has failed the medical, nursing and all care professions by allowing a small number to damage the reputation of many good people who carry out fantastic work.</P>
        <P>The amount of money spent by families on the provision of services is extraordinary. Other providers are obliged to obtain quality marks, such as ISO 9000, the IQA award and hotel accreditation awards. The provision of care services is very demanding and can cost up to &euro;1,000 per week, but there is no regulation. Where is the political accountability? Will this scandal produce another Michael Kelly? Will another secretary general have to present his or her head on a plate as in the case of illegal nursing home charges? The former Minister, Deputy Martin, did not accept political accountability, but the current Minister must do so.</P>
        <P>Where is the initiative from the Minister? Long-term residential care is a critical part of care services and should be treated as such. It should be provided to a standard so that residents experience health and social gain from the services. What do people in the 80s feel about going into long-term care? They are hugely concerned. Attention must be focused on quality and effectiveness of long-term care services rather than on the provision of such services to a minimum standard, as is happening. For a small number of people it is about minimum standards and high profit, which is utterly appalling.</P>
        <P>Change and regulation is needed but we do not have either at this time. There should be move<Col N="552" />ment on the part of the Department of Health and Children. The Government has failed the caring profession by not introducing regulation. The vast majority of the caring profession are totally innocent but could be regarded in the same light as those shown in last night&rsquo;s documentary. There is no statement of policy, uniformity of standards, independent inspector or mechanism of quality assurance. Public health carers have been let down.</P>
        <P>This Government should be ashamed of its lack of movement in respect of care of the aged who are the most vulnerable in society. It has failed on the illegal charges issue and it has failed on this issue. We must introduce regulations to promote quality assurances in all private, voluntary and Health Service Executive long-stay facilities.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children gave no leadership or political accountability on this issue. I heard the Minister of State on radio this morning. He cannot pass the buck on this issue. He is the person in charge and he should insist that regulations be introduced forthwith. We do not need to spend &euro;1 million on introducing a report that will be shelved like the five reports going back to 1998 on the care of the aged. It is a disgrace.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">We have taken the necessary action and I will outline that action to the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important and very emotive issue. I was extremely concerned by the findings of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night. It is unacceptable that older people should be subjected to the type of environment portrayed by the programme and I am pleased that the Health Service Executive has reached agreement with the owners of the home to bring much needed improvement into the operation of the facility.</P>
        <P>The following is the agreement arrived at earlier today. First, the Health Service Executive northern area will assign a director of nursing and senior nursing staff to ensure the delivery of the highest standard of patient care in Leas Cross on a 24-hour basis. Second, a clinical governance steering committee will be established. This will be multi-disciplinary and will involve a representative of the residents, their families and an independent expert. The steering committee will oversee implementation of all recommendations. Third, an independent inquiry team will be established to investigate all areas of concern. Fourth, the HSE northern area will explore all options regarding the future management of the home.</P>
        <P>Policy is to maintain older people in dignity and independence in their own homes, and in accordance with their wishes, for as long as possible and to provide a high quality of long-term residential care for older people when this is no longer possible.</P>
        <P>It should be remembered that it is internationally recognised that only 5% of the older population will need long-term care. However, people are generally living longer lives these days and even though most are leading healthy independent lives, the number of people in need of long-term care is increasing. There is huge demand on public long-stay places, and these days there is a growing reliance on using private nursing home places.</P>
        <P>The nursing home sector is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and subsequent regulations. The Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 set out the standards to which the private nursing home sector must adhere for the purpose of registration under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. The regulations only apply to the private nursing home <Col N="554" />sector and do not cover public long-stay facilities for older people.</P>
        <P>However, there was a commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, to extend the remit of the social services inspectorate to other social services, including residential services for older people. The social services inspectorate will be established on a statutory basis and will be independent of the Health Service Executive. Its work will cover both public and private nursing homes and the Bill will be published later this year.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department of Health and Children is urgently reviewing the operation of the 1990 Nursing Homes Act and the Nursing Home Regulations 1993 to strengthen the powers available to the Health Service Executive. This will be wide-ranging with the rights of the patient as the centre of its work. It will update the Nursing Homes Act and regulations so that any issues in respect of employment law, training of staff etc. are reflected in the new legislation. I intend to have this Bill published this year to allow an early debate with all stakeholders on a new framework for all patients in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>
          <?oasys _dc14-?>In regard to information, I regard this as one of the most critical issues to be covered by the Bill. In this day and age it is unsatisfactory for people not to have comprehensive information easily available on services being provided in nursing homes. I will ensure that the new Bill will include a specific provision for easy access by the public to inspectors&rsquo; reports on nursing homes; I understand that is not possible under the current legislation.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
        <P>I am aware that the HSE will develop as a matter of priority a common national approach to the inspection of nursing homes. This work will be facilitated by the fact that the HSE, as a national agency, can more easily implement a common policy than the previous situation where we had ten health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The work can be a useful prelude to the establishment of the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and the application of common standards of inspection.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people can be demonstrated clearly by outlining the resources made available in recent years for service developments. Since 1997 to 2005 inclusive, additional spending on health care services is in excess of &euro;302 million.</P>
        <P>In 2004, a total of &euro;9.5 million in additional revenue funding was allocated to services for older people and for 2005, this figure is being increased to &euro;15.228 million. This funding will be used for a variety of services including the nursing home subvention scheme, home care grants, the home help service, the elder abuse programme and support to voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has piloted home care grant schemes as an alternative to long-term residential care to assist older people living at home in the community. Older people who are being discharged from the acute hospital <Col N="555" />system and those living in the community are being targeted under these schemes.</P>
        <P>In the eastern region people have been discharged from acute hospitals under the Sl&aacute;n Abhaile and Home First pilot projects. These projects have recently been evaluated and the reports of these evaluations will be available shortly.</P>
        <P>The Department has been working with the HSE to develop a national home care grant scheme. A draft of the scheme is currently being finalised by the HSE. Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2005 to introduce the scheme.</P>
        <P>When vulnerable older people have an issue with the service and the contract of care provided to them, it should be safe to expect that there are clear structures in place for them to complain. However, it should also be clear that any complaint would not prejudice the complainant. I note that notices of complaint should be made in writing to the general manager of the local community care area of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In recent years there have been great strides in developing supports for older people who feel defenceless. The HSE advised that the Senior Help Line &mdash; 1850 440 444 &mdash; was established with the support of the health boards in 1998 and since 1999 has received in excess of 10,000 calls from lonely older people nationwide. The service is confidential and non-directive and is available throughout the State for the price of a local call.</P>
        <P>The HSE indicated that there are now approximately 300 volunteers working from nine centres across the country &mdash; all older people who have gone through a rigorous training provided in conjunction with the health authorities.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, the Department allocated funding totalling &euro;72,800 for a promotion campaign aimed at raising awareness of the telephone number of the Senior Help Line. The HSE advised that the telephone number of the Senior Help Line was circulated to all doctors&rsquo; surgeries in the State. Summerhill Active Retirement Association received national lottery funding totalling &euro;15,000 in 2003 to produce a booklet and promote the Senior Help Line.</P>
        <P>In December 2003, the Health Service Executive supported an independent evaluation of the Senior Help Line. This was carried out by Dr. Eamon O&rsquo;Shea of NUl, Galway, and launched last year by President Mary McAleese, who is patron of the Senior Help Line. The Health Service Executive has decided to support the implementation of the recommendations of the evaluation and this implementation is now well advanced.</P>
        <P>The Senior Help Line has responded to issues of elder abuse since its foundation. Volunteers have received specialised training, funded by former health boards, provided by health service professionals specialising in the area of elder abuse, to enable them deal with calls of this nature.</P>
        <Col N="556" />
        <P>Five per cent of calls in 2004 related to elder abuse. These callers establish a relationship of trust over a period with the older volunteers who take their calls and are often unable to seek external or professional intervention until they feel secure in discussing their situation.</P>
        <P>The Senior Help Line has expanded in recent years and three new centres are preparing to come on line later this year. In addition, the Department of Health and Children, through the Health Service Executive, has agreed to support further expansion of the Senior Help Line hours. Later this summer the service will also operate in the afternoons, expanding from a morning and evening service.</P>
        <P>Each Senior Help Line centre provides support material for volunteers with key contact details of health services appropriate to dealing with elder abuse cases where the caller wishes for such an intervention. In addition to the Senior Help Line, the Government is committed to dealing with the problem of elder abuse. In 2003 the Government established the elder abuse national implementation group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of Protecting our Future, the report of the working group on elder abuse which was commissioned by the Government.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;800,000 was provided in 2003, a sum of &euro;750,000 was provided in 2004 and a further &euro;900,000 was allocated in 2005 to continue the implementation of the recommendations of the report. Elder abuse is a complex issue and difficult to define precisely. It may involve financial abuse, physical abuse or sexual abuse, or it may arise due to inadequacy of care. It is defined in the report as &ldquo;A single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights.&rdquo; In defining elder abuse this report will hopefully give older people, who feel they are the subject of abuse in any shape or form, the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to a social worker, a public health nurse, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any professional or care worker.</P>
        <P>It is important that the issue of elder abuse is placed in the wider context of health and social care services for older people. As recommended in the report, multidisciplinary steering committees are being established at HSE area level to provide a common response to elder abuse throughout the State. The primary role of the steering committees is to plan, co-ordinate, support, monitor and evaluate an approach suitable to that particular HSE area. The report recommends that a clear policy on elder abuse be formulated and implemented at all levels of governance within the health, social and protection services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Steering committees are in the process of developing clear policies and guidelines for the protection of vulnerable adults following wide consultations with staff. The committees are pro<Col N="557" />gressing their work through sub-groups on legal aspects, policy and procedures and training. The HSE continues to provide and develop multidisciplinary training for internal and external staff as recommended in the report. The issue of elder abuse is being incorporated into professional training courses, including gerontology courses. A number of research projects are ongoing, including the examination and review of medication in older persons in continuing care settings.</P>
        <P>In general, where problems occur with nursing homes, the inspection team which inspects the private nursing home will discuss its findings in detail with the owners or operators and this will generally ensure that the matters raised will be addressed. The HSE may remove a nursing home from its register or refuse to register a nursing home if it is of the opinion that, <i>inter alia</i>, the premises to which the application or registration relates do not comply with the regulations, or the continuance of services in the home will not be or is not in compliance with the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Mercer Report on the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established following from the publication of the report. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken in that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group has been requested to report to both the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the T&aacute;naiste by mid-year 2005. We expect to have that within a few weeks. Following this process it is the intention that there will be discussions with relevant interest groups.</P>
        <P>In the interim, work has been carried out in a number of Health Service Executive areas, on developing standards for residential care for older people. At the same time the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board has commenced work on examining the development of accreditation standards for both public and private residential care for older people. It is developing a pilot programme that includes both public long-stay units and private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>It will be clear to the House from what I have outlined that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to older people cannot be denied. We acknowledge that we must continue to develop legislation in this area to meet the growing demand for services and that we cannot be complacent about this. The programme shown last night made it obvious that there are gaps in our legislation. It is the desire of the Government that these gaps be filled as quickly as possible and we have given a commitment to the people that we will do so.</P>
        <Col N="558" />
        <P>This morning I mentioned that I would be meeting the HSE during the day. I can report to the House that the meeting took place. I sought a full report on the discussions that have taken place on this particular nursing home. I hope to receive that within a few days. I have outlined the agreement reached with the nursing home that should provide comfort for the patients there. I am also seeking a progress report in one month&rsquo;s time on how the new arrangements are working out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>
        <P>The horror story of Leas Cross nursing home shown last night has left a huge impact on Irish society. People were appalled to see large pressure sores on frail elderly people and flesh sores measuring eight or nine inches, with the holes going as far as the bone. The sheets were not changed so elderly people lay on wet sheets throughout the night. Care assistants shouted and intimidated elderly people, who shouted that they did not want to be dressed or undressed and wanted the care assistants to get away from them. I thought the use of restraining chairs was a thing of the past. There were patients walking around undressed from the waist down and residents walking around gardens at 7.30 in the morning seeking assistance. It was an appalling scenario.</P>
        <P>The nursing home, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children were all aware of what was happening and must take responsibility for much of it. I am not making a political issue of this as I want something to be done. I welcome the statements and decisions made by the Minister of State, but the reality is somewhat different.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The recent report from the National Council on Aging and Older People revealed concrete evidence of discrimination against the elderly in health and social services. This is not new, as there have been a series of reports and investigations by Government and non-governmental groups into services for the elderly. Usually, the Government uses these reports as a shield to protect itself against claims of inaction in improving services for the elderly. I regret this is the route taken in the case, also.</P>
        <P>The delay in establishing an independent inspectorate for nursing homes, which has been <Col N="559" />promised time and time again over the years, is a scandal that cannot be allowed to continue. In the past, people pointed the finger and said Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann were responsible. Since being elected to this House, however, I have consistently raised the need for legislation to address serious problems arising in nursing homes. I compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and the Fine Gael Party generally for having raised these matters. The Labour Party has also raised these issues repeatedly and last night&rsquo;s television programme took the matter on board. On three or four occasions during the past nine months, I have called for the establishment of a nursing homes inspectorate. I furnished the media with reports and sent copies of them to specialist correspondents in various newspapers, but it did not seem to be a sexy issue for them. We were dealing with elderly people who in many cases could not support themselves. I warmly welcome the details that emerged from the television programme last night. I hope that, together, we can improve the environment in which elderly people live.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory requirement to inspect the State&rsquo;s 500 public nursing homes which care for more than 10,000 people. Furthermore, there is insufficient staff to inspect all private nursing homes at least twice a year, as required under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, may tell the media that he has only been in office for eight months but the facts have been well known to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors in the Department of Health and Children, as well as to the departmental officials.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
        <P>The information was there long before that and has been well documented in the Department of Health and Children. In a letter dated 1 December 2004, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in response to questions I submitted, acknowledged that a range of problems had been identified throughout the country by the existing, and totally inadequate, inspection system.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste said these problems included staffing levels and nursing policy issues, maintenance of accommodation standards, hygiene problems and a lack of activity for residents. Elderly people, who would prefer to be in their own homes but who were in nursing homes were taken out of bed at 8 a.m. and put sitting in chairs for the day. They had no activity during the day and were put back into bed at night.</P>
        <P>Other problems included poor record keeping and insufficient or no active involvement by local authorities in fire safety matters. One can imagine that a nursing home could go up in flames leaving 100 people dead. Thankfully, it did not happen but it could have because there were major problems in that area.</P>
        <Col N="560" />
        <P>In the same reply, the T&aacute;naiste told me about a lack of equipment appropriate to clinical practice &mdash; for example, pressure mattresses. Pressure mattresses are the main requirement for dealing with bed-ridden patients suffering from bedsores. Anyone conversant with the needs of the elderly would be aware of that, but it seems that while everyone in the Department knew about it, they did sweet damn all about it.</P>
        <P>According to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply, the problems included discrepancies in the contracts of care. I do not know what that means but, by God, it is another element of which the Department was well aware. Notwithstanding the information available about all the problems identified, nothing was done. Ministers told us repeatedly that the establishment of an independent inspectorate was in the pipeline, yet it was delayed for years.</P>
        <P>One of the main functions of the social services inspectorate is to support child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. However, although action for the elderly was promised for the past four years, responsibility for the elderly was placed on the long finger. If the Minister of State is really concerned about this matter, he should give the House a commitment to bring about improvements. Earlier, Deputy Rabbitte sought to ensure that the necessary legislation will be enacted before the summer recess. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd supported his request. We are prepared to wait until July, if necessary, to ensure that this important legislation is passed.</P>
        <P>Independent inspections might well result in damning reports on standards in many of the State&rsquo;s public nursing homes, including nurse-patient ratios and the comfort of accommodation for older people. These facts may lie behind the State&rsquo;s reluctance to establish an independent inspectorate, but they must be faced.</P>
        <P>Questions regarding the physical structure of nursing homes, as well as allegations of abuse and neglect, need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Last night&rsquo;s special &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation graphically highlighted these matters. The horror story of Leas Cross Nursing Home requires attention and action. We have had some comments from the Minister of State, but who will fund such action? Is the general public aware of the helpline to make complaints about nursing home care, and does the helpline operate across the country? I would like the Minister of State to respond to these points.</P>
        <P>What we saw in yesterday&rsquo;s television programme was not just a case of elderly patients being stripped of their dignity &mdash; we saw a regime in operation that is putting the health and even the lives of vulnerable, elderly patients at risk. The Health Service Executive must take the necessary steps to rescue patients from these conditions, either by transferring them to other locations or by taking over the running of the home. I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in that regard. For some time now there <Col N="561" />have been grave concerns regarding decisions taken by health boards, and now by the Health Service Executive, to privatise health care for people with intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. I refer specifically to decisions taken to discharge such residents from St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane, to Leas Cross nursing home and, pending transfers, to Blackrock, County Louth, and Stamullen, County Meath.</P>
        <P>Mrs. Annie Ryan, who has been a great campaigner on behalf of people with disabilities, has put forward a range of queries which I now put to the Minister of State. What measures are in place to ensure the establishment of standards of care, the maintenance of these standards and their monitoring in private nursing homes? What arrangements are in place for the provision of advocacy for each resident who lacks capacity to make personal and health care decisions, or to manage property and affairs? In the event of failure to deliver the service in accordance with its contract with the HSE, what measures are or will be available to the Health Service Executive to protect this group of citizens who have hitherto been in the direct care of the State through the health authority?</P>
        <P>The residents of St. Ita&rsquo;s were covered under the Mental Treatment Act 1945 and, as outlined in last night&rsquo;s television programme, they have been relocated to nursing homes where there is no independent inspectorate and where the conditions as outlined in the programme are appalling. That needs to be addressed. Many people are unhappy with the manner in which psychiatric patients and people with intellectual disability are being placed in nursing homes without proper care provided.</P>
        <P>There has been no shortage of promises from the Government regarding the needs of the elderly, but turning these promises into reality has proved more difficult. The Minister of State said a good deal about the elder abuse prevention programme promised more than 12 months ago by the Minister of State who at that time had responsibility for services to older people, Deputy Callely. There are various types of abuse that older people have to endure and we know what they are.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has informed me that within the Limerick community care area, which was the responsibility of the Mid-Western Health Board &mdash; Deputies from the area should take note &mdash; a pilot project was initiated to investigate the issue of elder abuse and how it should be dealt with. In the short period of that pilot scheme, 98 cases were brought to the attention of the health board, with 79 being actively addressed. What happened? The pilot stage was completed in November 2003. To date, the Health Service Executive is awaiting approval from the Department of Health and Children to formalise the service through the appointment of the relevant personnel to re-establish this important service. This is a further example of the Department&rsquo;s lack of commitment to the elderly.</P>
        <Col N="562" />
        <P>Actions speak louder than words, and we are looking for action, not promises made by the Minister of State and his predecessors, promises which were not delivered on.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
        <P>I thought this day would not come. Like many people, I watched the television programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; a couple of years ago. In last night&rsquo;s programme there was a chilling parallel to what could have developed. We are talking of different times and different institutions, but what we saw last night was indignities piled on people who were defenceless in their beds. That was shown across the country last night.</P>
        <P>RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night was of some service to the nation. I hope that lessons will be learned from the programme. It shocked people of all ages. Not alone did it show the neglect, indifference and downright rudeness, but, as I understood it, the programme revealed that some patients were paying more than &euro;1,000 per week. An astonishing greed was involved in the service being delivered, and many people saw that in the programme.</P>
        <P>Greed would normally not be associated with those who run nursing homes. The professionals in that area were always proud that their job was to provide a service to the elderly, irrespective of people&rsquo;s ability to pay. As a representative from east Galway, the nursing homes I know of provide an outstanding service. Other Members have expressed similar views tonight and no doubt others will do so tomorrow. I assume nursing homes throughout the country provide an excellent service, but last night&rsquo;s programme posed the question as to how we can be sure. How can we be 100% sure good service is being delivered? I know of people whose loved ones are in the Dublin nursing home referred to in the programme. Until last night, I assumed that many of those people believed the home was all right.</P>
        <P>It is against this background that the Minister of State must do much more. I do not doubt his bona fides in this case, but his predecessors certainly took their eyes off the ball. Was there a sufficient number of inspectors, whether from the former health boards or from the HSE? Were they present to call at least twice annually on all 500 nursing homes? I understand that less than one third of the necessary manpower was available. The Minister of State may say differently tomorrow night, but that is my understanding. People thought they would be safe and that their best interests were being looked after, thinking that as far as the HSE was concerned, the inspectors were their great protectors, but it did not seem like that on last night&rsquo;s television programme.</P>
        <P>I do not know, any more than does the Minister of State, if there is another nursing home with the same low standards as the one featured in the television programme. Are there ten, 15, 20 or 50 such nursing homes? Nothing the Minister of State said tonight gives me any reason to believe <Col N="563" />we are likely to know that in the next month, six months or couple of years.</P>
        <P>Naturally, the Minister of State must take fire brigade action, and I thank him for doing so. I assume a brake will be applied and that what is going on in that particular nursing home will change, but what mechanisms will the Minister of State put in place immediately? It is no good talking of action which will be taken in two or three years&rsquo; time. Much damage could be done if there are more rogue nursing homes such as the one shown up last night. I hope there are not many more like that, but until the Minister of State can enter the House and make freely available the exact information collected on every visit to all nursing homes, nobody can assure us there are not several more such nursing homes.</P>
        <P>I hope we arrive at a stage where we have a mobile, fast and transparent inspectorate which will be single-minded with regard to visits to nursing homes, namely, that its members will visit the homes on behalf of the nursing home patients and nobody else. I look forward to the day I hear the Minister of State talk about that in this House.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
        <P>What was broadcast on national television last night was a scenario that is unacceptable to the Government, Departments and nursing home organisations in general. I suspect what we saw depicted on our screens last night is not common throughout the country. If the programme has done one thing for us, it has provided a wake-up call. It is a wake-up call to the authorities, the nursing home organisations and the public that we must be more vigilant. It is also a wake-up call for politicians. It has taken a programme such as the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special last night to outline what is going on in the country. We should have standards which are up to those the Department and the new Health Service Executive consider should be implemented.</P>
        <P>What was shown on the programme are the shortcomings in our system. If we do nothing else, it is time we introduced legislation or regulations to shore up these shortcomings. The Minister of State, in his contribution to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning outlined the Government&rsquo;s position on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.</P>
        <P>There are hundreds of private nursing homes throughout the country and I am sure they were not very pleased by what they saw in a member home of their professional group as depicted in the programme. I am glad that news reports today outline that the organisation that represents nursing homes does not defend in any way what became evident last night. A number of people told me today that they could not watch and had to turn off their televisions because what was shown was so horrific. Anybody who has had to look after an elderly relation, family member of close friend has had that person&rsquo;s well-being at heart.</P>
        <Col N="564" />
        <P>In a society where in many cases both couples must work, more of our elderly population will be put into the care of nursing homes whether private or public. An international report suggests that only 5% of the elderly go into nursing care. However, with an increasing number of people living longer, we will see an increased percentage in nursing homes. It is timely of the Minister to state that the Government is bringing forward legislation to cover some of the matters shown on last night&rsquo;s television programme.</P>
        <P>We should not overlook the role of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in care of the elderly. Successive Governments have acknowledged the role carers play in their care. In the past few weeks the Minister for Social and Family Affairs outlined a major increase in respite grants for individuals who look after elderly people in their homes. This is an area the Government should examine. It should put more resources into funding carers who save the State incredible amounts of money by looking after elderly people at home. The elderly would prefer to be catered for in their homes rather than being sent to nursing homes, be they public or private.</P>
        <P>The assistance given by carers is welcome and we will see more scope for assistance in this health area. The standard of care given by carers is extremely high and, from a Government point of view, is certainly value for money. Last night we saw that individuals pay up to &euro;40,000 per year to have their relations kept in private nursing homes. We could keep our elderly in their home environment for far less than that.</P>
        <P>The Minister must insist on random inspections for all nursing homes. I think we will see a shake-up in the quality and standards applied by nursing homes as a result of last night&rsquo;s programme. It is not right to give nursing homes advance warning of an inspection as it defeats the purpose of random inspections for the homes to be told they will be inspected at a particular time on a particular day. It is not good enough to say that the reason some homes are given advance notice is that they want the owner or matron to be there. If we have standards for nursing homes, the homes should be available for inspection on a 24-hour, seven days a week basis. I think that will happen.</P>
        <P>The number of private nursing homes constructed in the past five or six years is substantial. Developers and entrepreneurs have seen this area as a profitable source of income. Nursing homes are more than just a business. If business people want to get involved in nursing homes, that is all very well, but they must employ professional health care people with an experienced background in the nursing home sector. They must employ professional nurses and administrators and suitably qualified matrons who have a working knowledge of how to deal with and care for the elderly.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable that foreign nurses and assistants are employed as carers in nursing homes to the extent outlined last night. Our elderly would not be familiar with non-nationals and <Col N="565" />foreign carers and would not have had much exposure to them during their lives. It is unfair to have them looked after by foreign nurses. I do not mean to criticise the standards or qualifications of overseas nurses, but there should be a quota system with regard to the number caring for elderly patients.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2-?>
        <P>As a result of the pressure on couples to work because of high mortgages and the high cost of housing, fewer families, individuals and couples are in a position to look after their elderly patients or relations in the home.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>Yesterday, the Irish Nurses Organisation called on the Health Service Executive to take immediate action to resolve the ongoing nursing shortage being experienced by Kerry General Hospital. According to the organisation, the current shortage is so acute that hospital management depends on existing members of staff to work on their days off to ensure that some level of staffing is maintained. Despite the goodwill and co-operation of staff, wards are understaffed on a daily basis and, therefore, the level of care that can be given to patients is potentially compromised.</P>
        <P>Kerry General Hospital is so under-resourced that it cannot conceivably continue to deliver the present level of service. Services will have to be curtailed if a commitment to provide additional nursing posts is not given. The industrial relations officer of the INO, Mr. Michael Dineen, said yesterday:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our members within KGH are under severe pressure to deliver an appropriate level of care to the patients in their charge due to staff shortages. If the present position continues it will only exacerbate the difficulties being experienced as nurses will inevitably leave rather than continue to work in the current environment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I fully support the INO&rsquo;s call for action to be taken in respect of this serious problem. It is unacceptable that nurses at Kerry General Hospital have to work under such stretched staffing arrangements. The nurses&rsquo; level of commitment has been extraordinary, considering the demanding circumstances and constant pressures of their work environment. Services at Kerry General Hospital will be curtailed if the Health Service Executive does not provide the necessary additional nursing posts immediately.</P>
        <P>The level of understaffing at Kerry General Hospital stems from the failure to take the need for a relief component into account when staffing <Col N="566" />arrangements were being made at the hospital. I understand that a hospital&rsquo;s nursing staff relief component is usually 25% of the total nursing staff level, which is 408 in the case of Kerry General Hospital. When one considers the need for a relief component, therefore, the hospital should have between 490 and 500 nursing staff. I understand that provision is made for a relief component at all other hospitals.</P>
        <P>There will be no student nurses working at Kerry General Hospital this year, because the nursing diploma programme has become a four-year degree programme. Therefore, fewer members of staff will be available to cover for absent colleagues. A number of temporary staff have been made permanent. The relief component should be put in place to ensure that sufficient numbers of staff are available to cover annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave etc.</P>
        <P>The hospital saved a significant amount of money by failing to provide for the relief component when it was determining staffing levels. As a consequence, however, it has to make considerable overtime payments to approximately 45 or 50 nurses each day. I understand that the recommendations contained in an independent review produced by Ms Betty Brady in November 2001 were never implemented. While an implementation group was established in 2001, it ceased to exist the following year when various changes were made in the 2002 budget and it became clear that it was impossible to invest extra resources in staffing.</P>
        <P>There are major problems in the accident and emergency unit at Kerry General Hospital. The hospital&rsquo;s maternity unit needs to be extended. All sectors of the hospital are under pressure. I am sure the Minister of State will give us the HSE&rsquo;s line that the hospital has its full complement of nurses, but that is simply not the case. The INO would not have made such a strong statement if it were the case. The nurses at Kerry General Hospital are totally frustrated. On their behalf, I call on the Minister of State to act immediately to ensure that there are adequate staffing levels at Kerry General Hospital, just as there are at every other hospital in the country.</P>

A nurse from Listowel who has worked in the United States for eight years recently contacted me in Limerick because she wishes to work as a nurse in this country.

        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, which provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive on 1 January 2005, the HSE is responsible for managing and delivering, or arranging to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Therefore, the HSE is responsible for nurse staffing at Kerry General Hospital. I am aware of the concerns raised by the Irish Nurses Organisation about nursing staff levels at the hospital. I have been informed that the southern area of the HSE has offered to meet INO representatives in the near future to discuss the hospital&rsquo;s staffing issues.</P>
        <P>I understand that Kerry General Hospital is staffed in line with its authorised ceiling of 408 whole-time equivalent nurses. I have been informed that there is one unfilled permanent post. There are some temporary vacancies, however, as a consequence of sick leave, maternity leave and other forms of absence. Recruitment efforts are ongoing for temporary nurses. In the meantime, such short-term vacancies are covered from within the existing staffing complement. I understand that services in Kerry General Hospital continue to be delivered at normal levels.</P>
        <P>The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of the Government for some time. Some substantial measures, including major investment in the training of additional nurses, have been introduced in recent years. The T&aacute;naiste opened the new school of nursing at Tralee Institute of Technology, for which capital funding of &euro;11 million has been provided, earlier this month. The school can accommodate 320 undergraduate nursing students. Annual revenue funding of approximately &euro;4.5 million has been provided for such a number of students. The first degree students, who will graduate in the autumn of 2006, should help to ensure that there are adequate numbers of nursing staff at Kerry General Hospital.</P>
        <P>Some of the measures taken by the Government in recent years have produced positive results at national level. There has been a net increase of more than 7,000 whole-time equivalent nurses since 1999. That represents an increase of 26% in the nursing and midwifery workforce in the public health service. The level of turnover of nursing staff has also declined. The most recent national turnover study, which covered the years between 1999 and 2003, showed that the level of turnover decreased by 40% over the five-year period.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the extensive range of measures taken by the Government and the management of the health service, as well as the close monitoring and assessment of the situation on an ongoing basis, will continue to address effectively <Col N="568" />the nursing workforce needs of Kerry General Hospital and the wider health service.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in December 2003 to decentralise the National Roads Authority and the Railway Safety Commission to Ballinasloe and some offices of the Department of Transport and the National Safety Council to Loughrea. While some progress has been made in respect of Loughrea &mdash; 114 civil servants have applied for the 51 jobs there &mdash; little progress has been made in respect of Ballinasloe. Just one of the 69 civil servants who have applied to be transferred to Ballinasloe is currently working for the NRA. No site has been finalised for the offices at Ballinasloe. I have asked on many occasions how many of those who have applied to be decentralised to Loughrea have highlighted Ballinasloe as their second choice. I believe that many civil servants have done so. I ask the Minister of State to give the exact figure, if possible.</P>
        <P>Ballinasloe, which is in a RAPID area and has suffered many job losses in recent years, should be prioritised by the Government. It is a dream town for decentralisation because it has all the necessary infrastructure. It is on the new N6 route and on the main railway line between Dublin and Galway. It is served by the gas and broadband networks. It has low-cost housing.</P>
        <P>It has three new playgrounds, a brand new state-of-the-art leisure centre, soccer, rugby, boxing and GAA facilities, three new hotels with planning permission pending, two recent hotels refurbished, a new secondary school with all modern facilities, a new gaelscoil which is almost completed, a new primary school at an advanced stage of planning, an extension to Creagh school which is at the other end of the town, proposals for incorporating sports facilities, with running tracks and pitches awaiting funding from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. It also has shopping facilities with Lidl and Tesco. It is just 15 miles from Ballinasloe where the institute of technology is located and it is close to Galway city.</P>
        <P>Ballinasloe needs progress in decentralisation. There is so much Ballinasloe can do for itself but the Government can bring decentralisation to the town. I call on the Minister to proceed with the decentralisation programme to Ballinasloe and Loughrea.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
        <P>In the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Transport, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the strong case made by Deputy Callanan. I am pleased to confirm that the decentralisation of Department of Transport staff to Loughrea is among the priority moves in the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="569" />decentralisation programme. This will involve the transfer of the road haulage functions of the Department of Transport from its offices in Park West, Dublin to Loughrea. The core functions of the road haulage division are licensing and enforcement. Licensing section is responsible for the issue of road freight carriers&rsquo; licences and road passenger transport operators&rsquo; licences. International section is responsible for the issue of community authorisations, permits, certificates of professional competence and letters of attestation.</P>
        <P>The enforcement section enforces drivers&rsquo; hours and licensing regulations. The Minister for Transport in the context of establishing a driver testing and standards authority has indicated his intention to add additional road safety functions to this authority. This could involve part of the road haulage functions.</P>
        <P>The central applications facility has resulted in a positive response from applicants for this location. While neither the total numbers nor grades have been identified, the Minister for Transport is confident that finalising the moves will not present an insurmountable problem.</P>
        <P>The immediate priority is to finalise a suitable location and construction of a premises. This work is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works. Once a premises is available, I expect no delay in completing the decentralisation process. It is expected that with the transfer of the road haulage functions to Loughrea, the Minister for Transport will take the opportunity to develop driver tester services and facilities which are available in the town.</P>
        <P>The position in regard to Ballinasloe is less advanced as this has not been identified by the decentralisation implementation group as an appropriate candidate for an early move. The transport agencies identified for transfer to Ballinasloe are the National Roads Authority and the Railway Safety Commission. The primary role of the National Roads Authority is to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads. The primary role of the Railway Safety Commission is to foster, encourage, regulate and enforce railway safety and investigate and report on railway accidents. Both organisations include a significant proportion of professional and technical staff in their numbers and the level of interest expressed through the central applications facility system has been lower than was the case with the proposed moves to Loughrea. Nevertheless, the Department of Transport is continuing to work with both organisations to develop an implementation plan which will see the decentralisation to Ballinasloe as part of a subsequent phase of the Government&rsquo;s programme.</P>
        <P>The rules of the central applications facility promised priority to those who applied before 7 September 2004. When the Civil Service has dealt with their applications, the applications received after 7 September 2004 will be processed by the Public Appointments Service. The process of <Col N="570" />issuing offers is due to commence shortly. To date, the central applications facility has not released any information in regard to applicants&rsquo; second or subsequent preferences.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Wall and Paul McGrath. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which is extremely important to so many livestock farmers throughout the country. It is particularly important in the midlands and in Westmeath, Longford and the adjacent counties.</P>
        <P>The problem of which the Minister of State ought to be aware revolves around the proposed &euro;80 million penalty that Irish farmers face in respect of their 2004 premium payments from the overshoot that occurred at the end of 2004 and which clearly arose from the change to full decoupling, which I supported and which came into effect in January 2005. Ireland made the decision to opt for full decoupling in October 2004, and it was as clear as the nose on one&rsquo;s face that livestock farmers would increase their special beef premium applications under the 2004 premium scheme. This put the cut off date at 31 December 2004, and with such a small window of opportunity to make the applications, the overshoot duly took place.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department estimates that the special beef premium overshoot will be 27% on the nine month special beef premium and 23% on the 21 month special beef premium. The cutback as a result of the overshoot will be imposed on livestock farmers who applied for more than 25 animals under the 2004 scheme. In financial terms, individual farmers are facing cutbacks ranging from &euro;53 to &euro;78 per animal, including extensification premium. These penalties will, in many cases, exceed the net margin per animal which a farmer might make and, therefore, effectively wipe out any anticipated profit for beef enterprises which are already under fierce financial strain and pressure. Why should people who applied for, say, 70 animals in 2002, 2003 or 2004 have a financial penalty imposed on them as a result of the special beef premium overshoot?</P>
        <P>I have been informed that when Ireland opted for full decoupling, the former Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, made it clear that no country or individual farmer would lose out from the changes to full decoupling. What efforts have been made by the Minister of State and his officials on behalf of these farmers to ensure they are not penalised or that they do not lose out in any way?</P>
        <P>The average farmer is likely to lose up to &euro;4,000 per annum. I know a young farmer in County Westmeath who has tried to increase his herd for the past four years. He leased a shed and the cut in his case will be approximately &euro;6,000. This is the thanks he is getting for trying to be progressive, for leasing sheds and buying additional land. It is a devastating blow to this bright, young, energetic and go-ahead farmer and <Col N="571" />to many more who are in a similar position throughout Westmeath, Longford and beyond.</P>
        <P>What solution will the Minister of State put in place to deal with the overshoot problems to ensure that approximately 30,000 farmers will not be penalised? Has he discussed the problem with the new Agriculture Commissioner and, if so, how often? What was the outcome? Was it in line with the commitment given by Commissioner Franz Fischler that none of these farmers would lose out from a financial perspective? Will it be thrashed out with the EU Agriculture Commissioner, or will the Minister of State bring forward his own Estimate to ensure farmers who are already on their knees will not be punished further? I call on the Minister of State to take urgent action now in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time. I met members of Kildare IFA on Monday and they expressed their major concerns that this will have a detrimental effect on farming in the county and the catchment area. I had a discussion with the Minister in the past couple of weeks on the uncertainty in regard to the sugar beet crop and this is a further death knell as far as these farmers are concerned. The average number of farmers leaving farming in recent years is frightening.</P>
        <P>When these farmers met Commissioner Fischler in Goffs, in Kill, before decoupling began, they were promised no losses would be sustained by farmers as a result of decoupling. They cannot understand that, despite a number of meetings with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Commissioner, this matter has not been resolved. I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. As I understand the new Commissioner is coming here next month, this matter must be resolved as a matter of urgency. Otherwise, there will be a further decline in the numbers of people involved in farming. There will be a further loss for mixed farmers in the midlands and there will be significant problems as a result of young farmers not taking up farming as a livelihood.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath">
        <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Penrose outlined, this difficulty arose from the introduction of the single payment which kicked in from 1 January 2005. The Minister informed me in response to a parliamentary question today that there was an increase of approximately 250,000 applications for various premia from the Department arising from the cessation of the payments. Heretofore, farmers knew how much they would be paid when they applied under the various schemes but many will lose a great deal of money under the new proposal. Deputy Penrose and I are aware of a young farmer who will lose &euro;6,000 if the system kicks in, as outlined by the Minister of State. We know <Col N="572" />what is our salary and when we will be paid. However, farmers face a scenario whereby they will not be sure whether they will receive a payment and if they know, they will not be sure how much.</P>
        <P>The Minister has kicked the issue to touch, even though it was clearly identified six months ago and forecast almost two years ago. It needs to be raised with the Agriculture Commissioner and a commitment must be secured that the &euro;80 million involved will be paid to farmers. For example, farmers in counties Westmeath and Longford will lose between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith">

        <P>Ireland implemented the single payment scheme in January 2005. The special beef premium scheme, with the slaughter premium scheme, were the only schemes under which the deadline for the receipt of applications was 31 December 2004. This meant that as many farmers as possible submitted their applications in late December 2004 so that they could benefit from the special beef premium.</P>
        <P>Under the 2004 scheme, applications for in excess of 2.4 million animals were lodged, of which almost 1.4 million were quota animals, that is, first age and bull categories. The application figure in each of the previous three years was 1.9 million animals. During December alone, applications in respect of 930,000 animals were submitted, compared to 600,000 during December 2003. More than 300,000 animals were applied on during the final two days of December.</P>
        <P>The background to this issue is that under the special beef premium scheme each member state has an individual national ceiling or quota. Ireland&rsquo;s quota for 2004 was 1,077,458 animals. This quota is in respect of animals submitted under the first age and bull categories, as there is no quota for second age animals. However, Article 4.4 of Council Regulation EC 1254/1999 requires that a proportionate reduction be applied to the second age category where the national ceiling is breached.</P>
        <P>Following discussions with the farming organisations in late 2003, it was decided that any overshoot reduction would not apply to the first 25 animals submitted by individual farmers. It is important to stress, therefore, that this decision, which was taken to assist small-scale producers, means that a farmer who applied for premium under the 2004 scheme in respect of a total of 25 animals or less will not suffer a reduction. In addition, all other farmers will be exempt from the quota reduction on their first 25 animals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath">

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith">
        <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
        <P>Following the submission of the unprecedented number of applications, the Minister took immediate steps to ensure applications were processed promptly and payment made to farmers as quickly as possible. I am satisfied this <Col N="573" />objective was met. The following were included in these measures to achieve these objectives: the implementation of procedures which resulted in the timely return of passports to farmers to allow them to dispose of their animals after the end of the retention period if they so wished; the processing of applications went ahead simultaneously in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
        <P>As a result, my Department, despite the number of applications received, commenced advance payments on these animals in early March; the decision taken to estimate the special beef premium scheme overshoot reduction which enabled the balancing payments to be made to special beef, suckler cow and slaughter premium applicants. These balancing payments commenced in April 2005 and, consequently, farmers received payments in respect of the three schemes two months before they would otherwise have received them.</P>
        <P>I refer to the impact of the overshoot reduction. The decision to opt for full decoupling was arrived at following careful consideration of all options and following a widespread public consultation process. A persuasive factor in this process was the suggestion that farmers in those member states who fully decoupled would not be disadvantaged during the transitional period. The level of the overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004 and application patterns, both in terms of total numbers of animals applied upon and the timing of lodging of applications, strongly suggest this to be the case.</P>
        <P>As has been made clear on numerous occasions, we are seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner. The Minister has raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions during recent meetings. My Department forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter last month. The matter has been discussed with the Commissioner&rsquo;s cabinet and with the most senior officials of the European Commission. Arrangements are being made for a meeting between my officials and the various services of the Commission&rsquo;s DG Agri. All aspects of the difficulties encountered by Irish farmers and all potential solutions will be explored during these discussions.</P>
        <P>We have availed of every opportunity to press the European Commission for an appropriate solution to alleviate the difficulties encountered by beef farmers in Ireland as a result of the ending of the special beef premium in 2004. I assure the House that the Minister will continue to pursue the matter with the Agriculture Commissioner and Commission officials.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
        <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue. The matter refers to the question <Col N="574" />of supports and, specifically, the back to education allowance scheme, which is successful, despite recent changes to qualifying criteria whereby one must wait six months to avail of the scheme. My purpose in raising this matter is to highlight certain categories of people who are deemed to qualify for the back to education allowance.</P>
        <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Education and Science in March and, in her reply, she stated the categories of people are as follows: those who hold EU nationality; those who have official refugee status; those who have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State; those who have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State or who is the child of such a person and not having EU nationality; those who have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU member state who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed or self-employed in the State or who is the child of such a person having EU nationality; or is a national of a member country of the European economic area or Switzerland.</P>
        <P>That is an all-embracing list but society is ever-changing and many thousands of people have sought status under asylum and refugee laws and international conventions. However, in the absence of a proper immigration policy, they are forced to wait and do nothing while in receipt of one direct payment of &euro;19.10 per week, which is low. This is not recognised as a qualifying payment according to the current criteria for the back to education scheme. I ask that it be considered as such a payment.</P>
        <P>If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to be taken at his word, the parents of children born in Ireland prior to the passage of the latest citizenship Act are likely to be granted status in the near future and many thousands will fall foul of this criterion if their cases are not reviewed in the near future. The next difficulty is that once status is achieved by a person, the six-month qualifying criterion for the back to education allowance will kick in and, depending on when status is granted, it may not coincide with the academic year, about which the Minister of State and the Government should be aware.</P>
        <P>Allowing more people in these categories to qualify for the back to education allowance would save the State money in the long term because, otherwise, their only prospects would be for unemployment, the longer they remain in the State and the longer they must readjust once a decision on their status has been taken. It is inhumane not only to restrict such people to spend most of their days in accommodation centres and refuse them the right to work but to further restrict them from accessing education, which can be gained at a low level in many colleges of further education.</P>
        <P>I have been asked specifically to raise this case by Col&aacute;iste Stiof&aacute;in Naofa College of Further Education which sees its remit as not only serving <Col N="575" />the wider community but serving the community at its widest. I was once proud to be associated with the chairman of its board of management. We must recognise the reality of the new Ireland. I have also been asked to raise this issue by the Cois Tine, an organisation which provides support for asylum seekers and refugees in Ireland in so far as it can and the system allows.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The requests are simple &mdash; make the &euro;19.10, poor payment as it is, a qualifying payment and apply it payment directly; even when people are granted status, do not allow the six month period to kick in and make use of not only the people who are willing to make themselves available for further education and subsequently for higher qualified employment, but the people who are waiting for decisions on their futures and the lives of their families. Give them something to aspire to and to occupy them while the State gets its act together in making decisions on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to answer the question in respect of the role of the Department of Education and Science in this matter. In the further education sector, persons in the following categories may participate on courses offered by vocational educational committees, namely, EU nationals, persons who have refugee status in Ireland, persons in the State as the spouse of an EU national where the EU national has moved from one country to another within the EU to work, persons who have been granted leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds, persons who have permission to remain in the State as the parents of a child born in Ireland and applicants for asylum who have been granted permission to work under the terms of a Government decision of 26 July 1999.</P>
        <P>The arrangements to be applied to non-nationals provide that asylum seekers with an entitlement to work &mdash; those who entered the country before 26 July 1999, who have been waiting at least one year for a determination of their cases and are in possession of a notification of their right to work from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; may be treated on the same basis as Irish nationals in terms of access to vocational training programmes within the further education sector. Part-time courses in adult literacy and English language supports may be offered by VECs under the adult literacy and community education scheme to persons who are applicants for asylum who do not come under the categories I outlined. Such persons who do not have an entitlement to work may avail of free access to adult literacy, English language and mother culture supports only.</P>
        <P>Regarding eligibility for student support, the main conditions of the Department&rsquo;s free fees <Col N="576" />initiative are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Official refugees are eligible on the same residency terms as Irish nationals. Asylum seekers are not eligible under the free fees initiative. The Department provides financial support under three third level maintenance grant schemes and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses. Under the terms of the schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, means testing and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>The nationality requirement applies equally under all schemes and requires that candidates must hold EU nationality, have official refugee status, have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State, have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality, have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU member state who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed or self-employed in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality, or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area, EEA, or Switzerland. Asylum seekers are not eligible to be considered for grant assistance. However, candidates who have been awarded official refugee status or humanitarian leave to remain in the State are eligible to be considered for grant assistance on the same basis as Irish nationals. I am aware that barriers to access to further and higher education was one of the issues that arose during consultation on the education response to the national action plan on racism.</P>
        <P>Following recent discussions with the Reception and Integration Agency, my Department has agreed to establish a steering committee to examine further the Department&rsquo;s response to the educational needs of newcomers to Ireland. A group has been established under the chairmanship of a senior Department official and will comprise representatives of all relevant divisions of the Department. The group will review the Department&rsquo;s response to the education of newcomers to Ireland, identify emerging issues relating to the education of newcomers, propose solutions to the issues identified and arrange for their implementation. One of the group&rsquo;s primary roles will to be liaise closely with the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on educational matters relating to refugees and asylum seekers.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40, 43, 100 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the views of the chief executive of the chambers of commerce. The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker <Col N="578" />nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>It is to be noted also that under equality legislation it is not permissible to determine penalties by simple reference to nationality. In other words, it is entirely incompatible with equality legislation to have separate statutory penalties for breaches of employment legislation based on country of origin. At present, there is no decision to review these penalties.</P>
        <P>Following the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on 12 April, there are now 31 authorised labour inspector posts. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s capacity to ensure that workers receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation and will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. This significant increase &mdash; 50% &mdash; will allow the inspectorate to do much more of what it does best, that is, ensuring compliance with the law and ensuring workers get their entitlements.</P>
        <P>Arising from paragraph 12.4 of the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress and to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, a discussion document was prepared by the labour inspectorate on its mandate and resourcing. This comprehensive discussion document was prepared and circulated to the social partners in January of this year so that their views could be obtained. All the issues raised by the Deputies, including the need for professional support and the role of social partners, are considered in the document. In this regard, and in the light of the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s recent experiences, these issues are under active consideration.</P>
        <P>The discussion document covered the full dimension of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate ranging from the legislative framework right through to the operational aspects and staff development. The discussion document also looked at a range of possibilities around the operation of the labour inspectorate and offered a spectrum of possibilities ranging from a compliance regime where the initiative would move more toward the complainant, with the labour inspectorate offering support, to a model where the right of initiative would be with the labour inspectorate which would conduct a hands-on approach.</P>
        <P>The discussion document, which identifies 39 key proposals, is not prescriptive, rather it seeks to present the arguments for and against an extensive range of issues impacting on the mandate and associated resourcing of the labour inspectorate and its linked business units. In the absence of appropriate analysis, no particular <Col N="579" />model can be endorsed. However, the purpose of its inclusion is primarily to stimulate debate and signal that fundamental changes in approach should be considered. The discussion document has been well received among the social partners with some comments received and others awaited, although initial favourable views have been made known. An interactive phase on the discussion document will get under way shortly whereby the range of choices will be narrowed down and the issues raised by the Deputies will be considered in the context of the review.</P>
        <P>I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Trade statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office are not broken down by company ownership, so it is not possible to say precisely what the ratio of exports from the multi-national sector to exports from the indigenous sector is. However, Forf&aacute;s conducts an annual business survey of economic impact, the ABS, which analyses,<i> inter alia</i>, exports by company ownership. This survey is conducted among the client companies of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and covers both merchandise exports and services exports. For those reasons its scope is different from the CSO trade statistics.</P>
        <P>The ABS for 2003, the last year for which statistics are available, showed that indigenous exporters accounted for approximately 11.4% of total exports surveyed, or &euro;9.3227 billion of the survey total of &euro;81.8057 billion. In 2000, indigenous exports accounted for approximately 12.5%, or &euro;9.0964 billion, of the total of &euro;72.5728 billion surveyed. Indigenous exports accounted for 11.8% and 11.2% of the totals for 2001 and 2002, respectively.</P>
        <P>It is possible that the proportion of indigenous exports as a proportion of the total is higher than indicated in the ABS, as a number of large Irish companies with substantial exports are not counted among the clients of the State agencies on whose behalf the ABS is conducted. The survey suggests that after a slight decline in the years 2001 and 2003, the proportion of exports accounted for by indigenous companies has begun to rise again.</P>
        <P>This Department is working with the CSO to enhance the available trade statistics so that <Col N="580" />greater information on trade by company ownership can be obtained. At the moment, I am not in a position to say when this work will be completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>Based on information obtained by the Health and Safety Authority from the Revenue Commissioners, there are about 113,000 registered businesses in Ireland with fewer than ten employees and a further 18,000 businesses with between ten and 49 employees. In addition, there are 114,000 people working in agriculture and forestry, many being self-employed. Given their size and the fact that many are family-run, these workplaces are least likely to have formal management processes, including basic safety management practices, in place, yet such workplaces may be exposed to potentially greater risk than larger more formal enterprises where compliance with occupational safety and health provisions is better managed.</P>
        <P>During 2004, the Health and Safety Authority carried out 6,342 inspections in workplaces having 15 employees or fewer, representing 71% of total inspections for the year. It is disturbing to learn that 37% of the companies inspected had not complied fully with the safety statements requirements.</P>
        <P>The safety statement is a key provision of both existing legislation and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004 which is before Seanad &Eacute;ireann where Committee Stage recently concluded. It involves the essence of safety management in that in the preparatory work employers must identify hazards and assess the risks presented by any hazards in the place of work. Having done so, every employer must prepare a safety statement which also sets out the protective and preventive measures necessary. The bulk of safety management revolves around this process and it is therefore of vital importance that there is 100% compliance with the safety statement requirement.</P>
        <P>Taking account of the practical difficulties faced by many small employers in meeting the safety statement requirements, the Bill provides a basis whereby employers employing three persons or fewer can, in future, comply with the safety statement obligations if they meet the requirements of such relevant sectoral or other code or codes of practice as may be published by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>In 2004, labour inspectors of my Department undertook 462 inspections under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. So far this year, the inspectorate has undertaken 168 inspections under the legislation. Inspectors operate on the basis of achieving compliance. Where an inspection occurs leading to a detection of infringements, the employer is required to rectify the infringements detected. Failure to do so to the satisfaction of the labour inspectorate within a specified period results in the initiation of legal proceedings. The Deputy may be aware that rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission &mdash; a body independent of my Department &mdash; also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Arising from the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress agreed by all parties, in June 2004, the inspectorate was asked to draw up a discussion document for the social partnership process. It did so by identifying 39 key proposals, including proposals relating to staffing of the inspectorate. The purpose of the discussion document is primarily to stimulate debate and signal that fundamental changes in approach should be considered. Some views have been received from the social partners while others are awaited.</P>
        <P>On 12 April 2005, the Minister announced that he is appointing additional labour inspectors who will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. The group will consist of a team leader and ten labour inspectors. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s capacity to ensure that workers in these sectors receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation. This expansion of the inspectorate will bring the authorised number of labour inspectors to 31.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 48, 105, 106, 113 and 264 together.</P>
        <P>All the questions centre around the issue of workplace bullying. An expert group was established in August 2004 under the auspices of my Department. The group was widely representative of the social partners, the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the Western Health Board, a solicitor, human resources practitioners, Trinity College Dublin and a representative of my Department. The group was chaired by a senior manager of IBM Ireland.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the group were to advise and report to the Minister within three months on the effectiveness of measures relating to the prevention of workplace bullying; the identification of improvements in procedures; and how to address the contribution made by bullying to the incidence of workplace stress.</P>
        <Col N="583" />
        <P>The final version of the group&rsquo;s report was received by e-mail in my Department on Tuesday, 24 May last. I am considering it and will bring forward proposals for consideration by the Government. I expect that the Government will then publish the report and announce its intentions for implementation of the group&rsquo;s recommendations. I expect that the Government will be in a position to do this by the end of June.</P>
        <P>The latest available figures on the problem of workplace bullying are from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which conducted a survey in the year 2000. The ESRI survey found then that 7% of persons in the workplace say that they were bullied. This means in terms of absolute numbers that at the time of the survey in 2000 approximately 115,000 persons were experiencing bullying in the workplace. This figure breaks down as a total of 52,000 males and 63,000 females.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority, which has an anti-bullying response unit, reports having received 3,670 calls last year on workplace bullying. There are three codes of practice in operation to deal with the problem. These codes were formulated by the Labour Relations Commission, the Health and Safety Authority and the Equality Authority.</P>

        <P>As I announced on 10 November last, F&Aacute;S employment programmes, which comprise community employment, social economy and job initiative, will provide 25,000 places overall in 2005. I am informed by F&Aacute;S that the number of participants on CE was 24,992 on 1 January 2003, 19,848 on 1 January 2004 and 22,194 on 1 January 2005. During 2004 there was an increase of 2,346 participants on the CE scheme. F&Aacute;S anticipates that the numbers on the scheme by year end will be broadly in line with the January 2005 level.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the community employment programme is to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups to enable participants to advance successfully to employment in the open labour market. F&Aacute;S also endeavours to ensure that local communities are supported in the delivery of services, particularly as regards health, child care and the drugs task forces, which have <Col N="584" />been ring-fenced and maintained at the 2002 levels. The change in the limit on participation from three to six years for the over 55s which I announced in November should help to ensure that there will be sufficient people available to fill the available places. There are no further changes planned regarding the eligibility criteria for the scheme.</P>

It is the case that this is but one of three separate recommendations contained in the group&rsquo;s report in relation to the alcoholic drinks sector. The consumer strategy group&rsquo;s report is comprehensive, covers most sectors of the economy and contains more than 30 separate recommendations whose implementation will involve a variety of different Departments and agencies. To ensure that there is a co-ordinated response to all the CSG&rsquo;s recommendations, the Government is establishing a high level interdepartmental committee to examine the recommendations and to report back with a detailed implementation plan within three months. The group&rsquo;s recommendations on the alcoholic drinks sector will obviously be considered by the interdepartmental committee as part of its deliberations.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 290 and 291 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the recent announcement by Magna Donnelly Electronics Limited of a major restructuring and upgrading of its plant in Naas that will involve redundancies and of the other companies that closed in Celbridge and Naas in 2004. I understand that Magna Donnelly has decided to choose Ireland as the international manufacturing site for its next generation electronic mirrors and that this will involve substantial new capital investment at its Naas plant. This is expected to ensure the long-term future viability of the plant. The company employs 480 people at its Naas facility and 235 people will be employed following the restructuring.</P>
        <P>The 245 redundancies are expected to be achieved through a voluntarily redundancy and early retirement scheme. The company intends that the restructuring plan will be implemented before the end of 2005. Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for the industrial development agencies. Already, F&Aacute;S has made available its full range of support services including training provision and a career planning process for the staff affected. The State development agencies continue to market and promote Naas and County Kildare as a whole for employment creation and investment.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is working with its existing base of companies with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities, which strengthen their presence in the county. In addition, IDA Ireland targets potential new investment projects and there have been two site visits hosted by IDA <Col N="588" />Ireland to County Kildare over the past two years.</P>
        <P>Recently, I opened the new International Fund Services (Ireland) Limited office in Naas, the company&rsquo;s second operation in Ireland. This facility is on target to employ 140 people by the end of 2005 and 240 by the end of 2006. The county continues to thrive across a broad range of activities in the housing, commercial, services and industrial sectors. As a result, many job opportunities are being created within the county. The population of the county continues to grow ahead of the national average and, last year, significant overseas investments were announced by both Intel and Hewlett Packard. Other overseas companies in the county such as Wyeth Medica, Oral B, Tegral Products and Athy Concentrates continue to provide significant job opportunities. Similar opportunities are being provided by the services and local industrial sectors.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in assisting client companies based in Naas to grow and develop their businesses. The agency&rsquo;s activity in terms of job creation is focused on supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs and in enhancing innovation capability at a national and regional level.</P>
        <P>Between 2002 and 2004 Enterprise Ireland approved more than &euro;3.4 million in support to 22 companies in the Naas area and since the beginning of 2002, it has approved &euro;9.3 million for companies in County Kildare to help them grow their sales, improve innovation and develop new products in order that they can compete on world markets. Green Isle Foods announced in January 2005 a major expansion investment due to begin production this autumn, supported by Enterprise Ireland, which will lead to the creation of 130 new jobs from a current base in Naas of approximately 630.</P>
        <P>I am aware of instances of manufacturing jobs relocating to lower cost economies. A more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably attract some firms that are unable to produce in the high wage environment of modern industrial economies like ours. The continuing structural transformation of our economy is economically inevitable and some plant transfers and other adjustments are bound to happen, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to low-technology activities. The enterprise support agencies under my Department have adjusted their support strategies to meet both the needs of society and of businesses in terms of high quality employment opportunities. They have had a good deal of success in attracting higher value replacement enterprises, in line with our policy of moving enterprise in Ireland up the value chain to the higher value output of products and services. Sustainable employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy and that are <Col N="589" />therefore less likely to relocate on the basis of competitive influences.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, will continue to maximise sustainable job creation and investment opportunities. The capacity of our economy to expand quality employment opportunities consistently, not only for our own labour force but for thousands of immigrants as well, strongly suggests that we have significant competitive strengths in the global context.</P>

        <P>These questions relate to a particular company which has been the subject of an investigation by <Col N="590" />the labour inspectorate of my Department. As the Deputies will be aware, the labour inspectorate report is subject to proceedings before the High Court. Accordingly, I am constrained from elaborating further on issues which arise in the context of the report. The report has been forwarded to the Garda and other bodies which have prosecutory powers in the State. The labour inspectorate is continuing its investigations and if any breaches of employment legislation are found, they will be fully pursued. A number of workers have obtained access to money held in the Dutch bank account and the position of other workers is being pursued.</P>
        <P>Three labour inspectors, with assistance from two senior officials, have been engaged full-time in the investigation since its commencement in February 2005. Some 14 inspectors are engaged in other ongoing inspections.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>On 24 May, I announced that the Government had agreed to the following programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies, the Labour Court, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Relations Commission rights commissioner service, and my subsequent consultations with the various interested parties: the establishment of an employment rights group, ERG, comprising representatives of the Department, the employment rights bodies and the social partners. This group will consider and advise on the operational implications of giving effect to the Government&rsquo;s decisions in this area. A customer focused working group will be established in each of the bodies reviewed, as recommended by the report of the review group.</P>
        <P>These working groups will address issues identified by the review group in the context of improving the delivery of service by the individual employment rights bodies. The ERG is to consider how best to simplify and streamline the complaint, appeal and enforcement procedures and documentation across all the various employment rights bodies. The ERG will also examine the extent to which common procedures and a simplified approach to the conduct of hearings-investigations can be adopted across all the bodies, leading to procedural simplification and improved customer service. The ERG will examine the practicality of setting up a single point of contact for the Labour Court, the rights commissioner service and all other services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, not only for information provision, but also for receipt and distribution of requests for service. In this context, the Govern<Col N="592" />ment has directed that all efforts be made to concentrate the relevant employment rights bodies in a single physical location to optimise synergies, efficiencies and improved customer service delivery.</P>
        <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, will continue as a stand-alone body, but one which will have full and part-time members. In addition, all cases which are heard in the EAT on a first instance basis will instead be referred to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission in the first instance, thus making the EAT an exclusively appellate body. A programme of work is to be undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General to simplify, harmonise and consolidate the corpus of employment rights legislation. This programme, to be assisted by the ERG, will bring forward proposals for a coherent and consolidated corpus of legislation for consideration by Government. This will not involve changes in statutory employment rights entitlements or affect the adjudicative independence of the employment rights bodies. Future appointments to the position of rights commissioner in the LRC and chair and vice-chairperson in the EAT will be made by way of open competition. In this context, the Government has directed the ERG to consider the job specifications and terms and conditions appropriate to these positions.</P>
        <P>The report of the review group and also the report of the independent assessor employed for the consultation phase are available on the website of the Department of Enterprise,Trade and Employment, <i>www.entemp.ie/employment/rights/<?oasys _jy?>publications.htm</i>. The first meeting of the employment rights group is to take place on 13 June 2005 and its work should be completed in 18 months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>A number of factors can impact on a person&rsquo;s decision to work past the age of 65, including the availability of flexible work options and pensions issues. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who has responsibility for pensions policy, has recently asked the Pensions Board, in its review of national pensions strategy, to examine innovative ways of encouraging and allowing people to voluntarily work longer.</P>
        <P>In addition, the recently published report of the forum on the workplace of the future recommends the development of a policy framework that removes the barriers to the continued participation in the workforce and facilitates older workers who wish to remain in the workforce. This recommendation will be considered by the high level group established to oversee the appropriate implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
        <P>The OECD is also currently undertaking a review of policies for older workers in Ireland. This review will form part of a larger synthesis report for various OECD countries. The outcome of this review, which will be available in the autumn, will help to inform future policy direction in this area.</P>
        <P>From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are conscious of the need to ensure the continued availability of employees in order to meet the needs of our economy. Creating the right environment to improve participation levels among all workers, including older workers, is increasingly becoming a key factor. The emphasis in the past has been towards those outside the workforce. However, in the light of future demographics, among other things, greater emphasis is now being put on increasing the skill levels of low skilled employees and in-company training. In this regard, the F&Aacute;S training budget has been significantly increased in 2005 by &euro;65 million. Investment in training by employers and the develop<Col N="594" />ment of programmes to facilitate both the unemployed and employees adapt their skills through further training and reskilling is critical to future employment growth and continuing employment for older workers.</P>
        <P>The availability of a flexible working environment can also influence a person&rsquo;s decision to participate in the labour market. The national framework committee on work-life balance policies, which my Department chairs, has been given a specific remit to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work-life balance at the level of the enterprise. This committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Departments. The committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities, including the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, and research activities.</P>

        <P>As regards corporate form, apartment complex management companies are generally constituted as companies limited by guarantee under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the relevant provisions of company law.</P>
        <P>The operation of such companies under their relevant memorandum and articles of association, including the employment of any property manager or management entity, is a matter for their members, who are the owners of the properties in question.</P>
        <P>The company law review group is currently reviewing the legal provisions relating to companies limited by guarantee with a view to simplifying the law in this as in other areas of company law. I understand that among its recommendations it is likely to propose that: there should be no limitation on the maximum number of members a guarantee company may have; and an audit exemption provision should be introduced for guarantee companies. I anticipate bringing the comprehensive set of proposals emerging from the review group to Government for approval to draft a Bill later this year.</P>

        <Quest>if his Department is aware if other State agencies face a similar predicament to that of IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that led to the passing of the Landlord and Ten<Col N="595" />ant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The urgent passing of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005 was necessary to protect the interest that the State holds in property that has been acquired for industrial development purposes by IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta by including these bodies among the State authorities that are not bound by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978.</P>
        <P>An application to the county registrar brought to light the fact that a legitimate scheme could be devised whereby sub-leases created by lessees could establish an entitlement for the sub-lessee to acquire the freehold interest in a property thereby extinguishing restrictive user covenants in the head lease. This had implications for the way in which the industrial development agencies could manage their properties.</P>
        <P>In the relatively short period between my Department first bringing my attention to the issue on 13 April 2005 and the presentation of the Bill before the Oireachtas on 19 May 2005, legal advice was obtained and the Departments that were directly involved were consulted. In the course of this consultation, my Department was not made aware of any other State agency or body that would be in a similar predicament.</P>
        <P>However, the day after the Bill was passed into law, the Secretary General of my Department felt it was prudent to write to the Secretaries General of the other Departments informing them of the background to the legislation. He also highlighted the fact that during the debate in the Oireachtas a number of contributors had raised the issue of whether other State bodies and agencies might be affected in the same manner as the industrial development agencies and if further legislation would be required. It is now a matter for each Department to consider the position of the agencies under their remit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I have not received a request from the Director of Consumer Affairs to amend the law along the lines suggested by the Deputy. <Col N="596" />The director and my Department have received queries about correspondence received by people informing them that they had won prizes and that they had to use premium phone lines to collect or verify their prizes. In most cases no prizes were forthcoming.</P>
        <P>However, I can confirm that the legal advice available to the Director of Consumer Affairs indicates that these schemes do not come within the scope of existing consumer law. My Department is, however, conducting a review of the entire body of consumer legislation in order to consolidate and modernise it. This project will also involve the transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive recently adopted by the European Council. I have asked my officials to examine whether or not measures to counter these sorts of activities might be possible or appropriate in the context of this review.</P>
        <P>In so far as these competitions purport to be lotteries, they are covered by the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 1986 which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under this legislation any such competition which is not specifically permitted under the legislation is prohibited. Furthermore under section 22 of the Act, publication of any notice or announcement concerning a lottery other than announcements of the results of a lawfully conducted lottery is prohibited. The investigation of specific complaints in relation to breaches of the law are a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.</P>
        <P>The principal characteristic of these competitions appears to be the use of premium phone lines. Premium rate phone and text services are regulated by Regtel, the regulator of premium rate telecommunications services. Prior authorisation for the use of premium rate calls is required from Regtel. Promoters are also required to abide by Regtel&rsquo;s code of practice. I understand that Regtel has sanctioned offenders in the past by refusing them permission to use premium rate lines. Complaints in connection with premium rate services can be directed to Regtel. Again, I have no direct responsibility for Regtel which is a private, industry funded regulator.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, which are also the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are designed to ensure that people who do not wish to receive direct marketing literature should have their privacy respected. Under section 2(7) of the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended, individuals have the right to have their details removed from a direct marketing database. Individuals can contact the Irish Direct Marketing Association, the representative body for direct marketers in Ireland, to ask for their details to be removed from the marketing databases of the main direct marketers in Ireland and they should receive fewer unwanted mailings.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>The Minimum Wage Act applies to employees who work under a contract of employment in Ireland. Such workers are covered by Irish employment rights legislation by virtue of section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 which provides that the full range of Irish employee protection legislation applies to foreign workers posted to work in, or otherwise working in this country. However, where a ship is registered in another country the workers on that vessel have access to the employment legislation of the registering country only.</P>
        <P>In regard to recent media reports regarding workers employed on the <i>MV Normandy</i>, this vessel is not registered in Ireland and I understand that a ship management agency recruits, employs and manages the ship&rsquo;s staff on this service. Where the terms and conditions of employees are concerned the flag state, that is, the state where the ship is registered, has the exclusive rights to exercise legislative and enforcement jurisdiction over its ships on the high seas.</P>
        <P>The situation was different in the case of the Filipino beautician working on the <i>MV Isle of Inismore </i>as the vessel is registered in Ireland. This lady was employed by an employment agency based in Singapore. An accommodation was achieved between this person and her employer in relation to the termination of her engagement. An employer should always ensure a work permit is obtained in advance of engaging a non-EEA national.</P>
        <P>My Department regulates licensed employment agencies in the State and any complaints about specific agencies are followed up. At present foreign employment agencies, which operate from abroad, are not required to hold an employment agency licence under the Employment Agency Act 1971. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the Employment Agency Act 1971. As part of the above review <Col N="598" />my Department is currently finalising a policy paper and is also consulting with the Office of the Attorney General on some of the details. The policy paper will shortly be circulated to the various interest groups for further comment. Following the second round of consultations, my Department will draft the heads of a Bill and seek Government approval to have a Bill drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Council to the Government. I hope to publish the Bill by early 2006.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the growing lack of competitiveness in manufacturing industry with resultant relocation to lower wage economies; if he has taken steps to address this issue having particular regard to the number of such manufacturing jobs lost to this economy in the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Competitiveness is an issue of national importance that deserves careful monitoring and corrective policy intervention where necessary, but it must be pointed out that competitiveness does not affect the manufacturing sector alone. An uncompetitive economy will never be able to consistently create employment and increase its citizens&rsquo; standard of living. While I recognise that manufacturing employment has declined by around 25,000 in the past five years, sound and supportive business policies have enabled enterprise to create almost 182,000 jobs in the same period. Approximately 65,000 of these jobs were created in the past year alone. The capacity of the economy to consistently expand quality employment opportunities, not only for our own labour force but for thousands of immigrants as well, strongly suggests that we have significant competitive strengths in a global context.</P>
        <P>Clearly, a more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably attract some firms that are unable to produce in high wage, high reward economies such as ours. The continuing structural transformation of our economy is inevitable as high value added services and related activities increasingly become the wealth and employment drivers in the economy. With this evolution, some plant transfers and other adjustments are bound to come, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low technology, labour intensive activities &mdash; those least suited to the economy we have become.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years the enterprise support agencies under my Department have been mandated to adjust their support strategies to meet both the needs of society in terms of high quality employment opportunities and the more sophisticated needs of businesses that generate and sustain those jobs. As part of our determinedly pro-<Col N="599" />business support environment, for example, I recently asked Enterprise Ireland to rethink how it could better support indigenous firms in managing the challenges of enterprise growth and globalisation. This policy review has been guided by the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group and culminated in a new strategic direction for Enterprise Ireland that I launched at the beginning of the month. As part of this transition, Enterprise Ireland launched a &euro;20 million productivity improvement fund to help indigenous firms invest in technology, equipment and employee training. In boosting productivity, this new programme will considerably strengthen the competitive position of Irish industry by increasing firms&rsquo; value added output, making them less susceptible to cost pressures and giving them the capacity to grow and expand against global competition.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>Some 16 investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997. In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of <Col N="600" />the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
        <P>Some 11 investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>In regard to the three remaining section 19 investigations, I refer Deputies to my answers of 8 and 24 February 2005 in reply to several questions on this matter and to my reply today to Deputy Rabbitte in response to Question No. 88.</P>
        <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to approximately &euro;10.9 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Of the &euro;10.9 million expended, &euro;1.6 million relates to section 19 investigations by authorised officers and the remaining &euro;9.3 million was incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 &mdash;&euro;5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
        <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of &euro;1.25 million in favour of the State.</P>
        <P>In the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which had borne the costs of the investigation, has received payment of those costs from National Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>Section 19, as originally enacted, did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 93 and 268 together.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland, including its regions and areas. While I may give general policy directives to the agency under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for Kerry is to win high value investments in the international services, engineering and ICT sectors. Such investments, be they greenfield or expansion of existing operations, are often related to research activities and require high level skills, infrastructure and business services. The result of such investment is that it generates more high value products, services and higher paid jobs. IDA Ireland is pursuing this strategy within the national spatial strategy which has designated Tralee and Killarney as linked hubs. The objective is to create the environment that is demanded by overseas investors.</P>
        <P>To continue to improve the attractiveness of south Kerry as a location for inward investment, IDA Ireland has completed site development works on its business and technology park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry. The site area totals 4.66 hectares and the work involved significant landscaping, access development and site clearance, all of which has resulted in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location. The work undertaken has cost in the region of &euro;1 million. In addition, a local group of business people have completed a new building of 14,716 sq. ft. on a site acquired from IDA Ireland on this park. IDA Ireland is actively marketing this facility to potential investors but to date no client interest has been expressed.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has responsibility for the provision of property solutions in north Kerry. IDA Ireland is actively marketing the Kerry technology park, KTP, adjacent to the Institute of Technology, Tralee, and also the Listowel development centre, as property solutions to potential overseas investors. Since 2000, there <Col N="603" />have been a total of 13 visits to the Kerry area by IDA Ireland client companies, nine of which have included Tralee in their itinerary and four of which have visited Listowel.</P>
        <P>Fundamental to regional success is the quality, calibre and drive of the third level education infrastructure in the region. Universities and institutes of technology are the foundations for development of more advanced economies. Kerry is well served by its progressive and forward thinking institute of technology in Tralee. IDA Ireland continues to work closely with this institute in the development of new areas of opportunity through the IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategic business group and towards greater industry collaboration and research through its education skills and research group.</P>
        <P>In addition to targeting potential new projects, the agency is also working with its existing portfolio of companies in the region, with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004, there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA Ireland-supported companies in County Kerry. I am pleased that three new projects were announced in Kerry in 2004 namely Dollinger (Ireland), Liebherr Container Cranes Limited and Fujisawa.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiative by IBEC in undertaking a review of economic development in the county. I note from the report, Securing Kerry&rsquo;s Future, that there are challenges to be overcome in the provision of infrastructure and in the development of the necessary conditions for business to grow in the region. In this regard, it is my intention to visit the Kerry area as soon as my departmental and parliamentary commitments permit and I look forward to discussion with the local chambers of commerce and other interested groups about employment prospects specifically and economic development generally in the region.</P>

The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>I recently announced that I am appointing additional labour inspectors who will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. The group will consist of a team leader and ten labour inspectors. This significant increase of 50% in its staffing will allow the inspectorate to do a lot more of what it does best &mdash; ensuring that compliance with the law and ensuring workers get their entitlements.</P>
        <P>I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>The United States is a key export market for Irish owned companies, which exported over &euro;1 billion to the market in 2004. It is a powerful global economy and leading in many industries and remains an essential market for Irish companies seeking to grow an international presence.</P>
        <Col N="606" />
        <P>I led a trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland to New York, New Jersey, Washington DC and Boston from 25 to 28 April 2005. The visit helped to raise the profile of Irish companies by assisting them to enhance their relationships with US customers and partners. During my visit I met over 50 Enterprise Ireland client companies and participated in one to one meetings or announcements with 19 of them. I also met senior executives from US companies, including HSBC, World Bank, EMC, IBM and Pfizer.</P>
        <P>The key objectives of the visit were to support and highlight the successes of Irish companies and announce specific sales-partner deals; confirm to US buyers Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s role as a gateway to Irish industry and to build on relationships Enterprise Ireland has developed with both the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
        <P>During the visit I witnessed Irish companies announce deals and partnerships worth &euro;15 million with the potential to rise to &euro;90 million, with major American companies in the pharmaceutical, health care and financial services markets. Examples of this are Qumas which signed a $1 million deal with Janssen Pharmaceutica; Data Display which signed a $5 million deal with Siemens to supply its technology to the New York city subway system; Rockall Technologies which signed a $1 million dollar deal with Wachovia Bank; and Cylon Controls which announced a flagship deal in Washington to equip a 400,000 sq. ft. building with its energy and equipment control technology. There were several other deals discussed during the visit with clients such as Alimentary Health, Intuition, Anam and a number of others that cannot be made public due to commercial sensitivities.</P>
        <P>In addition to helping client companies secure sales and key reference sites for Irish companies in the USA, Enterprise Ireland is involved in several strategic initiatives including projects focused on building research partnerships with key institutes, networking activities, improving competitiveness through specialist consultants, expanding market reach through indirect channels and targeted campaigns with key global companies.</P>
        <P>During the visit I had the opportunity of meeting the US Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt; Elias Zerhouni, Director of the National Institutes of Health; Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez; Thomas J. Donohue, President of the US Chamber of Commerce; and Thomas Finneran of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council.</P>
        <P>I also attended a number of networking functions hosted by Enterprise Ireland and Irish diplomatic missions in the US with key people from both industry and academia in New York, Washington DC and Boston. In Washington DC I met the National Institutes of Health, NIH. The National Institutes of Health constitute the world&rsquo;s largest research facility with an annual <Col N="607" />budget of over $28 billion. Enterprise Ireland has in recent years developed a strong and very valued relationship with the NIH and has secured the assignment of an Enterprise Ireland representative at its office of technology transfer. The meeting allowed me to build on this key relationship with the NIH. I thanked Dr. Zerhouni, director of the NIH and the NIH for their efforts over the past three years in facilitating introductions between NIH institutes and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client base and I also thanked him for the launch of the NIH-Enterprise Ireland assignment, highlighting how valuable it will be and already is to the Irish life sciences industry. The meeting with Dr. Zerhouni of the NIH has led the way for discussions on extending the initial term of the NIH-EI assignment to the office of technology transfer there.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is actively following up on action plans to build on the opportunities for Irish companies and the excellent contacts established during this trip.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I understand that the liquidator has made considerable progress in realising the assets of the company and establishing the full extent of its liabilities and that he hopes to complete the liquidation process later this year. At this stage, the production sites at Arklow and Cork remain the principal assets yet to be realised. It is understood that contracts have been signed for the sale of both sites and that it is hoped that the sales will be closed over the coming months. It is a matter solely for the liquidator to determine whether to accept any particular offer made.</P>
        <P>The State has made a significant financial contribution to assist the former employees of Irish Fertiliser Industries. Following the decision by the board of IFI to put the company into liquidation, ICI and the State, the shareholders in IFI, while there was no legal obligation to do so, established a special fund with almost &euro;24.5 million to provide<i> ex-gratia</i> severance payments to the former employees of IFI. Payments from the fund were made were in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the trustee of the fund, which has been endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.</P>
        <Col N="608" />
        <P>In addition, the liquidator has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements in respect of the voluntary severance terms traditionally paid by the company. However, the dividend payable to the workers concerned, if any, can only be determined when all the assets of the company have been realised and all liabilities established. It must be emphasised, of course, that the amount, if anything, to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for determination by the liquidator.</P>
        <P>As regards pensions, I understand that the two main schemes covering employees in the Republic have sufficient funds to meet all of the entitlements provided under the schemes. While I understand that the schemes may not be in a position to provide some additional discretionary benefits that members had hoped to receive, it would appear that the payment of such benefits would always have been conditional on sufficient funding being available to meet the costs involved.</P>
        <P>I am aware that employees based in Belfast, who are deferred pensioners of the Richardsons pension fund, are likely to receive much reduced pension entitlements. The specific financial position of the Richardsons fund appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which currently apply on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees&rsquo; investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.</P>
        <P>I understand that the liquidator has accepted, in principle, that a claim on the liquidation, submitted by the trustees of the Richardsons scheme, is admissible. However, the amount of claim has yet to be established while the amount that might be recovered from the liquidation in due course will depend on the dividend rate for unsecured creditors generally. In addition, I understand that the UK Government has announced proposals to deal with the issue of pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardsons scheme. Depending on the outcome of these developments, there is the prospect of some alleviation in the position faced by the active members of the Richardsons scheme.</P>
        <P>While I have the utmost sympathy for the plight of the members affected by the shortfall that has arisen in the scheme, I am satisfied that the Government does not have any obligations in respect of the shortfall that the pension scheme faces.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The future development of Irish industry through innovation and internationalisation is a priority for me as Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. The enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report, Ahead of the Curve &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s Place in the Global Economy, provides a blueprint for the actions that need to be taken to secure and build on Ireland&rsquo;s position as a developed economy. Following Government consideration of the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group, I published an enterprise strategy group action plan. As part of that plan, I asked Enterprise Ireland to rethink creatively how to help business deliver on the core ESG recommendations.</P>
        <P>In particular, I asked Enterprise Ireland to focus on how best to accelerate the development and internationalisation of Irish-owned business as a priority for future economic development. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, Transforming Irish Industry, which I launched on 4 May 2005, outlines the agency&rsquo;s response to the enterprise strategy group action plan. It clearly represents a major change in approach. The strategy will, I believe, make a substantial contribution to the further internationalisation of Irish companies in an increasingly knowledge driven global economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland is at a turning point in its economic development. Irish companies must increasingly compete through innovation, superior market knowledge and a relentless focus on productivity gains and increased automation. We will need to see substantially increased levels of applied research in Irish firms and must foster an environment where there exists a close working relationship between companies and third level colleges. To be successful, companies need to be outward looking in their development strategies. Enterprise Ireland will partner with business to harness the undoubted development opportunities, which global markets offer. This, I believe, is where Enterprise Ireland can add real value.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has now undertaken a complete re-engineering of its overseas network and marketing supports, both in terms of business process and organisation structure, with a clear focus on client need. Specific deliverables have been set out in its strategy in terms of export growth, &euro;3 billion in new export sales over three years, achieving substantially increased levels of applied research in Irish firms, doubling to 1,050 the number of Irish firms carrying out meaningful research and development, that is, greater than &euro;100,000 annually, and driving entrepreneurship to deliver greater numbers of new high growth companies with strong export potential and increased employment opportunities to every region of the country &mdash; 210 high potential start-ups by year end 2007.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the strategy is appropriate, necessary and achievable and will position Irish <Col N="610" />industry as a key driver of Irish economic growth, jobs and wealth creation in an increasingly competitive global environment. Mindful of the immediate competitive pressures facing Irish companies, I also recently announced the establishment of the Enterprise Ireland productivity improvement fund with a total budget of &euro;20 million until the end of 2006 to assist Irish industry in its ongoing drive for efficiency and economic competitiveness.</P>
        <P>In supporting Irish industry Enterprise Ireland does not exist in a vacuum and therefore partnership with other State bodies, with CEBs and with academic and research institutions will be vital to future success.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The report of the consumer strategy group was published on 18 May 2005. The Government has accepted the core recommendation contained in the report and has given its approval, in principle, to the establishment of a new national consumer agency. The establishment of the new agency will require primary legislation. My Department has already commenced the necessary legislative and organisational work to ensure that the NCA is established as soon as possible. I expect to be in a position to publish the legislation establishing the NCA towards the latter half of next year and that the agency itself will be up and running in 2007. In the interim, I have appointed a board to the agency to act in an interim capacity until the NCA is established on a statutory basis. The interim board will fully participate in the preparations for the statutory NCA and will help to ensure that once established, the new agency will hit the ground running.</P>
        <P>While the precise structure and remit of the new national consumer agency will be the subject of consultations and discussions, it is clear that the NCA will differ considerably from the existing office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. It is likely that the new NCA will have a board structure and be fully independent of my Department, not only in the operation of its statutory functions but more particularly in terms of responsibility for the management of its resources and budget. The NCA will build on the valuable enforcement work currently being carried out by the Director of Consumer Affairs but will have an expanded role and wider statutory functions in areas such as consumer advocacy, information and advice, research and education and awareness. I agree with the consumer strategy group <Col N="611" />that the NCA must have these additional functions if it is to be effective in advocating the consumer&rsquo;s case.</P>

        <P>The work permits section of my Department has issued 9,349 work permits from 1 January 2005 to 30 April 2005. This compares with 13,039 for the same period in 2004, and 13,909 for that period in 2003.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. I have recently announced a 50% increase in the numbers of labour inspectors and have directed that these additional officers focus particularly on the sectors where non-EEA employees are most numerous.</P>
        <P>In addition, where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wage  legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid &mdash; P60 and other sources are used. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting immigrant workers, I ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>

        <P>As the regulations regarding the use of various forms of transport are agreed centrally for the Civil Service as a whole by my colleague the Minister for Finance, I do not have scope to offer particular incentives to my officials to use bus or rail for official business purposes nor do I believe that it would be appropriate for me to do so.</P>
        <P>Generally, the travelling and subsistence regulations published by the Department of Finance highlight the importance of using public transport where possible and appropriate. Generally officers are authorised to use their own transport on official business where suitable public transport is not available, where public transport is available only at equal or greater expense or where the use of public transport would result in the loss of official time which it is necessary to avoid. The Deputy will understand that the use of private transport by the travelling officials of <Col N="613" />my Department will regularly be necessitated in one or more of these circumstances.</P>

        <P>The reasons were both legal and practical. Enforcement of price display orders are carried out by way of regular surveys involving test purchases and by infringement proceedings against those who violate the order. Whereas test purchases are a feasible methodology to measure compliance and to discover infringements in the case of petrol stations and public houses they are not practical or ethical in the case of the services of doctors and dentists. Infringement proceedings on the other hand would not be possible without authorised officers of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs having access to the medical and dental records of patients and this would not be in compliance with data protection or privacy laws. Given these problems, I could not see how a price display order for doctors and dentists could be effectively enforced and I consequently decided not to proceed with it.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s quarterly report on the euro area asserts that Ireland&rsquo;s export performance appears quite weak relative to the euro-area average for the 2000-03 period, once the effects of our high-tech sector are excluded. At first glance this appears a rather surprising statement but on closer analysis the basis for the Commission&rsquo;s assessment is very narrowly defined. For example, the Commission&rsquo;s analysis is restricted to euro-area goods export data and it does not include internationally <Col N="614" />traded services. It also excludes exports from one member state to another.</P>
        <P>The exclusion of both services and exports to other member states is bound to produce an analysis that does not comprehensively reflect the reality of Ireland&rsquo;s export and competitiveness performance. This is particularly important because our export performance is driven by high technology exports from companies that use our competitive economy as a bridgehead into many European markets, particularly in the high value added pharmaceutical and ICT sectors. These qualifications are important as the Commission itself acknowledges when it commented &ldquo;the recent export performance of Ireland is significantly weaker when only goods are considered&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s competitive success continues to be built on key strengths as having one of the most favourable taxation regimes in Europe, access to the EU&rsquo;s internal market, a well educated and skilled workforce and a history of consistently pursuing pro-business policies to secure a competitive environment that is highly attractive for indigenous and foreign investment. These policies have ensured that on the basis of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development data, Ireland&rsquo;s share of global and EU foreign direct investment has risen sharply in recent years. From just under 4% of the total in 2000, Ireland accounted for more than 8% of total inflows to the EU-15 in 2003. On a global basis, we won almost 5% of total world inflows. Hard nosed investment decisions are not made in favour of uncompetitive and lowly rated economies.</P>
        <P>We will continue to innovate successful enterprise policies that increasingly promote quality employment and investment opportunities in high technology products and the rapidly expanding high value international services sector of the economy.</P>

        <P>On 4 May 2005, the company in question notified my Department of its decision to make 485 of its 1,456 employees <Col N="615" />redundant. Unfortunately, cost saving measures, including short-time working for the majority of its employees, which were taken last September, have proved insufficient for the company&rsquo;s needs. The company has indicated that its current sales volume does not justify maintaining two manufacturing plants in Waterford and Dungarvan and has decided to close the Dungarvan plant.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has been working very closely with the company, particularly over the last number of months, regarding the company&rsquo;s strategy. In recent discussions, the company made it quite clear that there was a need to consolidate manufacturing operations into one plant. The agency will continue to work with the company in implementing its restructuring programme.</P>
        <P>On 11 May last, I met the Waterford county manager to discuss the situation. An inter-agency forum, under the chairmanship of the county manager, has been established to deal with the job losses in the company. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and F&Aacute;S are participating in the forum together with all other relevant bodies, which have been brought into the process by the county manager. The first meeting of the forum took place on 13 May last and a second on 24 May. It is proposed that the forum will meet every two weeks for the present.</P>
        <P>The industrial development agencies will continue to promote Waterford, and the south east region generally, as an attractive location for the development of employment and investment opportunities. As well as attracting new knowledge-based industries to Waterford, there is a strong indigenous presence in the area. As regards Dungarvan in particular, the first phase of site development has been completed on IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial park and the first client, Biopin, has been secured.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The evolving structure of Irish enterprises, particularly the growth in internationally-traded services and the manufacture of higher technology based products means Irish exports are higher value-added in nature and as such are more resilient to exchange rate movements. Transforming our enterprise base will be accelerated by consolidating our competitiveness strengths, helping existing firms with tailored competitiveness enhancing programmes and attracting foreign investment in sophisticated niche products and services.</P>
        <P>Enterprise policy is being actively refocused towards creating the conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skill, knowledge-intensive activities and in which advanced manufacturing expertise will be an important contributor to growth and employment. This is essential if our enterprises are to sustain competi<Col N="617" />tiveness against adverse currency movements in exchange markets over which we have no influence. The range of incentives provided through the enterprise development agencies are designed to meet these objectives and to help enterprise operate at higher levels of skill, undertake higher order strategic investments, product development and innovation. The agencies want to be active and supportive partners with enterprise to help buttress their competitive strengths while building their capacity to expand into new products and markets where demand will be influenced more by product ingenuity and customer satisfaction than by simple cost-price considerations.</P>
        <P>Global foreign exchange markets determine the external value of the euro. It is not within the capacity of a small open economy to artificially influence trends in exchange rates and nor should we try. Our focus should rightly concentrate on building a competitive economy and competitive and productive firms that will be able to consistently convert global business opportunities into expanding jobs and profits for Ireland. I would also point out that trade with the euro area accounts for about 35% of total external merchandise trade. A significant proportion of our trade is therefore not directly affected by the euro-dollar exchange rate.</P>
        <P>While we saw a consistent weakening of the US dollar during 2004, this trend seems to have been reversed since the beginning of the year as the dollar has strengthened by about 7.5% since January. However, I am concerned that currency volatility can have a negative impact on small companies and their ability to manage these fluctuations to their competitive advantage. Enterprise Ireland, in association with the Irish Exporters Association and National Irish Bank, organised a series of foreign exchange risk strategy workshops throughout the country entitled, Managing Your Foreign Exchange Risk &mdash; a strategy for the future. These ran from June to October 2004 and were designed to inform exporters about foreign exchange rate risk and the strategies that they can adopt to manage and reduce those risks. A number of additional workshops were organised in response to excess demand from companies.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including migrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to <Col N="618" />migrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure on behalf of the employer to maintain adequate records is an offence.</P>
        <P>In many instances, the wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the hotel and catering trade are governed by the employment regulation orders, which are enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department. Rates of pay in hotels in Dublin and Cork are not covered by such orders but are subject to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</P>
        <P>The number of inspections undertaken by the inspectorate in 2004 under the relevant employment regulation orders was 215. To date this year, 62 inspections have been carried out under these orders. In 2004, labour inspectors of my Department undertook 462 inspections under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. So far this year the inspectorate has undertaken 168 inspections under the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister recently announced that he is appointing additional labour inspectors who will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. The group will consist of a team leader and ten labour inspectors. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s capacity to ensure that workers in these sectors receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation.</P>
        <P>I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>

        <P>The Government considered and endorsed the report of the high level committee that was asked to look at the most appropriate implementation arrangements for the enterprise strategy group, ESG, recommendations. The Government broadly supports the policy directions recommended by the group as <Col N="619" />underlined by its intention to implement, either in full or with some modifications, most of the ESG recommendations. Details of the position in relation to these recommendations are set out in the action plan which I announced on 4 May and which can be downloaded from my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash;<i> www.entemp.ie/enterprise/support/<?oasys _jy?>esgactionplan.htm.</i></P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?>
        <P>As regards recommendations which it is specifically not intended to implement, we have decided not to implement the recommendation that existing regulators for networked sectors should be replaced by a new regulatory body covering all networked sectors. In looking at international experience, the Government remains to be convinced that regulatory amalgamation on the scale proposed would be an efficient model. For example, there is a danger that a single regulator could give rise to slower decision making and have less focus on smaller sectors compared with more dominant ones. This is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to consider further the potential for the disaggregation of State procurement contracts for telecommunication services and my colleagues, the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance, will deal with this matter.</P>
        <P>The ESG&rsquo;s report makes a valuable contribution to making sure we have the vision to develop the most suitable policies to cater for the new realities and challenges facing the economy. The ESG policy prescriptions are particularly relevant to my Department and the enterprise support agencies that report to me. As part of the process of making important policy adjustments on foot of the ESG policy prescriptions, I asked Enterprise Ireland to rethink how it could better support indigenous firms in managing the challenges of enterprise growth and globalisation. This process culminated in a new strategic direction for the agency that I launched at the beginning of the month.</P>

        <P>The adoption of the framework agreement by the WTO General Council in Geneva, in July 2004, effectively relaunched the stalled Doha <Col N="620" />development agenda negotiations. The framework agreement sets clear and precise parameters on each of the key areas under the Doha development agenda, DDA, negotiations, including in the areas of agriculture, non-agricultural market access, NAMA, services, trade facilitation, and on development issues.</P>
        <P>It is now a matter for WTO members to develop the agreed framework into concrete, detailed and specific commitments including, for example, levels of tariff reduction, increased quotas, potential dates for elimination of agricultural export subsidies, and the further reduction, and-or elimination, of non-tariff trade barriers. Detailed negotiations on these aspects are now taking place among WTO members. It is important that the current momentum is maintained in these negotiations and that WTO members in Geneva move quickly towards the preparation of modalities on all key areas of the DDA in the lead-in to the next WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005.</P>
        <P>Ireland is engaged extensively in the preparation of, and input to, EU submissions to the WTO across the full spectrum of issues under the Doha agenda. Along with other EU member states, we will be anxious to secure a large measure of success in progressing the DDA negotiations at the next WTO Trade ministerial conference in Hong Kong.</P>

        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Sustaining Progress, a review of the Employment Agency Act 1971 is being carried out by my Department. As part of this review, my Department published in May 2004 a discussion paper on the 1971 Act and requested submissions from the various interests in the sector, including the social partners. A total of nine submissions were received and were examined in detail by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising a policy paper and is also consulting with the Office of the Attorney General on some of the details. The policy paper will be circulated to the various interests for further comment in the coming weeks.

        <P>As part of this review, I am currently considering that, in future: employment agencies will be required to be registered with my Department rather than be licensed as at present. Overseas agencies supplying workers to work in Ireland will also be required to be registered with the Department; employment agencies will be required to comply with the terms of a statutory code of practice which will set out in detail, the practices and standards which agencies would be expected to follow. This code will in particular, set out the employment rights of agency workers; a statutory monitoring and advisory committee &mdash; representative of all the various interests in the sector &mdash; will be established. This committee will oversee the operation of the statutory code of practice and make recommendations to me as the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs in relation to revoking or suspending registration and-or the prosecution of agencies who breach the code; any employer who recruits a worker from an unregistered agency either from Ireland or overseas will be guilty of an offence and liable to prosecution.</P>

        <P>As trade is a European Community competence, it is the European Commission which conducts the negotiations on the EPAs between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP states on behalf of the member states. The Commission provides the Council with regular updates on the progress of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations process and will continue to do so. In so far as the discussions within the EU Council, including the Article 133 Committee, are concerned, Ireland will insist that the Commission discharges its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou agreement and in a manner which is sensitive to the particular concerns of ACP states.</P>
        <P>As regards the UK paper on this matter, I agree with the basic thrust of an approach to the EPA negotiations which ensures that the needs and concerns of developing countries are taken adequately into consideration during the substantive phase of these negotiations. In this regard, in the context of the further progression of EPA negotiations, Commissioner Mandelson has indicated that he is putting the EPA process under continuing review, with a new review mechanism to ensure that at every stage in the negotiations that the development dimension is put first. I fully support this approach by the Commissioner.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I am aware of the decision by the company in question to close its plant in Bray, County Wicklow. I understand that the reason for the closure is that the company believes that the Bray plant is no longer viable due to changed customer demands, rising costs, increased competition and trading losses which could no longer be sustained. Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for the industrial development agencies. Already, F&Aacute;S has con<Col N="623" />tacted the company and outlined the full range of support services, including skills analysis and training that it can provide to the staff.</P>
        <P>The development agencies continue to market and promote Bray and the surrounding area for employment creation and investment. IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing base of companies with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and the agency also targets potential new investment projects. Nabi, a new greenfield Biopharma project from the United States, was officially opened on 26 April 2005 at the IDA business park in Bray and is expected to employ in the region of 30 to 40 people by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its client companies in Bray in order to assist them to become more competitive in order to increase export sales, resulting in further job creation in the area. Between 2002 and 2004, 35 EI client companies based in Bray were approved &euro;2.8 million in financial support from the agency to help these firms to grow sales, exports and employment and also to fund their plans for innovation and new product development. There are a number of Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the Bray region that are actively growing their businesses.</P>
        <P>The State development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, will continue to promote the Bray area for enterprise development and investment. According to the most recent Central Statistics Office live register analysis figures, there were 1,855 people on the live register in Bray in April 2005 down from 1,927 in April 2004, a decrease of 72. For County Wicklow, the corresponding figures were 4,432 people in April 2005, down from 4,540 in April 2004, a decrease of 108. While the live register is not designed to measure unemployment, I am encouraged by these figures as they reflect a falling trend in our standardised unemployment rate, which fell to 4.2% in April 2005.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>On 4 October 2004, the company in question announced that it intended to close its three existing manufacturing plants, one north of the Border and two south of the Border, and concentrate all of its manufacturing in one new plant. None of the three existing sites were deemed to be large enough, nor did any of them have access to sufficient water to accommodate <Col N="624" />the project. The company expected to announce its decision on the new location by the end of March 2005.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland worked very closely with the company to secure the new project but the company decided that the best location for the operation was in west Lisburn in Northern Ireland. The company has made it clear that the most important factor in the decision was the water issue. During the course of the negotiations on the project, I met Enterprise Ireland and union and worker representatives on 9 February 2005 to review progress at that stage.</P>
        <P>On 4 May 2005, the industrial development agencies met a local group from Greenore which has been affected by the company&rsquo;s decision. The workers were keen to facilitate the development of alternative industry on the site. Development options are to be pursued with the company and, when the scale of commitment which might be forthcoming from the company going forward has been ascertained, the position will be reviewed to establish the next course of action.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the supports and incentives offered by the Irish development agencies to companies are competitive and attractive compared with international comparisons. However, it is important to note that when considering whether or not to establish a new business in Ireland there are many factors which companies evaluate and it is the complete package that ultimately impacts on these decisions. Ireland as a member of the European Union is also bound by the EU regulations governing state aid in the form of financial supports to companies both Irish and foreign which decide to set up operations in Ireland. These regulations are designed to ensure competition exists between member states and balanced regional development is achieved.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to be an attractive location for enterprise, both Irish and foreign owned for a variety of reasons including: a highly skilled, English speaking workforce; a commitment to a low rate of corporation tax; investment in education; the flexibility, agility and creativity of the Irish labour force; our position within the EU single market; and the country is already home to a number of the world&rsquo;s leading ICT, pharmaceutical, medical devices and financial services companies and offers strong business networking-interaction opportunities.</P>

        <P>F&Aacute;S, in conjunction with the social partners, continues to maintain and develop procedures and mechanisms which are designed to keep under ongoing review the relevance of its training courses to the needs of business and those seeking employment. There are several ways in which F&Aacute;S maintains contact with and is responsive to the training requirements of business, job-seekers and the wider economy.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S, through its network of 70 offices and training centres in eight regions throughout Ireland, is in continual contact with local Irish business. In each region there is a dedicated services to business function with a manager and a team of experienced industry-training advisers, specifically employed to capture and respond to businesses&rsquo; training needs at a local level. In addition, F&Aacute;S has established a central head office unit which works closely with industry at sectoral level and regularly facilitates studies to ascertain current and future training needs and trends.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S also reviews, on a regular basis, the relevance of its training programmes in meeting the needs of those seeking employment. These needs are identified primarily through the regular contact between F&Aacute;S employment services and the unemployed and other jobseekers. A particular emphasis is placed on tailoring programmes to meet the needs of those who are long-term unemployed and those who are at risk of drifting into long-term unemployment. Apart from identifying demand for existing F&Aacute;S provision, F&Aacute;S has recently introduced a facility for recording training needs requested or identified by clients and which are not currently provided by F&Aacute;S, with a view to better informing its mix of programmes. On a higher level, the board of F&Aacute;S comprises of senior representatives of employer organisations, trade unions and others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>I am aware that Mr. David Begg, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, recently spoke on the subject of an overhaul of the system of industrial relations and employment rights. The evolution of employment rights legislation over a long period of time has led to the current system involving seven bodies and 25 Acts, which can be complex, with dupli<Col N="626" />cation of functions as well as divergences in procedures and remedies.</P>
        <P>The Government has recognised these deficiencies and included a commitment in the programme for Government 2002-07 to establish a review group on the functions of the employment rights bodies. This was the first ever review of the role and relationships of the employment rights bodies and their adjudication and enforcement frameworks.</P>
        <P>On 24 May I announced that the Government had agreed to a programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group and my subsequent consultations with the various interested parties. I am confident that the programme of action will improve considerably the levels of customer service that the various employment rights bodies can offer to those using the dispute resolution services. It will also facilitate the simplification and modernisation of procedures, providing greater transparency and ease of access.</P>
        <P>Our system of industrial relations is principally voluntary in nature. However, for situations where it is not the practice of an employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and where the internal procedures normally used by the parties have failed to resolve a dispute, the parties may avail of procedures set out in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and supported by the enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. These amended procedures, which were agreed with the social partners in the Sustaining Progress agreement, contain two distinct strands for settling the issues in dispute, a voluntary procedure and a fall-back legislative procedure.</P>
        <P>The consolidation of the large corpus of employment rights legislation, when coupled with the legislative proposals emerging from the work of the employment rights group which is to be established, will enhance the coherence and user-friendliness of the employment rights and industrial relations machinery and will be of benefit to all.</P>

        <P>Primary responsibility for policy in relation to the gender pay gap is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multi-faceted task <Col N="627" />involving a number of Departments. My Department undertakes the following actions.</P>
        <P>The national framework committee on work-life balance policies, which is chaired by my Department, undertakes a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work-life balance at the level of the enterprise. These include the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, and research activities.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the national minimum wage has also had an impact in addressing the gender pay gap. I recently accepted the Labour Court recommendation and increased the minimum wage to &euro;7.65 per hour with effect from 1 May 2005.</P>
        <P>Expanding the Workforce, which is run by F&Aacute;S, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work.

        <Quest>the number of deaths and injuries reported arising from industrial accidents in each year from 2000 to 2004 and to date; the further steps he intends to take to reduce the level of such accidents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>The rate of deaths and injuries in Irish workplaces is unacceptable. Since the beginning of 2000 to 25 May 2005, 338 people lost their lives in workplace accidents. Approximately 47,000 people also had workplace accidents resulting in occupational injury benefit claims for the years 2000 to 2003, inclusive.</P>
        <P>Overall trends in workplace accidents are best described by reference to the data from the occupational injury benefit claims published by Department of Social and Family Affairs, as the criteria for this benefit has remained the same over the years. Figures for 2004 and for 2005 to date are not yet available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, the Health and Safety Authority also uses other sources like the quarterly national household survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office and direct reporting to the authority itself to estimate the total injuries figure. For example, the estimate of injuries for 2003 as calculated by the authority is 20,900.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, the sectors of construction and agriculture account for double digit numbers and this is a cause for real concern in view of the resources which have been devoted to prevention in these sectors. While any death or injury at work is a cause for extreme concern, the workplace fatality rate has fallen significantly since <Col N="628" />1998 when 70 people died in the workplace. The rate of injury has also fallen as indicated in the following tables. This reduction in deaths and injuries should be seen against the background of an increase in the workforce of almost a quarter of a million workers since 1998.</P>
        <P>Internationally, rapid increases in the workforce usually lead to an increase in the fatal and non-fatal injury rate due to the introduction of inexperienced workers into the workplace. Thankfully, Ireland has been able to avoid such an increase.</P>
        <P>For the future I hope that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, which I expect will be enacted by the Oireachtas shortly, will give a new emphasis to the drive for a safer workplace. The Bill contains powers to introduce on-the-spot fines, testing for intoxicants, heavier fines and generally gives greater powers of enforcement to inspectors of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

        <P>The consumer strategy group recommends that a consistent approach to casual trading be applied across all local authorities and that this be done by means of statutory guidelines. The Government in its decision on the report of the consumer strategy group decided to establish a high level interdepartmental committee to examine the recommendations and report back to Government within three months with a detailed implementation plan.</P>
        <P>This recommendation will be considered by the high level committee along with all the other recommendations. Without wishing to pre-empt the conclusions of the high level committee the logical way to implement this recommendation is to amend the Casual Trading Act 1995 to provide that I, as Minister, could issue statutory guidelines as how casual trading should be regulated in a consistent way throughout the country. Such guidelines would cover issues such as types of licences, criteria for setting of fees, appropriate pitch sizes, etc. In this context, I will consult local authorities and traders within the coming weeks on a set of voluntary guidelines. If these are accepted, they will go a long way towards standardising and making fair the operation of casual trading laws throughout the country.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The principal means of delivering direct assistance to indigenous manufacturing companies is through the national enterprise development agency, Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland can assist those indigenous manufacturing companies that are, or at least have the potential to be, export focused. The decision to provide support to a client company is a day-to-day administrative matter for the agency concerned, and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>In May 2005, I launched Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy 2005-07 entitled, Transforming Irish Industry. This strategy is focused on implementing the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group, ESG, action plan to accelerate the development and internationalisation of Irish owned business in the manufacturing sector and internationally traded services sector, which I published following Government consideration of the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is acutely aware of the significant challenges and opportunities that have emerged as a result of globalisation and increased global competition. Ireland is at a turning point in its economic development. The reality is that the low cost model is no longer an option for Ireland. Irish companies must increasingly compete though innovation, adopting best practice, a relentless focus on driving productivity gains and increased automation. In addition, to be successful, companies need to be outward looking in their development strategies and should consider Enterprise Ireland as their development partner in harnessing opportunities that global markets offer.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland offers a set of sophisticated solutions tailored to the needs of its individual client companies throughout all regions. Each company is assigned a development adviser who works with the company across all business functions through the business development model, BDM, process. The BDM ensures that support is applied to critical business functions, namely, strategy, finance, research and development, marketing, human resources and production. Financial and non-financial support is provided to companies with a business strategy that encompasses all elements required for business success. Enterprise Ireland also provides expertise to companies in the indigenous manufacturing sector who wish to expand through increased export activity. Through its network of 33 international offices, Enterprise Ireland assists companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>
        <Col N="631" />
        <P>Research and innovation, both product and process development, are critical to success in the increasingly global marketplace. Enterprise Ireland encourages sustained levels of research and development activity through its RTI scheme and research and development initiatives. Research and development awareness campaigns are also run to demonstrate the benefits of such investment. Enterprise Ireland also fosters research collaboration between companies and colleges through instruments such as the innovation partnership initiative.</P>
        <P>To assist the drive towards competitiveness and productivity within manufacturing, Enterprise Ireland promotes the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s specialist technologist team delivers mentoring and developmental supports to individual manufacturing companies.</P>
        <P>In May 2005, I also launched a new productivity improvement fund. The productivity improvement fund managed by Enterprise Ireland will make available &euro;20 million over the next three years to support eligible SME client projects on a competitive tendering basis. It will enable companies adopt advanced technology and focus on skill developments to improve their competitive position by increasing the companies&rsquo; gross output, value added and exports while providing new employment or securing existing employment. More than 300 Irish companies are expected to avail of support under this initiative <Col N="632" />in order to improve their productivity and remain competitive in the face of global pressures.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>The following details relate solely to merchandise trade. The details with regard to imports are classified according to country of consignment as distinct from country of origin.</P>
        <P>Tables 1 and 2 give imports and exports respectively of the top 12 countries in terms of value of trade for each of the last five years; 1999 is included also for reference purposes.</P>
        <P>Tables 3 and 4 give similar details where the ranking is done on the basis of year-on-year increases in the value of trade for each country.</P>
        <P>In the context of these tables the lower the value of &ldquo;Rank&rdquo; the more significant the actual trade value or the year-on-year increase as the case may be. </P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
        <P>The following is the text of the relevant agreement with the ICTU in relation to the development of airport capacity:</P>
        <P LI="1"> Both the Government and the trade unions are committed to the ongoing development of the transport infrastructure together with the promotion of a high standard of quality secure employment in the industry. Accordingly, the Government and the ICTU are agreed, in the context of any development of airport capacity, and recognising the voluntarist nature of industrial relations, to support the objective of the maintenance of pay and terms and conditions of employment in line with the collective agreement then in place in the industry and to reflect the Government&rsquo;s support for the right to trade union membership for the purpose of collective bargaining in accordance with the principles of Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I should make clear that this agreement of June last was between the Government and the ICTU. Although negotiated at the same time, it does not form part of the mid-term review of SustainingProgress, and was therefore not an issue that was for discussion with or endorsement by IBEC or any of the other social partners.</P>
        <P>The agreement was reached after talks with the unions from which it was clear that it was an essential matter for them and the broad constituency they represent, in order to allow them to finalise a deal on the second half of Sustaining Progress.</P>

        <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to charges raised on foot of the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations 1987, S I 116 of 1987. Where a person is maintained as an inpatient for a single period of more than one day, no account shall be taken of the final day. The effect of this is that the charge applies per day with no charge for the day of discharge or, effectively, the charge applies per night. However where a day case is concerned more that one person may &mdash; properly &mdash; use a day bed in the course of one day and each patient using the day care facilities in this way can be charged under these regulations. In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Charges may be waived if, in the <Col N="642" />opinion of the Health Service Executive, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

The significantly increased staffing levels over this period must be viewed in the context of the substantial service developments which have occurred, particularly in the areas of child protection and intellectual disability services. There have also been significant increases in staffing levels in acute hospitals arising from the national cancer strategy and the cardiovascular strategy.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
        <P>As regards bed capacity, the number of inpatient beds decreased from 17,665 in 1980 to 11,862 in 2000. Approximately 4,000 inpatient beds were removed from the system between 1984 and 1988. A further 2,000 were removed between 1991 and 1993. In 2001 my Department carried out a detailed study of acute hospital bed requirements up to 2011 and published Acute Hospitals Bed Capacity &mdash; a National Review in January 2002. The study examined current bed capacity and activity in acute hospitals and developed a framework for estimating future acute hospital capacity requirements. The study took account of current service pressures, projected increases in total population, the rise in the number of older people, increasing demand for services and potential changes in clinical practice. It also highlighted the need to expand hospital services for public patients.</P>
        <P>In the health strategy the Government committed itself to improve access for public patients. This is to be achieved through a series of measures, including the provision of additional public hospital inpatient beds and day places. Since the publication of the health strategy, funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds and day places in acute hospitals throughout the country. Of this figure, 720 are in place and the remainder will come on stream before the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>
          <?oasys _dc14-?>In 2004 the average number of inpatient beds and day places available in public acute hospitals was 13,409 &mdash; source: Department of Health and Children &mdash; Integrated Management Returns 2004.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>

        <P>I offer again my sincere condolences to the families, relatives and friends of the deceased and wish the injured continued recovery. I acknowledge the major role of health service personnel in responding to this terrible accident and the part played by the fire service, the Garda, the Air Corps, which provided helicopter assistance, and the voluntary personnel involved.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is finalising a service level agreement with the Department of Defence which will formalise arrangements for the future provision of an air ambulance service by the Air Corps. Officials from my Department recently met the Department of Defence to progress the agreement. The draft agreement was also circulated to the executive for comment. It is expected that the agreement will be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that a significant helicopter fleet replacement programme has been approved and is being put in place for the Air Corps. Each of the new helicopters will have a specific air ambulance capability and the new fleet will have a far greater flying capacity which will augment the current service.</P>

        <P>MRSA, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is a resistant form of staphylococcus aureus. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, formerly known as the National Disease Surveillance Centre, collects data on MRSA bacteraemia, also known as bloodstream infection or &ldquo;blood poisoning&rdquo;, as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, EARSS. At national level, MRSA bacteraemia has been included since 1 January 2004 in the revised list of notifiable diseases under the infectious diseases regulations. The reporting process for MRSA bacteraemia remains the same for now, that is, direct reporting to the HPSC via the EARSS protocol which is done on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P>The number of cases of MRSA bacteraemia reported to the HPSC over the period 2000 to 2004 is as follows:</P>

        </table>
        <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
        <P FLI="0">Provisional figures for 2004 indicate that 553 cases of MRSA bacteraemia were notified last year. However, it should be borne in mind that the number of laboratories notifying cases increased in 2004 and thus a direct comparison between these years is probably not valid as it may reflect the increased number of participating laboratories. The HPSC regularly publishes this information on its website, <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>.</P>
        <Col N="649" />
        <P>International experience shows that the number of MRSA bloodstream infections seen in an individual hospital is generally proportional to the size of the hospital and the complexity of illnesses seen at that hospital. Thus larger hospitals treating sicker patients are more likely to see cases of MRSA bloodstream infection, compared to smaller hospitals. As can be seen from the overall number of cases reported, hospitals reporting cases of MRSA bloodstream infection will report more than one case in each quarter and this is in keeping with surveillance data from other countries.</P>
        <P>To address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including MRSA, the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, was launched in June 2001. Since then, approximately &euro;20.5 million in funding has been made available by my Department under the strategy; of which approximately &euro;4.5 million has been allocated in the current year. This SARI funding is in addition to normal hospital funding arrangements on infection control.</P>
        <P>In 1995 a Department of Health committee comprising representatives from my Department, consultant microbiologists, specialists in public health medicine, general practice and a representative from the Association of Infection Control Nurses produced a set of guidelines for the management of MRSA in acute hospital wards, including specialist units. The implementation and operation of these guidelines in acute hospitals is a matter for the hospitals in question in the first instance. The guidelines have been widely circulated and include an information leaflet for patients.</P>
        <P>The infection control sub-committee of the national SARI committee recently prepared draft guidelines on the control of MRSA in hospitals and community health care settings. The key recommendations cover such areas as environmental cleanliness, bed occupancy levels, isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use and protocols for the screening and detection of MRSA. These draft guidelines, based on the best evidence available internationally, are a key component in the response to MRSA. The recommendations, when signed off by the national hospitals office of the HSE, will replace the guidelines issued in 1995 on MRSA.</P>
        <P>Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of hospital acquired infections, HAIs, including drug resistant organisms such as MRSA. The HSE and hospital managers have corporate responsibility for infection control. Infection control, including hand hygiene, is a key component in the control of MRSA. The SARI infection control sub-committee released national guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings during 2004. These have been widely circulated by the HPSC and are available on its website, <i>www.hspc.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The ten point plan for accident and emergency departments which I announced in November 2004 includes provision for dedicated cleaning services and recognises the importance of <Col N="650" />hospital cleanliness. The national hospitals office of the HSE has identified the auditing and targeting of infection control initiatives and the enhancement of cleanliness of hospitals as priorities in its service plan for 2005.</P>

        <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply dated 5 May 2005, my predecessor, Deputy Martin, met the Survivors of Symphysiotomy, SOS, group in late 2003 and agreed that a range of measures would be put in place to support the group. In respect of the particular matters raised by the Deputy, my Department is advised by the Health Service Executive, HSE, that the current position is that it is finalising arrangements to issue replacement medical cards which will contain a special patient identifier which will allow for the fast-tracking of patients requiring hospital appointments and treatments, together with the provision of certain non-GMS items recommended for patients by their GP or consultant. In addition, independent clinical advice is available, on request, through the designated liaison personnel in each region to patients who have undergone symphysiotomy. This has already been availed of by a number of members of SOS and appropriate follow-up has been arranged. Moreover, the HSE has advised that applications for home help and home modifications will be dealt with on an individual basis in each HSE community care area. The liaison personnel can assist in the fast-tracking of such applications if necessary.</P>
        <P>Finally, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had been exploring the idea of engaging an expert from abroad to advise on the practice of symphysiotomy. It did not prove possible to source an expert who would be acceptable to the various interests.</P>

        <P>Following consideration of advice from the influenza pandemic expert group, I decided at the beginning of March that one million treatment packs of oseltamivir, Tamiflu, should be stockpiled. This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population and is in line with international trends. The Health Service Executive signed a contract with Roche Products (Ireland) Limited <Col N="654" />for the supply of Tamiflu on 8 April 2005. A total of 600,000 packs will be delivered by the end of this year. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered in 2006.</P>
        <P>The influenza pandemic expert group is reviewing and updating Ireland&rsquo;s 2002 influenza pandemic preparedness plan. This plan was based on the World Health Organisation, WHO, blueprint for an influenza pandemic plan published in 1999. The World Health Organisation published an updated global influenza preparedness plan in April 2005. Our plan is being revised in line with this revised WHO plan.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In terms of EU rates, the latest rates available from EuroHIV, the European centre for the epidemiological monitoring of AIDS and WHO and UNAIDS collaborating centre on AIDS, show that in Ireland in 2003 the rate for HIV infections was 100.9 per million population. EuroHIV does not produce an EU rate. Of those countries where a rate is reported, figures range from as low as 25.7 in the case of Finland to 228.4 in the case of Portugal. The UK rate is reported as 117.3.</P>
        <Col N="655" />
        <P>Surveillance data on reported HIV infections should be interpreted with caution because they do not represent HIV incidence. These data include many individuals infected in previous years and depend on uptake of HIV testing and patterns of reporting, both of which may vary between countries and over time. Furthermore, they are derived from different sources in different countries, may not be exhaustive in all countries and hence may not be comparable. In addition, a number of large countries &mdash; France, Spain and Italy &mdash; have not provided figures to EuroHIV. Accordingly, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to the comparative impact of HIV on different countries based on this data.</P>
        <P>The report of the national AIDS strategy committee, NASC, which was published in 2000, makes a range of recommendations for dealing with HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, STIs. The Department of Health and Children, through the national AIDS strategy committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care and management is working to implement these recommendations.</P>
        <P>More than &euro;6 million in additional funding has been provided to the Health Service Executive since 1997 to address the treatment of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. Seven consultants specialise in the treatment of HIV-AIDS and STIs in Ireland. Five of these are in Dublin, one of whom deals with children, one in Cork and one in Galway. HIV treatment is available free of charge to all who require it. The care and management sub-committee of the NASC has reviewed the development of HIV-AIDS and STI treatment services throughout the country and published a report with a number of recommendations in relation to these services.</P>
        <P>At the programme level, the Department is working with a wide range of partners to implement a comprehensive range of prevention programmes as recommended in the national health promotion strategy 2000-2005 and the report of the national AIDS strategy committee of 2000.</P>
        <P>In the school setting, the Department is working in partnership with the Department of Education and Science and the Health Service Executive to support schools in the introduction and delivery of social, personal and health education at both primary and post-primary level. Relationships and sexuality education is an integral part of this curriculum and remains a key priority for this work with schools.</P>
        <P>In the out-of-school setting, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children works in partnership with the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland to implement the national youth health programme. The aim of the programme is to provide a broadly based, flexible health promotion and education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those <Col N="656" />working with young workers, addressing the issues of relationships, sexuality and sexual health with young people.</P>
        <P>A national public awareness advertising campaign aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group has been developed to increase awareness about safe sex and sexually transmitted infections. The overall goal is to increase safe sex practices and reduce the incidence of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies among young people in Ireland. The campaign runs in third level colleges, places of entertainment, youth venues and some health centres. This national campaign has been running for several years and a new and revised campaign is being implemented by the health promotion unit which has greatly increased the number of venues targeted. The health promotion unit also produces a range of awareness raising leaflets on STIs and safe sex practices.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children will continue to monitor the position closely on HIV-AIDS.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by the HSE mid-western area that the community-based child and adolescent psychiatric service commenced in 1993 with the appointment of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and team. In the intervening years, based on national norms and the national working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, the service <Col N="657" />has been expanded to four multidisciplinary teams. The four teams, while operating on a regional basis, take specific responsibility for one of four identified geographical locations within the region, namely Clare, east and west Limerick and north Tipperary. In response to the increased throughput of referrals and service activity, clinics are now held in Limerick city and in the principal towns in the mid-west area. A liaison service is available to the regional maternity hospital. A paediatric psychiatric liaison service is available to paediatricians within the Mid-West Regional Hospital for children with a range of conditions, including cystic fibrosis, gastrointestinal conditions, diabetes, epilepsy and other related conditions.</P>
        <P>The number of referrals to the child and adolescent mental health service in the mid-west area has grown from 142 in 1994 to 867 in 2004. Of the 867 referrals in 2004, 745 were new referrals, with a total of 8,437 attendances.</P>
        <P>The philosophy and approach of this community-based service is to treat the young person with a mental health difficulty as close as possible to their own community and as far as possible in the context of their own family lives. The objective is to provide a multidisciplinary intervention where there is consistency and stability in the approach to the patient. Interventions are provided taking a holistic, multimodal approach to patient needs through the multidisciplinary team. Treatment interventions include assessment, diagnosis and treatment plans and risk assessment, including assessment of the risk of suicide. Therapeutic interventions, as far as possible, are provided in a way which maintain the young person in the home environment. The assessment includes identification of strengths within the family system and, if necessary, provision of appropriate support to the family. The young person&rsquo;s education or occupational capacity is also considered as part of the holistic treatment approach. The approach is designed to achieve maximum health outcomes in terms of health and social gain for individuals receiving services.</P>
        <P>The HSE in the mid-west plans to expand the service to provide five multidisciplinary consultant-led teams. The fifth team will be developed as the HSE mid-west regional child and adolescent in-patient unit becomes available. The 14-bed unit is at the planning stage and is a key development within the HSE mid-west&rsquo;s national development plan. While the acute in-patient child and adolescent facility is being developed, the service has access to two paediatric beds in the Mid-West Regional Hospital, Limerick. An informal arrangement exists with the adult mental health services in Limerick which allows adolescents requiring inpatient admission access to the adult acute psychiatric unit.</P>
        <P>In individual presentations in the over-14 age category, treatment options are discussed with the individual and their family to arrive at an agreed approach appropriate to the presentation. <Col N="658" />Options include the maintenance of regular contact with the CAMHS service; the activation of the out-of-hours service via the GP and accident and emergency unit if required outside of clinic hours; and the assessment and admission of the child to adult psychiatric or medical care or to the paediatric unit if the child is under 14 years via these routes. A consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist is on call, if required.</P>

        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is that a committee of inquiry to investigate the alleged misconduct of a consultant anaesthetist has been established with an estimated total cost of &euro;20,000. Although no costs have been incurred in 2005, it is expected that the &euro;20,000 will be paid this year. A second committee to inquire into the proposed removal of an officer of a health board has been established with an estimated cost for 2005 of &euro;5,000.</P>

        <P>Casemix is an internationally accepted management system for monitoring and <Col N="662" />evaluating health services which allows for the collection, categorisation and interpretation of hospital patient data related to the types of cases treated, in order to assist hospitals define their products, measure their productivity and assess quality. Casemix is used as part of the budgetary process in order to base funding on measured costs and activity rather than on less objective systems of resource allocation and to fund hospitals based on their mix of patients.</P>
        <P>The national Casemix programme compares the costs and activity of the 37 hospitals that participate in the programme. It operates a &lsquo;budget neutral&rsquo; policy which rewards efficiency by retargeting funds from less efficient hospitals to those who have demonstrated that additional funding will result in real benefits. The Casemix budget adjustments that were applied as part of the financial allocations for 2002-05 are set out in the following table. Many hospitals that lose funding under the programme review their management and go on to gain funding in following years.</P>
        <P>I am committed to rewarding good performance and as Casemix is the most internationally accepted &lsquo;performance related&rsquo; acute hospital activity programme, I am committed to the expansion of Casemix in order that it be used as a central pillar in acute hospital funding policy.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Health Service Executive has been piloting home care grant schemes in a number of areas. These schemes have been targeted at supporting older people living in the community as an alternative to long-term residential care and for older people who are being discharged from the acute hospital system. In the HSE eastern regional area, people have been discharged from acute hospitals under the sl&aacute;n abhaile and home first pilot projects. In the HSE southern area, a similar project, Curam, has been piloted, while the &lsquo;choice&rsquo; programme in the HSE north-west area also provides such a scheme.</P>
        <P>The development of a national home care grant scheme is in keeping with a key recommendation in the O&rsquo;Shea report on the nursing home subvention scheme which recommended that the health services develop a home based subvention scheme for older people as an alternative to long-term residential care. Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2005 to develop the scheme further. In addition, funding of &euro;113.75 million was allocated in 2004 for the home help service to support older people living in the community, with this funding being increased to &euro;118.75 million in 2005.</P>

The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 allows for the payment of a subvention towards the cost of such care based on a medical and means assessment. The process used in determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility for subvention is set out in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993.</P>

My Department has also requested the HSE to develop complementary initiatives in regard to management, work practices and processes in hospitals.</P>
        <P>To assist those hospitals who are experiencing continuing pressures on their emergency services, the National Hospitals Office has sought tenders from companies who are expert in the area of work flow management to carry out a review to determine what internal actions can be achieved to improve patient flows and reduce overcrowding.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
        <P>The closing date for the tenders was 27 May. I understand the National Hospitals Office intends that this work will commence over the summer months in regard to ten major hospitals separately. The results of the analysis will begin to be available from August and I expect that hospitals will immediately take the actions necessary to improve patients&rsquo; experience. The experience of the NHS in the United Kingdom is that this type of hospital-by-hospital improvement made a significant contribution to reduced patients&rsquo; waiting times in accident and emergency departments.</P>

        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Services Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for health service recruitment. Accordingly, my Department has requested the chief officer of the executive&rsquo;s south eastern area to investigate the matter raised and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
        <P>Demand for speech and language therapists was recognised in the Bacon report in 2002 when it was recommended that training places for speech and language therapists increase from 25 per year to 105 places per year. To address this shortfall in supply, three new schools of speech and language therapy were opened in 2003, in National University of Ireland in Galway and Cork and University of Limerick. In addition, the number of training places in Trinity College Dublin was enhanced.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the end of this academic year when the first graduates of these new courses will emerge, those students who undertook an accelerated two-year masters programme in University of Limerick, and to 2007 when we will see the graduates from the traditional degree programme from the universities in Cork and Galway.</P>
        <P>To meet the current demand for speech and language therapists, we rely heavily on the return of students who have studied abroad and also on an EU and non-EU workforce. It is estimated that 20% of the speech and language therapy workforce is foreign. In 2002 an additional grade of clinical specialist was introduced to speech and language therapy. This additional grade has many objectives including to ensure best practice and research in the profession. It is intended to review and develop this extremely beneficial grade in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists has embraced the Sustaining Progress agenda and has produced a position paper for the introduction of programme assistants to the profession. It is believed that this skill mix will ensure the best use of scarce and valuable resources. I look forward in the near future to the establishment of this grade and a training programme for such programme assistants.</P>
        <P>Despite the significant developments in speech and language therapy to date, it is widely accepted that there is further need to substantially enhance the numbers employed in the health and education sectors. Long waiting lists for services must become a feature of the past. The recently announced investment in the disability sector will be a significant step in moving forward to a service where those in need of this essential service, receive it.</P>
        <P>The national disability strategy provides a framework of positive action measures to support participation by people with disabilities in society. The strategy consists of four elements; the Disability Bill 2004; the Comhairle (Amendment) <Col N="671" />Bill 2004; six outline sectoral plans; and a commitment to a multiannual investment. The strategic review of services being undertaken by my Department is examining the significant service provision in place, focusing on specific issues of concern to people with disabilities and their families and carers, together with statutory and voluntary bodies in this area, with an opportunity to input into the planning and delivery of services over the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Government announced on budget day a special disability multiannual funding package with a total value of almost &euro;900 million for the years 2006 to 2009, which includes an allocation of &euro;300 million out of the revised capital envelope to these high priority disability services. The amounts allocated for 2005 are &euro;70.39 million and &euro;34 million in respect of revenue and capital funding respectively. To ensure the various elements of this additional funding are targeted to meet the priority needs which have been agreed, and in particular to meet the needs of those who are not in receipt of vital elements of service provision, a protocol has been developed by my Department with the Health Service Executive to facilitate the monitoring of the specific investment programme in disability services under national disability strategy. In this regard, the Health Service Executive has established a disability policy and legislation standing group, which has been working with my Department on the implementation of the strategy and the roll-out of the new disability legislation.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for speech and language therapy. Accordingly, my Department has requested the chief officer of the executive&rsquo;s south western area to <Col N="672" />investigate the matter raised in County Kildare and reply to the Deputy.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>A total of 22 monument sites are in the care of the Office of Public Works in County Roscommon, eight of which belong to a single complex of monuments. The following table outlines expenditure on conservation work at these sites from 2000 to 2004. Routine maintenance of the sites &mdash; cleaning, grass cutting etc. &mdash; is carried out by the staff from the national monuments depots in Athenry and Dromahair but it is not possible to give a breakdown for individual sites. Heritage sites managed by the Office of Public Works are not promoted individually. Such sites are promoted collectively, nationally and regionally, in conjunction with the regional tourism authorities, Shannon Development and, in the case of County Roscommon with Ireland West. National and regional versions of brochures are distributed at staffed OPW managed heritage sites and through the tourist information offices network operated by the regional tourist authorities. It is not possible, therefore, to separately quantify the expenditure on the marketing of heritage sites in County Roscommon.</P>

        <P>Vehicle registration is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised that the current index marks system, for example, D for Dublin, and corresponding placenames, for example, Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath, for vehicles that are registered in the State was introduced in 1987, based generally on the system of local authority licensing authorities. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that following representations on this matter, some time ago, in respect of one Dublin local authority, stakeholders, including the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport and the Garda, were contacted for their views on the matter. Having liaised with all parties, the Revenue Commissioners found that, when compared to the clarity and simplicity of the current D index mark for the entire Dublin region, a move to differentiated index marks for the various Dublin local authorities concerned did not find favour with stakeholders generally. Accordingly, there are no proposals at this time to change the regulations.</P>

        <P>Stamp duty exists on credit cards to provide Exchequer revenue. The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and, when electronic means of money transfers were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques, etc., was not eroded.</P>
        <P>The current annual rate of stamp duty on credit card accounts is &euro;40. This duty arises irrespective of the age of the person who holds the account. <Col N="674" />This charge is not excessive and there is no evidence that it significantly discourages people from using this form of transaction. It is also not clear that the stamp duty on credit cards discourages people from putting their money into banks, as credit cards offer the option of purchasing goods on credit but are not used principally as a means of withdrawing money on deposit. Stamp duty on credit cards is a significant contributor to the Exchequer and, in 2004, the stamp duty on credit cards contributed &euro;59 million to the Exchequer. There are no plans to introduce an exemption from stamp duty on such cards for any category of individual.</P>
        <P>The Government has done much to help those aged 65 and over. The income tax age exemption limits have been increased by about 150% since 1997 removing 75,500 elderly people from the tax net. In addition, the current rate of payment for old age pensions has increased by more than 80% over the rate payable in 1997. This is well ahead of the rate of inflation and represents a significant improvement in provision for our older citizens.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 to 197, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have direct responsibility for the management of the State property portfolio. One of their objectives is to ensure that the property portfolio is used in an optimum way from the point of view of the State and the taxpayer. With this in mind, the Commissioners of Public Works are pursuing a programme of extracting maximum value from the property assets. Part of this programme involves the granting of licences to telecommunications companies to install masts on a range of State owned properties in return for an agreed level of fees.</P>
        <P>Following negotiations with the telecommunications companies a standard licence agreement has been agreed. The licence agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which telecommunications companies will be allowed to install equipment on State owned properties. A mobile phone operator granted such a licence will be required to strictly comply with all relevant Health and Safety Acts, will operate within current standards and EU regulations and will adhere to the guidelines on exposure limits to emissions issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. Consultants appointed by the Commissioners of Public Works will be carrying out checks on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with these standards. Licensees will also be required to fully comply with normal planning regulations.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as taxpayers are not required to provide details of the benefit on the provision by employers of on-site child care facilities in their tax returns, there is no basis on which an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of this tax exemption, or of the numbers availing of it, can be provided. In the case of employers the expense of providing or subsidising child care facilities for employees is allowable as a deduction in arriving at profits for tax purposes. However, the employer&rsquo;s tax return of income does not contain an entry in respect of this item and the employer&rsquo;s profit and loss account does not normally distinguish between this particular expense and other employment-related expenses. In these circumstances, there is no basis on which a <Col N="677" />reliable estimate of numbers involved can be provided.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the sixth VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. The provision of child care facilities does not fall into this category and cannot, therefore, be zero rated. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of VAT collected from child care providers cannot be identified in the overall yield of VAT, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require this to be identified.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>Accelerated capital allowances of 100% are available for child care facilities under section 63 of the Finance Act 2000. Under the normal self-assessment rules, a person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. Claims for this relief are aggregated in tax returns with other claims, such as with industrial buildings allowances generally or with other capital allowances, and do not distinguish between the reliefs claimed in respect of child care facilities and those claimed in respect of other buildings qualifying for capital allowances. Consequently, it is not possible for Revenue to indicate the level of take-up of the specific incentive relating to child care facilities.</P>
        <P>However, as part of ongoing commitments to improve the quality of information available on the costs of tax expenditures generally, the Revenue Commissioners have introduced a number of changes to certain tax forms which will yield additional information regarding the cost of reliefs. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to underpin these changes. This will provide better data in this area and enable fuller estimates of the tax foregone to be made over time.</P>

        <P>I am not in favour of introducing double deductions for tax purposes for any area of the tax code. If double deductions were introduced for the specific types of expenditure suggested by the Deputy, this would inevitably give rise to demands for similar treatment for other areas which would give rise to a significant Exchequer cost. As regards the question of such double deductions in general, while a double rent deduction existed in the past under the 1985 and 1994 urban renewal schemes, it had to be abolished for the present urban renewal scheme because of EU state aid rules relating to operating aid.</P>

As part of ongoing commitments to improve the quality of information available on the costs of tax expenditures generally, the Revenue Commissioners are introducing a number of changes to certain tax forms which will yield additional information regarding the cost of reliefs. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to underpin these changes. This will provide better data in this area and enable fuller estimates of the tax foregone to be made over time.</P>

        <P>The relevant property referred to by the Deputy is set out in section 15 of the Valuation Act 2001 as being a building or part of a building, land or a waterway or a harbour directly occupied by the State, including any land or building occupied by any Department or office of State, the Defence Forces or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or used as a prison or place of detention.</P>
        <P>State-occupied property has traditionally been exempt from rates but central Government made a compensating payment to local authorities by way of a bounty in lieu of rates and the bounty was distributed to local authorities in proportion to the concentration of State-occupied property in their areas.  The Valuation Office valued the property for this purpose and the bounty was determined and administered by that office.</P>
        <P>This practice continued until 1987, when the bounty, which was then approximately &pound;13 million, was subsumed into the rates support grant and administered by the Department of the Environment.  Since that time, the compensation for foregone rates has lost all connection with the valuation system and the property details and<?oasys _jy?>valuations of State-occupied property have not been maintained by the Valuation Office.

        <P>Traders making supplies in the State are obliged to register for VAT where certain turnover thresholds are exceeded or are likely to be exceeded in any continuous period of 12 months. Under EU law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, member states may only increase thresholds in line with inflation. The current thresholds, which were enacted by the Finance Act 1994 with effect from 1 July 1994, are &euro;25,500 and &euro;51,000. The former is in the case of a person supplying services. This threshold also applies to persons supplying a combination of goods and services or goods <Col N="682" />chargeable at the 13.5% or 21% VAT rates which are produced from zero-rated materials. The latter is in the case of persons supplying goods. Businesses with turnover below these thresholds can register for VAT and those in the service sector particularly frequently choose to do so for business reasons. It is not customary for me to comment on any possible changes to thresholds that may or may not arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

        <P>The full year gain to the Exchequer from increasing the current standard rate of corporation tax from 12.5% to 17.5% is tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be in the region of &euro;730 million. This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such an increase. However, it should also be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax, CT, rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland, thereby increasing employment here. We also must consider Ireland&rsquo;s place in the new enlarged EU where CT rates are low in some new member states. Ireland must continue to remain competitive in this environment. For these reasons, there are no plans to increase our present low CT rate.</P>

        <P>The Government has not made any representations to the Chinese authorities regarding the revaluation of the yuan. As Minister for Finance, I do not comment on any particular exchange rate of the euro or other currency. However, I would endorse the statement made by Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg in his capacity as chairman of the EU ECOFIN Council to the spring 2005 meeting of the IMF international monetary and financial committee on 16 April in Washington:</P>
        <P LI="1">Excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. In particular, sharp moves of exchange rates are unwelcome and not conducive to orderly adjustments of external balances. All major countries and economic areas must play their part more actively in reducing global imbalances by putting in place the appropriate economic policies. A smooth and orderly appreciation of the exchange rate of some Asian emerging countries is needed.</P>

        <P>My Department spent &euro;448,911.73 on software licensing in 2002. Of this, &euro;239,124.76 was spent on software licences from the company referred to. The corresponding figures for 2004 are &euro;548,903.68 and &euro;318,076.91 respectively. My Department has been using open source software since 1995. In that regard, the Civil Service Internet access infrastructure, which my Department has managed since 1996, was operated almost exclusively using open source software for mail relays, web and caching servers, operating systems and firewalls. We also use open source software to develop web enabled applications both for use within my Department and for cross-departmental applications and we are considering the use of open source software for the management of my Department&rsquo;s network infrastructure.</P>
        <P>My Department, in line with Government policy and procurement law, operates a procurement policy that facilitates open competition, best value for money and best fit to requirements. Within that approach, different products are evaluated on their merits, including openness in terms of future procurement and, where possible, avoiding a lock-in to a particular supplier. Accordingly, an open view is taken that tends in practice to follow standards emerging from the market. These open standards are critically important to facilitate interconnection of computer systems and exchange of data and information across these systems. Consequently, with respect to the costs of software, my Department considers the total cost of ownership, which includes the costs of development and customisation, deployment, maintenance, support, upgrades, training and skills development in addition to the licensing element.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 249 together.</P>
        <P>The latest figures from EUROSTAT relate to 2004 and are now almost six months old. They show, however, that Ireland is placed 20th of 26 countries in respect of broadband connections for all enterprises. The figure in respect of large enterprises is 79%, placing Ireland in 16th place. EUROSTAT also reports that 92% of all Irish enterprises have access to the Internet, which is ninth in the table, while for large enterprises the figure for Internet access is 100%. The level of Internet access for households is 40%, or 11th place in the table, and 3% have a broadband connection. The number of broadband customers in Ireland is increasing rapidly and now stands in the region of 160,000. For comparison, the January 2004 figure was 35,000. The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by the private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government is acting on the broadband penetration figures in a number of areas. My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit in co-operation with the local and regional authorities by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide using European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and Government funding under the National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-2006. The MANs programme is being rolled out on a phased basis and the 19 networks completed to date have come in on time and within budget. Work is currently under way on seven MANs and construction of a further 82 will commence during the next 12 months. Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>For smaller towns and rural communities, my Department offers grant aid of up to 55% of set-up costs to enable local groups to become self-sufficient in broadband, using the most suitable technology for their area. Under the broadband for schools project, every one of the 4,200 primary and post-primary schools in the country will be provided with broadband by the end of this year. The provision of telecommunications, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. According to ComReg, there are more than 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including digital subscriber lines, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to any broadband consumer in Ireland right now. The Government&rsquo;s broadband target is to be within the top half of EU countries by the <Col N="687" />end of 2007. I have set the industry a target of 500,000 broadband customers by the end of 2006. That means a market penetration of around 14% of the overall population, which I feel is within reach when account is taken of all of the technology options available.</P>

        <P>The Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003, provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, would be responsible for drawing up the scheme through which the fund can be accessed. During the course of 2004, the BCI developed and published a draft scheme and consulted widely on it. However, before the scheme can become operational, two formal approvals are required. First, under section 2(1) of the 2003 Act, the BCI is required to submit a draft scheme to me for approval. The draft scheme was formally submitted for approval to the Department by the BCI in December 2004.</P>
        <P>Second, EU Regulations 659/1999 and 794/2004 require Ireland to formally notify the EU Commission of all aid schemes to ensure compatibility with EU State aid and competition rules. To this end, a copy of the draft scheme was sent to the Commission in mid-January in order to seek its initial views. Towards the end of March, the Commission indicated it did not see any major problems with the scheme. Accordingly, my Department formally notified the Commission on 28 April. Under the procedural regulations, the EU Commission has a period of two months to make a decision, although this period may be extended with the consent of the member state concerned. I await the outcome of the Commission&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>

        <P>The study is reported in a research paper published in the BMJ Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine on 17 May 2005 titled Use of Cellular telephones and brain tumour risk in urban and rural areas by L. Hardell, M. Carlberg and K. Hansson Mild. The paper aimed to investigate the association between the use of cellular or cordless telephones and the risk for brain tumours in urban and rural areas. It considered patients in Sweden aged 20-80 years and based the results on 1,429 cases with 1,470 controls and claims that users in rural areas were 1.4 to 3.2 times more at risk from digital cellular telephones while their counterparts in urban areas were less at risk by a factor of 0.9. It claims the effect was most obvious for malignant brain tumours. The paper concluded that, in future studies, place of residence should be considered in assessment of exposure to microwaves from cellular telephones, although it admitted that the results in the study must be interpreted with caution due to the low numbers in some of the calculations. The paper is being examined by my Department. When I have considered its contents, I will be happy to comment further on the matter.</P>

        <Col N="689" />
        <P>I understand the telephone exchanges serving the Palmerstown area have been enabled for the provision of DSL broadband and a number of service providers are marketing broadband in the area. The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market. Recent press announcements by some of the major service providers indicate a growing level of competition in the broadband market and a considerable increase in availability. While the principal broadband technology in use in Ireland is digital subscriber line, DSL, which is also the situation in most European countries, there are technical limitations to the service, such as line quality and distance from the exchange. Even though a line may be in an enabled exchange it may not be suitable for DSL broadband. If a telephone line cannot carry DSL, other technologies may need to be considered, such as wireless, cable modem or satellite. My Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, lists a number of service providers who offer broadband in the Palmerstown area, including nine DSL, one wireless and eleven satellite providers. The website also gives comparative details of prices and service levels and can be used to check if an individual telephone line can carry DSL broadband.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 to 237, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, which was established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements a wide variety of programmes on energy efficiency and renewable energy on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>Under SEI&rsquo;s house of tomorrow research, development and demonstration programme, financial support is directed at encouraging developers of housing, both new-build and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features that deliver significantly superior energy and CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> performance. By targeting developers of schemes of houses, from the private or social housing sectors, the aim is to establish, over several years, a nationwide network of accessible examples of more sustainable energy design and technology practices. Accompanied by other promotional measures by SEI, this is intended to encourage a sufficient degree of market replication, without subsidy, to elevate energy performance standards across the wider housing stock. This targeted approach is also designed to be an administratively efficient method for deployment of public moneys.</P>
        <P>To date the programme has committed more than &euro;7.5 million to 39 projects comprising a total of 1,818 housing units, all featuring an integrated approach to energy supply and use that achieves performance at least 20% better than current building regulations. In fact, in the majority of projects, the performance is 40% better.</P>
        <P>As stated, the programme has been directed at suppliers and developers of housing, rather than individual householders. There are two main reasons for this. First, house of tomorrow is a research and development support scheme, not a home improvement grants scheme. It seeks projects of sufficient scale and impact to influence wide application of the practices and technologies demonstrated. An effective way to achieve this is <Col N="691" />by means of clusters of homes, which will provide regionally visible and accessible examples that can be replicated. Overall, integrated developments are encouraged.</P>
        <P>Second, a key need in moving towards more energy efficient planning and construction practices in Irish homes is to develop the necessary awareness and capability within the construction industry. SEI, through its consumer awareness programmes, seeks to increase the demand for energy efficiency amongst homeowners and occupants. House of tomorrow, as a research, development and demonstration programme supports the development and demonstration of capability in the industry to deliver higher quality energy efficient homes to meet such a demand. The aim is to increase standards and practices across the industry as a whole.</P>
        <P>Regular reviews are conducted on all SEI&rsquo;s funding programmes. In this context, it may be possible to give consideration to developing a grant scheme, as part of this programme, which would make money available to individual householders in respect of specific sustainable energy features. Factors entering any such consideration include the establishment of consumer product standards, supplier capability and installation quality assurance systems appropriate to consumer markets. This is in addition to the core requirements of energy and CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> saving impact, market impact potential, administrative efficiency and ultimately, value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Funding for SEI is determined on an annual basis. SEI submits a proposed work programme for the coming year along with a budget for each of its programmes, such as the house of tomorrow programme, to my Department. Any increase in funding required for these programmes would have budgetary implications and could only be considered in the light of the overall budgetary requirements of SEI and the level of funding available to my Department.</P>

        <P>An Post has a remit to be financially viable and, following significant losses amounting to &euro;43 million in 2003 alone, An Post management <Col N="692" />invoked the &lsquo;inability to pay&rsquo; clause provided for in Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>The key challenge for the company is to return to long-term financial stability. In this regard, An Post unions and management are involved in intensive negotiations with the assistance of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in a bid to agree a recovery plan that will put the company on a sound footing. The question of Sustaining Progress related payments is being addressed in a process brokered by the labour relations commission. An agreement on a viable recovery plan will enable An Post to deliver quality services to citizens, while at the same time providing sustainable, well-paid employment for its staff.</P>

        <P>My Department recently received a request for funding from Louth County Council regarding the matter raised by the Deputy. However, my Department has no function regarding road-funding of any type.</P>
        <P>The provision of non-national roads in County Louth is a matter for Louth County Council, to be funded from its own resources and supplemented by grants provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, as the Deputy may be aware, the provision, improvement and maintenance &mdash; including the allocation of funding to individual projects &mdash; of national roads, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Transport.</P>

        <P>The Government and An Post share the objective of maintaining a viable nationwide post office network through a strategy of maximising the volume of both public and private sector business handled by the network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining a nationwide post office network. <Col N="695" />Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network will continue to take full account of these social benefits.</P>
        <P>The post office network has been the subject of a number of studies and reviews in recent years. Many of the recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented, with particular regard to winning new business &mdash; including extra banking and new utility business.</P>
        <P>Where vacancies for a postmaster or postmistress arise in the normal course of events, An Post advertises the position at least twice and actively canvasses for suitable persons to fill the vacant positions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants, that a post office is closed.</P>
        <P>There is widespread recognition that the best strategy to sustain the network is for An Post to continue adapting to its customer needs and maximising efforts to secure existing business, while pursuing new business at every available opportunity.</P>
        <P>On the matter of on-line connectivity of the entire network, the current automated network accounts for over 95% of An Post&rsquo;s counter business. This means that the 1,000 automated offices transact 95% of counter business while 475 non-automated offices undertake 5% of business. Nevertheless, An Post is now undertaking a pilot project, which will see ten manual post offices automated in order to gauge the effect on business. An Post is also engaging with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs regarding automation of ten island post offices. Furthermore, An Post will undertake a fundamental reappraisal of the post office network. The objective of this exercise is to build on the existing strengths in terms of nationwide network, strong brand recognition and high footfall and to devise a suite of products and services to meet current and future needs of post office customers. This strategy will provide the road map for future service delivery throughout the network.</P>

        <P>In May 2003, the high level review of the State commercial ports operating under the Harbours Acts, 1996 to 2000, was published. This was the first review undertaken since enactment of the Harbours Act, 1996. This legislation removed Ireland&rsquo;s key ports from direct departmental control and gave them the commercial freedom to operate as modern customer-service oriented service industries. The remit of <Col N="696" />the review was to critically examine the current model for the governance of the State commercial ports.</P>
        <P>On foot of the publication of the review, a comprehensive consultation process was initiated, which involved interested parties making both written and oral submissions relating to future ports policy. The responses received informed the content and recommendations of the Government&rsquo;s policy statement on ports.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, I launched the ports policy statement. It aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. The policy statement includes the following key elements: clearer and more focussed commercial mandates for the ports and their boards; encouragement of private sector investment and involvement; sanction for the use of non-core assets to fund new port development but not to mask inefficiencies; encouragement of healthy competitive conditions within and between ports; better consultation and dispute resolution between port companies and users through appropriate information sharing and arbitration mechanisms.</P>
        <P>In the section headed &ldquo;Port Company Boards&rdquo;, the policy statement indicates that the appointment of port users to the boards of the commercial State port companies can lead to conflicts of interest and, in line with the recommendation of the high level review, it is intended that this process will cease with regard to all future appointments.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, the functions of sea-fishing boat licensing and registration were transferred from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats, which operates on an independent basis, subject to criteria set out in that Act. All applications for sea-fishing boat licences are considered by the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats. The head of the licensing authority is the registrar general of fishing boats, a senior official in the Department.</P>
        <P>The licensing authority has informed me that the individual concerned applied for a sea-fishing <Col N="697" />boat licence under the terms of a special scheme introduced in the mid 1990s for the licensing and registration of small fishing boats. A licence was not granted in respect of the vessel due to safety defects. The applicant proposed licensing an alternative vessel under the scheme, under which replacement capacity was not required to be provided but because this boat is larger than the original, she was advised in February 2003 that the difference in capacity &mdash; in terms of tonnage and engine power &mdash; between the two boats would have to be provided by way of replacement capacity prior to licensing.</P>
        <P>The remainder of the capacity required to be provided could be transferred from the other boat referred to by the Deputy, which has already been removed from the fishing boat register. However, it should be noted that under licensing policy, this off-register capacity must be brought back on to the register before the end of this year; otherwise the entitlement to use it would be lost. To transfer the capacity to the applicant&rsquo;s replacement vessel, it is necessary that a capacity assignment form be completed by the relevant parties and forwarded to the licensing authority.</P>
        <P>The licensing authority will issue a non-operative licence in respect of the applicant&rsquo;s vessel, subject to compliance with any other conditions of current licensing policy, such as the provision of a declaration of compliance with a code of practice relating to safety of the vessel. The non-operative licence would allow the vessel owner to have the boat registered, following which the licensing authority can issue an operative sea-fishing boat licence. Subsequently, it would be open to the vessel owner to apply to the licensing authority at any stage to have her boat removed from the register.</P>

        <P>The two cases to which the correspondence to which the Deputy referred are entirely different in nature, the consideration of which involved totally different criteria and circumstances in the context of sea-fishing boat licensing.</P>
        <P>The individual to whom the Deputy specifically refers applied for a licence in respect of a vessel under a special whitefish scheme in 1991. All applications received under the scheme were evaluated in accordance with defined criteria and the particular individual&rsquo;s application was not among those approved for a licence. He subsequently reapplied for a licence and was informed by the Department that a licence could only be granted when all of the requirements of licensing policy, including the removal of replace<Col N="698" />ment capacity from the fishing boat register, were complied with.</P>
        <P>The other case relates to an application made by the company concerned, under EU legislation in place at the time, which provided for the introduction of additional capacity into the EU fleet, where additional fishing opportunities were identified. The licensing and registration of the vessel concerned was facilitated by a decision of the European Commission to grant additional capacity in respect of the Irish pelagic fleet segment, to take account of fishing opportunities in Mauritanian and other West African waters. The decision followed intensive negotiations at political and official level, mainly relating to the resolution of an engine power capacity excess problem in the pelagic segment, which had not been caused by the company concerned. Replacement capacity was not required to be provided in respect of the vessel in question as the European Commission allocated additional capacity, over and above existing fleet capacity limits, which allowed for its introduction. The company withdrew its other vessel from the fleet in order to resolve the excess engine power capacity situation, which the Commission had insisted first be resolved.</P>
        <P>New EU legislation governing fleet policy was introduced in 2002-03, which was followed in November 2003, by the introduction at national level of a comprehensive and transparent new national licensing policy. The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, which came into effect on 1 July 2003, transferred responsibility for sea-fishing boat licensing to the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats, which operates on an independent basis, subject to criteria set out in that Act. All applications for sea-fishing boat licences are now considered by the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats. The head of the licensing authority is the registrar general of fishing boats, a senior official in the Department. The 2003 Act also established an independent appeals system relating to licensing decisions subsequently taken.</P>

          <?oasys _dc14-?>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 221 and 222 on 24 May 2005, in which I stated that, on 18 May the Department received a letter from Dublin Port Company requesting ministerial approval for its proposal to enter into an arrangement with a consortium, as detailed in draft heads of terms attached to the letter. The company states that the proposal provides that, in the event that the consortium is successful in its bid for the development of the national conference centre and appropriate planning and other consent issue in respect of the national conference centre, Dublin Port Company will make a site available in order to facilitate the development of the centre, together with further and complementary commercial development.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
        <P>Dublin Port Company has also informed the Department that the entirely unsolicited approach to it by a consortium bidding for the <Col N="700" />national conference centre was of a unique nature and that had alternative proposals been received, they would have been similarly considered.</P>
        <P>As indicated in my reply on 18 May, the company&rsquo;s letter is being considered by the Department at present and a decision will be made in due course. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter while the company&rsquo;s request is under consideration.</P>

        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, announced in December 2003, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, currently based in Dublin, is scheduled to decentralise to Limerick. This will involve the relocation of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. Details of applications received for the posts in question, excluding applications from civil servants already serving in Limerick, are set out in the table which follows.</P>
        <P>The Department is working closely with the Office of Public Works to identify suitable accommodation for the directorate in Limerick and it is hoped to select a premises in the near <Col N="701" />future. Pending that, it is not possible to estimate savings or additional costs.</P>
        <P>
          <?oasys _dc14-?>The various issues arising from the Government decision, both for the Department in general and for the development co-operation directorate in particular, are considered in the Department&rsquo;s decentralisation implementation plan. Risk analysis carried out by the directorate in this context has identified several risk factors, for which appropriate risk mitigation strategies are being <Col N="702" />implemented: These are: financial, including accountability and control; human resources, including loss of expertise and institutional memory communications between the directorate and internal and external stakeholders; and associated operational and reputational risks The implementation plan, which has been published on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dfa.ie</i>, was recently revised to take account of the decision to include the directorate among the early movers.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>

        <P>Negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme between Iran and France, Germany and the UK, supported by the high representative for the common foreign and security policy, resulted in an agreement signed in Paris in November 2004 on nuclear issues and future co-operation. Under this agreement, which was endorsed by the European Council last December, Iran, <i>inter alia</i>, reaffirmed that it does not, and will not, seek to acquire nuclear weapons and committed itself to full transparency and cooperation with the IAEA. Iran, moreover, decided to voluntarily suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities <Col N="703" />and to invite the IAEA to verify and to monitor the suspension. The agreement further provided for negotiations on a long-term agreement, which will cover political and security issues; technology and cooperation; and nuclear issues.</P>
        <P>A steering committee to launch these negotiations met for the first time in December 2004 and established working groups on political and security issues, technology and cooperation and nuclear issues. Under the terms of the Paris agreement, the steering committee receives progress reports from the working groups and identifies projects and, or measures that can be implemented in advance of an overall agreement. The working groups met most recently on 19 April in Geneva and the steering committee met on 29 April in London.</P>
        <P>At the meeting of the IAEA board of governors last March, France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement in which they gave their preliminary assessment of the negotiations with Iran. They indicated that the negotiations have allowed for an extensive exchange of views, notably on ways to provide objective guarantees that Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes, as stipulated in the Paris agreement. The two sides have discussed long-term arrangements for co-operation between the EU and Iran in the political and security area, as well as in the economic and technological field. They have also explored the prospects for mutually acceptable arrangements for Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, which would provide objective guarantees that it could not be used for military purposes. In reiterating their commitment to the negotiation process, France, Germany and the United Kingdom stressed that it is essential that confidence be maintained through the continued implementation in good faith of all aspects of the Paris agreement.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, such confidence was undermined when Iran issued statements that suggested that it would re-commence some activities covered by voluntary suspension. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in response, wrote to Iran and called for a ministerial-level meeting, which took place on 25 May in Geneva. At a subsequent press conference, the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, commented that the two sides had a thorough discussion within the framework of the Paris agreement. He indicated that the European side would make detailed proposals to Iran by the end of July or the beginning of August, in the context of the Paris agreement remaining in force. During the meeting the European side again recognised Iran&rsquo;s rights to nuclear energy for peaceful uses under Article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, exercised in conformity with its non-proliferation obligations under the treaty, without discrimination, while Iran reaffirmed its commitment not to seek nuclear weapons.</P>

        <P>The following bilateral agreements concluded between the State and the United Kingdom have entered into force since September 1999: &mdash; agreement between the two Governments &mdash; British/Irish Agreement &mdash; Belfast, 10 April 1998, entered into force on 2 December 1999; &mdash; agreement establishing a British-Irish Council, Dublin, 8 March 1999, entered into force on 2 December 1999; &mdash; agreement establishing a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, Dublin, 8 March 1999, entered into force on 2 December 1999 &mdash; agreement establishing implementation bodies, Dublin, 8 March 1999, entered into force on 2 December, 1999; &mdash; agreement establishing a North-South Ministerial Council, Dublin, 8 March 1999, entered into force on 2 December 1999; &mdash; exchange of letters, dated 18 June 1999, constituting an agreement supplementary to the agreement between the two Governments establishing implementation bodies, Dublin, 8 March 1999, entered into force on 2 December 1999; &mdash; exchange of letters, dated 27 September 2000 and 10 October 2000 amending the agreement between the two Governments concerning the International Fund for Ireland, entered into force on 10 October 2000; &mdash; exchange of notes dated 18 October 2001 and 31 October 2001 constituting an agreement pursuant to Article 83 paragraph 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 on the provisional delimitation of an area of the continental shelf, entered into force on 31 October 2001; &mdash; exchange of notes dated 19 November 2002 concerning certain decisions of the North-South Ministerial Council and related matters, entered into force on 3 December 2002; &mdash; agreement on police co-operation, Belfast, 29 April 2002, entered into force on 20 December 2002; &mdash; agreement establishing the Independent Monitoring Commission, Dublin, 25 November 2003, entered into force on 7 January 2004; &mdash; agreement on the early notification of a nuclear accident or incident of radiological significance and the exchange of information concerning the operation and management of nuclear facilities or activities, Dublin, 10 December 2004, entered into force on 10 December 2004.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the requirements of Article 29.5.1&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, all of these agreements have been laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann following their entry into force. In addition, for the convenience of the public, they have also been published in the Irish treaty series by my <Col N="705" />Department and have been made available on the Department&rsquo;s website,<i> www.dfa.ie/treaties</i>.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing treaties, I am aware of a further two bilateral agreements concluded with the United Kingdom that have been signed on behalf of Ireland but that have not yet entered into force. These are the convention on social security, signed in Dublin on 14 December 2004 and the agreement relating to the transmission of natural gas by a second pipeline between Ireland and the United Kingdom, and through a connection to the Isle of Man, signed at Gormanstown on 24 September 2004. Both agreements are expected to enter into force shortly.</P>

        <P>Following entry into force of a treaty with respect to the State it has long been the practice of my Department to arrange simultaneously for its registration with the Secretary General of the United Nations, pursuant to Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations and for its publication in the Irish treaty series. I am not aware of any bilateral agreement concluded with the United Kingdom that has been registered with the United Nations but not published in the treaty series.</P>
        <P>I am aware of only two instances of bilateral treaties concluded with the United Kingdom and registered with the League of Nations pursuant to Article 18 of its covenant that were not also published in the treaty series. These were the treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, signed at London on 6 December 1921 and the agreement amending and supplementing the treaty of December 6, 1921, between Great Britain and the Irish Free State, signed in London on 3 December 1925.</P>
        <P>These agreements were concluded prior to the commencement of publication of the treaty series in 1930. They were, in due course, amended by the agreements between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom, signed in London on 25 April 1938 and printed as Number 1 of 1938 in the Irish treaty series.</P>

        <P>On 19 May, I launched the plans for the future development of the Battle of the Boyne site at Oldbridge. This next phase of development will transform the site into a welcoming and significant visitor experience which will encourage and facilitate an understanding of the battle and an appreciation for the environment in which it took place.</P>
        <P>As invoices are still outstanding, the full costs of this launch have not yet been finalised. The principal costs related to the provision of a marquee and electricity generator, given the absence of on-site facilities, and the supply of catering services. It is estimated that the overall cost will be in the region of &euro;13,000.</P>
        <P>It is not normal practice for this Department to provide the names of those invited to official functions. A broad cross-section of people with an interest in the development of the battle site were present at the launch on 19 May. These included local residents and community groups, a number of public representatives and local government officials, representatives of the loyal orders and of the Ulster-Scots community in Northern Ireland, military historians and others who have taken a supportive interest in the development of the site since it was acquired by the State in 1999.</P>

        <P>The priority to now has been to support the 55 projects that applied for funding. Of these 55 projects, 25 have been allocated grant aid.

        <P>The question of re-opening the programme will be considered following an expenditure review of the programme which is being carried out by my Department and which is expected to be completed later this year.

        <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The EU-US summit at Dromoland in June 2004 adopted several declarations, including a declaration on strengthening our economic partnership. The Irish Presidency of the European Union played a key role in ensuring that there was a strong economic dimension to the summit and to the enhancement of ongoing EU-US relations. Following this summit declaration, both the EU and US sides commenced a stakeholder dialogue and invited interested parties to offer their views on how this should be done. Drawing on the results of the stakeholder dialogue in which replies were received from the business community, trade unions, consumer organisations and other interested groups, the European Commission for its part has identified areas that should be tackled to develop a forward-looking strategy to enhance the economic relationship between the US and the EU.</P>
        <P>The Commission communication of 19 May 2005 &mdash; A stronger EU-US partnership and a more open market for the 21st century &mdash; addressed to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, forms the basis of the initiatives proposed by the European Commission designed to boost EU-US trade and investment in specific areas. In its communication, the European Commission proposes a mix of binding and non-binding approaches, across sectors, with the aim of giving new impetus and quality to the EU-US economic relationship.</P>
        <Col N="711" />
        <P>The economic agenda includes both multilateral and bilateral elements. Obviously, both sides are committed to concluding a successful Doha round and both are working to secure a successful outcome at the next WTO trade ministerial conference in Hong Kong at the end of this year. The EU for its part, in accordance with the EU&rsquo;s international trade policy which has been built for several decades on a preference for a multilateral approach, is fully supportive of and continues to maintain this strategic approach. On bilateral co-operation, the emphasis is on regulatory co-operation, co-operation on technology and innovation and market access issues.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports working closely with the US on this forward-looking agenda with both its multilateral and bilateral components. We see it as an appropriate and balanced approach with the potential to enhance trade and investment between the EU and the US. Discussions among the European Commission and member states are ongoing to agree the elements of this agenda which will be put on the table for discussion and agreement at the next EU-US summit to be held next month.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>Broad employment and training objectives and policies to promote the employment of disabled people, including schemes, programmes and services, are reflected in the statements of strategy and business plans of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S. F&Aacute;S programmes and the various support measures are based on the policies of the Department, which are developed through a three dimensional approach involving the following: facilitating the progression of disabled people into sustainable employment through the development of their skills; stimulating awareness amongst employers of the contribution which disabled people can make to their business and encouraging companies to consider actively recruiting disabled people to fill their vacancies; and providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities now benefit from the full range of F&Aacute;S training programmes and services and F&Aacute;S also provides an extensive range of schemes and grants to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector, including the disability awareness training support scheme, the employment retention grant, the work and equipment adaptation grant, the job interview interpreter grant, the personal reader grant and the employment support scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, F&Aacute;S also operates on behalf of the Department a pilot programme for employment of people with disabilities, PEP, grant assistance for commercially viable enterprises of which at least 50% of the employees are people with disabilities; and supported employment programme, which is an open labour market initiative that works towards the placement of and support of people with different types and varying degrees of disability who need <Col N="714" />the initial support of a job coach to obtain or maintain employment.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have secured additional funding for the development and introduction of a new full-time employment support scheme for people with disabilities on a three-year pilot basis. A budget line of &euro;10 million has been established for the scheme for 2005. This comprises the current provision of &euro;5 million for the combined employment support scheme and the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities and an additional &euro;5 million. The scheme will be implemented by F&Aacute;S this summer. The total number of people with disabilities placed in employment and training by F&Aacute;S in 2004 was 8,608 compared with 8,459 in 2003.</P>
        <P>The wide-ranging NDA report, entitled Towards Best Practice in the Provision of Further Education, Employment and Training Services, contains a total of 29 recommendations which have implications for a number of Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the area of employment and training provision. In this area, 19 of these recommendations have policy and-or operational implications for F&Aacute;S under the aegis of the Department. These recommendations are being addressed by F&Aacute;S in conjunction with the Department and are of assistance in the context of the ongoing monitoring and review of policy and programme provision consistent with providing the most efficient services possible to people with disabilities. My Department&rsquo;s objective in the period ahead is to consolidate the significant value added in advancing the employment and training agenda since assuming policy responsibility for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities.</P>

        <P>A small business is defined by the European Commission as one that employs fewer than 50 people and has a turnover or balance sheet total of less than &euro;10 million. My Department provided funding and support to small businesses in 2004 through a number of relevant state agencies which operate under the aegis of my Department, namely, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, the county and city enterprise boards and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland &mdash; EI &mdash; is the national development agency with primary responsibility for assisting the development of indigenous <Col N="715" />enterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector. More than 80% of EI&rsquo;s clients are small businesses. EI&rsquo;s assistance is delivered by way of both financial and non-financial supports. Financial supports are designed to encourage development and growth at key stages in a client&rsquo;s development, for example, start-up or early stage, expansions etc., and consists of both grants and equity finance. With regard to non-financial support, EI provides expertise to its clients not only in relation to the business functions listed previously but also with regard to the crucial endeavour of developing exports. In this regard, EI has a network of more than 30 overseas offices positioned to provide clients with market information and assisting client contact with potential buyers.</P>
        <P>Total financial support paid out by Enterprise Ireland to client SMEs &mdash; firms with up to 250 employees &mdash; in 2004 amounted to &euro;82 million. However, a breakdown of this figure between small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises is not readily available.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development is responsible for both foreign direct Investment and indigenous industry in the Shannon Free Zone and in the remainder of the Shannon region &mdash; Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary, north Kerry and south-west Offaly. In 2004, Shannon Development paid some &euro;3.4 million to 100 companies that employ fewer than 50 people each.</P>
        <P>The 35 county and city enterprise boards &mdash; CEBs &mdash; have the primary responsibility for support to micro businesses &mdash; businesses with ten employees or fewer. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the boards can support individuals, firms and community groups. The boards give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services companies which over time may develop into strong export entities.</P>
        <P>In 2004, a total of &euro;16.5 million of capital funding was made available to micro-enterprises by the CEBs of which &euro;10.5 million related to project support expenditure in the form of capital grants, feasibility study grants and employment grants. In total, 864 CEB clients were approved for direct financial assistance by the boards in 2004. The balance of funding provided, approximately &euro;6 million, was spent on the provision of soft support activities &mdash; advice, management training, e-commerce training, enterprise education, mentoring and the promotion of female entrepreneurship. More than 15,000 people participated in the wide range of training and development courses offered by the CEBs countrywide.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S, the national training and employment authority, also has a role in supporting the small business sector through the provision of a range of advisory and human resource development services to business, including small business. It <Col N="716" />works closely with companies to assist them identify their current and emerging training needs and to implement training and development initiatives to meet these. It also assists industry search for suitable candidates to fill job vacancies. Given that the focus is on upskilling the labour force generally, it is not possible to identify the level of F&Aacute;S spending that specifically benefits small businesses.</P>
        <P>In addition to the targeted interventions by various State enterprise development agencies, the small business sector in Ireland is supported and encouraged by the active pursuit and promotion by the Government of an economic environment that is supportive of entrepreneurial activity. Ireland&rsquo;s extraordinary success over the past decade has been built on, and continues to be built on, such key competitive strengths as having one of the lowest taxation regimes in Europe, access to the EU&rsquo;s internal market, a well educated and skilled workforce and a history of Government policies that are pro-business and provide a benign business environment. The Government is committed to the continued support and development of these strengths.</P>

        <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s attitude to the UK paper on the economic partnership agreements being negotiated by the European Commission with 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries; if, in accordance with the concern expressed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Government will join the UK and other like-minded Governments with a view to changing the EU position on EPAs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to the response to Question No. 270 of 4 May 2005 on the same issue. The position remains unchanged since that time. EPAs are first and foremost instruments for development that will foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy. Substantive negotiations are under way between the EU and ACP states in this regard. As trade is a EU competence, it is the European Commission which conducts the negotiations on the EPAs between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP states on behalf of member states on the basis of an agreed mandate. The Commission provides the Council with updates on the progress of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>I have read with interest the recent position paper that sets out the UK view on how best the commitment to put development at the heart of the EPA negotiations can be delivered. I agree with the basic thrust of an approach to the EPAs which ensures that the needs and concerns of <Col N="717" />developing countries are taken adequately into consideration during the substantive phase of these negotiations. More recently in the context of the further progression of EPA negotiations, Commissioner Mandelson has indicated that he is putting the EPA process under continuing review, with a new review mechanism to ensure that at every stage in the negotiations the development dimension is put first. I fully support this approach by the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations process and will continue to do so. In so far as the discussions within the European Council, including the Article 133 committee, are concerned, Ireland will have full regard to the content of the UK paper. In all these discussions, we will be insisting that the Commission discharge its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou agreement and in a manner which is sensitive to the particular concerns of ACP states.</P>

        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its <Col N="718" />regions. During 2004, a total of six companies were involved in greenfield start-ups in the Border, midlands and western region. By 2004, a total of 41% of all new greenfield jobs created by IDA Ireland-supported companies were located in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made in attracting new jobs to the BMW region given that in 1999, prior to the start of the Government&rsquo;s current national development programme, only 25% of all new greenfield jobs were locating in the region. IDA Ireland continues to make every effort to maximise the proportion of new greenfield investment locating in the BMW area.</P>

        <P>The national competitiveness council, NCC, in its Annual Competitiveness Report 2004 mentioned the issue of insurance costs in Ireland. The NCC&rsquo;s commentary was based on data published by Swiss Re Sigma. These data, which are based on 2003 figures, depict insurance premia <i>per capita</i> for non-life insurance for 16 countries. This includes both motor and public liability insurance. It should be noted that these data cover expenditure on insurance, which is only a proxy for the relative price of similar insurance services in different countries. These data cannot be seen as a definitive competitiveness barometer for insurance costs.</P>
        <P>Of the 16 countries surveyed, Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on non-life insurance was the fifth highest, with a value of $1,356. Switzerland was the highest with a value of $2,228, the United States was second highest with a value of $1,980, the Netherlands was third with a value of $1,532 and the United Kingdom, with a value of $1,441 was fourth highest. Hungary was the second lowest with a value of $148, while Poland was the cheapest with a value of $102. The average expenditure for the EU15 was $974 and the OECD&rsquo;s average was $1,008.</P>
        <P>However, these figures need to be analysed carefully as they do not always include only or all premia paid by the inhabitants of the country concerned. The NCC also reported that the use of a tort system in Ireland increases private pre<Col N="724" />mia <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Europe and the USA where the use of a no fault system reduces the level of expenditure on insurance premia.</P>
        <P>Recent experience in Ireland indicates that the cost of insurance is falling as a result of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme. The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for a number of classes of insurance. These statistics show that there was a reduction of 20% in motor car insurance between the months of April 2002, when the first motor insurance advisory board report was published, and October 2004. There are also reported reductions in the cost of premia for public and employer liability insurance.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282, 284 and 288 together.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to determine the number of manufacturing or service jobs that have relocated <Col N="725" />to more competitive economies in the past five years or the employment change arising directly from just one aspect affecting the enterprise economy. Firms relocate for a variety of reasons. Relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise related issues that determine employment levels. Firms invest in different regions for a variety of reasons and while there is little doubt that some firms establish themselves primarily to take advantage of reduced costs in lower wage economies, this is often not the only factor in deciding where to invest.</P>
        <P>The tabular statement provides a breakdown of employment gains/losses in agency supported firms for the last five years for the manufacturing and services &mdash; financial and international &mdash; sectors.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economy has undergone a fundamental change in the last decade and can no longer be seen as a low cost location for investment. High output and productivity together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards now typify Ireland&rsquo;s economy. We no longer operate primarily as a location for what could be called low tech production; other low wage economies provide a level of cost competitiveness for this form of production that we can no longer realistically match.</P>
        <P>As the figures on the statement indicate, our economy is holding firm in the service sectors and, as Ireland becomes more economically sophisticated, services are likely to become a much more important source of wealth and employment creation. Nevertheless, we are acutely aware of the importance of manufacturing and we cannot afford to be complacent about erosion in employment in such an important economic sector. While the figures show that over the period 2001-03 we suffered heavy losses in this sector among agency supported firms, there are some indications that the level of attrition may <Col N="726" />have peaked and, indeed, given the problems besetting the world economy during those years, we should recognise this as a strong performance in the circumstances of a global downturn.</P>
        <P>Enterprise policy is being actively refocused towards creating conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skill, knowledge intensive activities, in which advanced manufacturing expertise will be an important contributor to growth and employment. The range of incentives provided through the enterprise development agencies are designed to meet these objectives and to help enterprise operate at higher levels of skill, undertake higher order strategic investments, product development and innovation. The agencies are active and supportive partners with enterprise in helping new, market oriented investment projects.</P>
        <P>Manufacturing remains a core sector in our economy. This is reflected in changes to tax rules to encourage more research and development activity to take place here, particularly in the area of high value added and customer driven innovation. The sustainability of employment levels in manufacturing is heavily tied to the sustainability of their competitiveness both in terms of delivering products and services in Ireland and in export markets. To this end, Enterprise Ireland is working with its client base to improve the productivity of this important aspect of our industrial base in line with its new strategy, which I launched on 4 May 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to developing a competitive economy that will be resilient to competitive pressures from today&rsquo;s global economy. This involves maintaining a pro-business environment that will provide firms with a solid stable platform from which they can successfully compete on both domestic and international markets, helping to make Ireland one of the most attractive locations in the world from which to do business.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The results of the recently published Institute for Management Development, IMD, report indicate that Ireland is in 12th position in the overall world competitiveness yearbook rankings. In 2004, Ireland scored tenth overall. While the IMD report is a useful data source, all forms of international benchmarking should be treated with caution. Ireland was ranked 22nd in the 1995 report yet was the fastest growing economy in the subsequent ten year period, with GDP growth of 4.9% and an unemployment rate of just 4.5% in 2004.</P>
        <P>Benchmarking exercises can only measure a small subset of the economic factors. For some economic factors, there is great difficulty in finding directly comparable, reliable and timely indicators for an appropriate range of comparator countries, while for many others no economic indicators are available at all. The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s, NCC, Annual Competitiveness Report 2005, while using some IMD indicators, will provide a better insight than international reports into specific Irish competitiveness challenges. This report will be published around the middle of the year.</P>
        <P>Maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a competitive and profitable European location from which to do business is a key priority for my Department. It is fair to accept that our economy is undergoing fundamental change and we can no longer compete as a low cost location for basic manufacturing investment. Our strength and competitive advantages, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> emerging economies and rapidly developing overseas growth centres, has changed considerably over the past few years. Primarily this arises because we have become a modern, advanced European economy, with all the associated advantages of high incomes, living standards, employment growth and social services.</P>
        <P>While manufacturing faces particular challenges, globalisation is creating significant opportunities as services have significant trading sectors. Internationally traded services will be a growing source of high skilled, knowledge intensive jobs and competitive advantage over the next decade. Manufacturing now represents 23% of total employment, whereas the services sector accounts for 62% of total employment, 31% of exports and over 50% of total GDP. With the increasing emphasis on developing Ireland as a knowledge based economy, it is expected the services sector will to continue to expand in the future.</P>
        <P>In a global business world it is inevitable that the investment decisions of some companies will be influenced by the competitive attractions of alternative geographic locations. My Department and its agencies are acutely aware of this. Our focus is firmly concentrated on managing this transition with the best possible blend of policies to strengthen both national and firm level competitiveness.</P>
        <Col N="728" />
        <P>Ireland operates in a global economy and market forces influencing investment decisions will be both pervasive and unrelenting. Our response to this challenge is strategic yet reflects the business needs of companies. A key element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to help enterprise is to encourage increased levels of investment in research, business related technological development and innovation across all enterprise sectors. This will assist firms to produce improved, value added products and services. In the longer term this will provide more sustainable and higher quality jobs.</P>
        <P>Innovations in the support package available to investors, such as the changes to the taxation treatment for head office operations and research and development, are helping secure new forms of investment. These policy innovations clearly demonstrate the high priority the Government accords to ensuring that Ireland aligns its business supports and competitive characteristics to the requirements of doing business here. They also show that our enterprise policies are creative and flexible to capture the opportunities presented by globalisation.</P>
        <P>Following the policy prescriptions contained in the enterprise strategy group report I asked Enterprise Ireland to rethink how we could better support the competitive position of indigenous firms in the face of intensifying global competition. I recently gave the agency a strong mandate to restructure its operations when launching its new strategy to transform Irish industry. Enterprise Ireland will develop closer relationships between Irish firms and third level colleges to increase levels of applied research. This will ensure that market led innovation becomes an integral part of the competitive strategy of individual companies and strengthens Ireland&rsquo;s long term competitiveness.</P>

        <P>The population and labour force projections compiled by the Central Statistics Office project immigration over the next five years, depending on the assumptions used, to be either 41,000 or 51,000 per annum, while the net inward migration is projected to be 20,000 or 30,000. These projections are based on recent migration trends and would include migrants who may not enter the labour force.</P>
        <P>In 2004, 34,000 work permits were issued and of this number over 10,000 related to new applications. In addition, in the last year 80,000 <Col N="729" />nationals of the ten new member states entered the State, of which it is estimated that over 50,000 entered the labour force. Taking into account these statistics, along with the number of returning Irish immigrants, the large student working population and immigration from the EU15, I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s labour needs will be met in the years ahead. To this end the new Employment Permits Bill, now being finalised, will contain provisions which will enable me to respond quickly and flexibly to skills shortages as they arise.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>Exploiting the prospects offered by EU states, particularly the new accession states, and non-EU states, such as China, will be critical for the future growth of the Irish economy. Ireland is a country with a relatively limited domestic market for products and services. Consequently, it is essential that Irish companies which wish to develop their full potential continue to focus on internationalisation activities and strategies. Clearly, the substantial public and private investment in capital, human resources and innovation made in recent years will go unrewarded if Irish companies are unable to successfully sell products and services in overseas markets.</P>
        <P>Developing the indigenous enterprise base by improving its internationalisation capabilities is a priority for the Government. The ESG report, Ahead of the Curve &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s Place in the Global Economy, provided a blueprint for the actions required to build on Ireland&rsquo;s position as a developed economy. Following detailed Government consideration of the ESG&rsquo;s recommendations and the publication of the ESG action plan, Enterprise Ireland was requested to respond creatively to the recommendations outlined in the plan. In particular, Enterprise Ireland was asked to focus on how best to accelerate the development and internationalisation of Irish owned business.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategic plan, 2005-07, Transforming Irish Industry, launched in May <Col N="730" />2005, is the agency&rsquo;s response to the challenges set. It represents a major change in the approach of the agency and will, I believe, make a substantial contribution to the further growth of Irish companies. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy recognises that the internationalisation of Irish firms is essential for the establishment of Irish global players. Delivering quality sales and partnering opportunities for Irish companies in key sectors and markets will be a major focus for the agency.</P>
        <P>As part of the new strategy, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 33 overseas offices, present both in EU and non-EU countries, now report to a centralised international sales and partnering division. Overseas office staff are now aligned on a sectoral basis with their counterparts in Ireland to enhance customer support and teamwork. This will provide an even clearer focus on the needs of Irish companies as EI assists them create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth. Specific targets have been established in terms of new export sales, with a target pledged of &euro;3 billion over the next three years.</P>
        <P>As part of the strategy, later this year Enterprise Ireland will also bring forward proposals on a joint pilot initiative with F&Aacute;S specifically designed to increase international sales and marketing skills within Irish firms. This initiative is being developed in consultation with client companies and will determine the direction and focus of future schemes.</P>
        <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s productivity improvement fund was launched in May. The fund, which totals &euro;20 million, will be allocated to companies on a competitive tendering basis and will assist Irish firms adopt advanced technologies and help them focus on managerial and skills development. This is designed to improve their competitive position. This support will ensure sustainable productivity improvements in recipient companies, which will ultimately increase exports or establish a solid base from which companies can develop their exports. Details of the fund are available on the Enterprise Ireland website.</P>
        <P>My Department also recently undertook an evaluation of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas office network and made a number of recommendations which Enterprise Ireland is currently implementing. The evaluation found a clear rationale and need for the overseas office network. It also found that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients view the network as playing a considerable role in export development. The network will continue to play a crucial role in developing exports in the coming years.</P>

        <Quest>the number of manufacturing jobs lost in County Kildare in the past two years; if, in either or any case, such jobs relocated to other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The tabular statement sets out the gains and losses in manufacturing jobs of agency supported companies in County Kildare in the years 2003-04. These data are only compiled on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>As the statement indicates, there has been a net increase in agency supported jobs in the manufacturing sector in Kildare over the two year period of 589. Overall permanent employment in agency supported firms in County Kildare has increased from 9,171 in 1995 to 16,094 in 2004, an increase of over 75% which is significantly above the national average.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to advise on the extent to which jobs lost in the period 2003-04 have been lost directly through relocation. Relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise related issues that determine employment levels. Firms invest in different regions for a variety of reasons and while there is little doubt that some firms establish themselves primarily to take advantage of reduced costs in lower wage economies, this is often not the only factor in deciding where to invest.</P>
        <P>To counterbalance the competitive threat from lower wage competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of productivity and value added products and services. The application of technology and intellectual endeavour is becoming more important than simple cost competitiveness as the foundation for growth and prosperity. Sustainable employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy and are, therefore, less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years the enterprise support agencies under my Department have been mandated to adjust their support strategies to meet both the needs of society in terms of high quality employment opportunities and the needs of businesses that generate and sustain those jobs.</P>
        <P>Kildare continues to thrive across a broad range of activities in a number of important sectors. As a result, many job opportunities are being created within the county. IDA Ireland, in addition to targeting potential new projects, is also working with its existing client base with a view to supporting these companies with expansion and diversification of their activities, which will strengthen their presence in the region. I recently performed the official opening of the new International Fund Services (Ireland) Limited office in Naas, which is on target to employ 140 people by end 2005 and 240 by end 2006. In <Col N="732" />2004, we saw the announcement of the largest ever ICT investment in the country, &euro;1.6 billion, by Intel and a &euro;21.4 million technology development centre by Hewlett Packard. A number of other large overseas companies continue to provide job opportunities.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in assisting Kildare based client companies to grow and develop their businesses. Since the beginning of 2002, EI has approved &euro;9.3 million in support to companies to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development, in order that they can compete on world markets. Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs and also in enhancing innovation capability at a national and regional level, through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also works with other local agencies and organisations in the county to develop the local business infrastructure and is represented on all of the major development committees in the county. The development of community based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise through the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro-enterprises through local community participation. Enterprise Ireland has supported the development of community enterprise centres in Kildare, at Allenwood, Clane and Athy, which are significantly contributing to job creation.</P>
        <P>Kildare has also benefited from a significant investment in recent years in technological infrastructure in NUI Maynooth. This will be the key to ensuring that Kildare is an attractive location for knowledge based industry in future years. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the enterprise development agencies will continue to maximise sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Kildare.</P>

        <P>Detailed data relating to the amount of social insurance contributions remitted by the child care sector is not held by my Department in a form which is suitable for directly estimating the cost of abolishing employers PRSI in their case. However, based on data from the national child care census report baseline data 1999-2000, it is tentatively estimated that exempting child care providers from liability for PRSI would have cost in the region of &euro;5.5 million in respect of employers contributions.</P>
        <P>My Department currently provides scope for employers in this sector and others to avail of reduced PRSI contributions through the PRSI exemption scheme. This scheme allows employers to employ additional eligible workers and be exempt from liability to pay the employers contribution of PRSI for the first two years of the employment.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>There are currently three types of payments within the social welfare system: universal, which is payable regardless of contributions or income, for example, child benefit; insurance, which is payable according to contributions paid into the social insurance fund; assistance, which is payable based on need and subject to certain contingencies such as unemployment or old age &mdash; these payments feature a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those most in need.</P>
        <P>The abolition of means tests for social welfare purposes would represent a fundamental change in income maintenance provision in the State. Such an abolition would also directly impact on the existing social insurance system. It would, therefore, be necessary to determine the underlying conditions attaching to any new non-means tested scheme or schemes which might replace the existing means tested schemes and, possibly, social insurance based schemes, before a tentative estimate of the cost and associated administrative implications could be provided.</P>

        <P>As part of the annual Estimates and budgetary cycles, my Department estimates the level of PRSI contribution revenue which can be expected in the coming year and also the impact <Col N="734" />of any possible changes in the key parameters within the PRSI system, such as contribution rates, earnings thresholds for different payment rates, the employee PRSI free allowance and the ceiling on employees contributions. Estimates for the 2006 fiscal year will be undertaken later this year when Department of Finance projections for employment and earnings changes are undertaken.</P>
        <P>Pre-budget 2005 Estimates provided an opportunity to estimate the possible impact of rates changes on social insurance contribution revenue in the 2005 fiscal year. Estimates were based on a random sample of class A employments from our main client database in respect of fiscal year 2002 and then uprated to take account of changes in the labour force and in earnings since then. It was estimated that a one percentage point increase in the higher employer PRSI contribution rate, leaving all other parameters unchanged, would have yielded in the region of &euro;360 million over and above an unchanged rates scenario. An increase in the lower employer PRSI rate would have yielded around &euro;57 million in a full year if all other parameters were left unchanged. An increase of one percentage point in the main, class A, contribution rate for employees would have yielded in the region of &euro;262 million in a full financial year.</P>
        <P>The Estimates shown are those for a full financial year and the precise impact in any budgetary year would depend on the date of implementation.</P>

The board, accordingly, terminated payment of her diet supplement in November 2004.

        <P>The person concerned was previously awarded carer&rsquo;s allowance at a reduced rate for the period August 2003 to 12 May 2004. However, due to a change in her circumstances she was disallowed carer&rsquo;s allowance with effect from 12 May 2004. She subsequently made contact with my Department again on 29 April 2005 seeking to have her claim reopened. Given the time span that has elapsed since she first applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance and the fact that her claim was terminated with effect from 12 May 2004, a new application form issued to her on 17 May 2005 for completion. This is my Department&rsquo;s standard procedure in cases where a considerable period of time has elapsed since a claim was terminated.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances it will not be necessary for her to submit further medical evidence.

        <P>In 2004, the total number of sick days recorded in my Department, of a total workforce of approximately 4,730, was 63,998 working days. This accounted for 6.6% of the potential working days in the year. The average number of sick days per employee was 13.5 working days and 92.4% of the total number of sick days were covered by medical certificates.</P>
        <P>A considerable proportion of the total number of sick days was accounted for by a small number of staff who were on long-term sick leave in the year. A total of 22% of all the sick days were accounted for by 74 staff who were on sick leave for at least six months in 2004. When the sick leave for these staff members is factored out, the average number of sick days per employee was 10.5 working days. A total of 22.7% of my Department&rsquo;s staff took no sick leave during the year and, overall, 38.8% took less than two days.</P>
        <P>My Department has identified the issue of addressing and minimising absenteeism as one of the priorities of its human resources strategy. It has now finalised, through its partnership process and in consultation with unions and staff associations, a comprehensive attendance management policy aimed at addressing the issues arising in the context of sickness absence in an effective and balanced manner.</P>

        <P>The treatment benefit scheme operated by my Department provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. The availability of these benefits is subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions. The PRSI contribution classes which qualify for treatment benefit are A, E, H and P.</P>
        <P>The PRSI contribution conditions relating to treatment benefit vary depending on the age of the insured person. A person under 21 years of age requires 39 weeks reckonable PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment. An insured person aged between 21 and 24 years is required to have 39 weeks reckonable PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurance and 39 weeks paid or credited in the tax year on which the claim is based. An insured person over the age of 25 years is required to have 260 weeks PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and 39 weeks reckonable insurance contributions paid or cred<Col N="737" />ited in the tax year on which the claim is based. For claims made in 2005 the relevant tax year is 2003.</P>
        <P>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has 38 reckonable contributions in the 2003 tax year. She does not, therefore, qualify for dental benefit.</P>

        <P>Since 1999, my Department has provided an annual respite care grant to people who are in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance. One condition for receiving the grant is that the person must be receiving a carer&rsquo;s allowance during the specified period. This year the specified period is 2 June to 8 June.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, in respect of her son, from 10 June 1999 to 25 May 2005. Her son died on 13 April 2005. She was paid the allowance for a further six weeks after the death, up to 25 May 2005, when payment ceased. Unfortunately, as she is not in receipt of the allowance during the specified period, she does not qualify for the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

        <P>Details of social welfare recipients&rsquo; immigration status are not held on my Department&rsquo;s computer systems. Accordingly, it is not possible to quantify expenditure relating specifically to asylum seekers. However, my Department&rsquo;s records show that expenditure in 2004 under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in cases where the head of household was a non-national was approximately &euro;117 million, through basic supplementary welfare, rent supplement and exceptional needs payments. The cost of the payment of weekly allowances to asylum seekers in direct provision in 2004 was &euro;800,000, which is included in the overall total of &euro;117 million set out above.</P>
        <P>The needs of asylum seekers are catered for under the direct provision system operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Through this service they are provided with accommodation and other facilities to meet their <Col N="738" />basic living requirements. An allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child is payable weekly to people in direct provision facilities.</P>
        <P>Following the introduction of the statutory habitual residency condition in May 2004, asylum seekers are generally not entitled to receive social welfare support. Since then, payment of this weekly direct provision allowance is being made on an administrative basis by Health Service Executive community welfare officers. This is an interim measure pending finalisation of arrangements by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to integrate payment of an allowance with its management of accommodation and related services for asylum seekers.</P>
        <P>It continues to be open to any asylum seeker to seek assistance for a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as unemployment payments, one-parent family payments, pensions, disability allowance and child benefit. Details of the numbers and costs involved in these categories are not available.</P>
        <P>Overall, I consider that payments to asylum seekers and their families are adequate, given the accommodation, food and other services available to them free of charge through direct provision facilities.</P>

        <P>My Department through its various social assistance schemes provides income supports to people to meet their basic living needs, including food, clothing, heat and light. Supplements are also payable in certain circumstances for specific needs, for example fuel allowances, rent supplements, living alone allowance for older people or the household benefits pack<Col N="739" />age for pensioners, eligible disabled people and carers.</P>
        <P>Where people on low incomes have particular medical conditions or dietary requirements, diet supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding for school meals under two strands, namely the urban school meals scheme and the local projects scheme. The urban school meals scheme operates in conjunction with certain local authorities and is co-funded by my Department. The local projects scheme provides funding to secondary, national, pre-schools and community groups in both urban and rural areas who provide school meals.</P>
        <P>For families with school-going children, school meals can make a real and important contribution to ensuring that children receive better nutrition. Such services can also contribute to improved school attendance and quality of learning.</P>
        <P>The 2005 provision for the school meals programme is &euro;6.38 million. In addition, it is expected that expenditure on diet supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will amount to &euro;7 million this year.</P>
        <P>In recent years, budgetary increases in social welfare payment rates have consistently exceeded increases in the cost of living. This key policy is the primary focus of budget allocations to my Department each year, and it has helped ensure that those depending on social welfare experience real improvement in their ability to meet their basic needs, including provision of adequate food, heating etc.</P>
        <P>In this regard, consumer price index information from the Central Statistics Office indicates that the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages has increased by less than 3% in aggregate in the three and a half year period since 2001. The cost of these items has actually decreased in recent months and now stands at levels comparable to those in 2002. Social welfare rates have been increased very significantly in this period.</P>
        <P>I consider that this policy of providing real increases in primary social insurance and assistance payment rates is the most effective way overall of improving the standard of living of those who depend on social welfare income, with measures to support and encourage people of working age to take up employment or educational opportunities to help improve their financial position.</P>
        <P>At a broader level, I endorse the calls made recently for the food industry to take an active and responsible attitude in improving the nutritional quality of food and to inform and educate people generally about better nutrition and healthy eating options at affordable prices.</P>
        <P>I will continue to keep this issue under review, particularly in the context of the recent task force report on tackling obesity.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 311 together.</P>
        <P>Numerous meetings have taken place between the Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA, representatives and the companies and also with previous Ministers and officials from my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance to discuss the pension scheme. I met representatives of the group on 19 January last. The main RASA claim relates to salary and CPI indexation of their pensions.</P>
        <P>As the pensions are being paid in line with the terms of the scheme, there has been no obvious solution to the RASA concerns despite detailed examination. However, I indicated at that meeting that I would ask the companies concerned to keep the matter under review. One of the difficulties with the scheme is that it is a multi-employer scheme which, in addition to Aer Lingus and DAA staff, also includes a private sector company, SR Technics, formerly FLS Aerospace.</P>
        <P>While the payment of CPI is discretionary, I understand that other than for six years in the 1980s following a period when Irish inflation was at a very high level, the trustees have been able to increase pensions annually in line with the increase in CPI. In 2000, pensions were adjusted to the level they would have been at, had the full CPI increases been paid in the 1980s and since 1988, the scheme has increased pensions annually by the change in the CPI, including this year.</P>
        <P>In relation to claims about a deficit in the pension scheme, the last actuarial valuation which was carried out in March 2003 satisfied the minimum funding standard included in the Pension Act 1990. The next full actuarial valuation was due in March 2006 but the trustee decided to bring this forward to end March 2005. I understand that the report is expected to be finalised by the end of June.</P>
        <P>While the payment of pensions is always dependent on the actuarial position of the scheme, I understand that actuarial advice to date has been that the scheme is able to continue to pay the current level of pensions to existing pensioners. However, the question of whether such pensions can continue to be increased in line with inflation depends on the performance of the scheme going forward.</P>
        <P>If a deficit did arise, the rules of the pension scheme provide that the trustee has to decide what action to take but the rules also indicate that there is no obligation on the part of either employers or members to increase contributions. I assume that the trustee, employers and staff would work together in those circumstances to try and agree a mutually satisfactory outcome.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, formerly Aer Rianta, are matters primarily for the trustee, the members of the relevant scheme and the companies involved. The State <Col N="742" />has no involvement in the funding of these schemes. The question of an injection of State funds into the pension scheme, from whatever source, does not arise as any such proposal would run counter to established policy in this area and would, in all likelihood, be challenged by the European Commission as a state aid.</P>

The directive must be transposed into national law by 9 May 2006.</P>
        <Col N="744" />
        <P>Separately, proposals to extend the requirement for safety belts to be fitted to all seats in all new vehicles, except for buses used on stage stop routes, have been developed at EU level. Following the approval of the proposals by the European Parliament on 25 May 2005, the way is now open for their early adoption as directives so that new buses, including school buses, being registered from a date yet to be settled, perhaps late 2007, would require to be fitted with safety belts. This will eliminate the &ldquo;three for two&rdquo; rule for all newly registered buses.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the position arising from Directive 2003/20 and the EU proposals in relation to the fitment of safety belts to all seats in new motor vehicles, it is understood that the Minister for Education and Science is reviewing the scope to phase out the &ldquo;three for two&rdquo; arrangement in relation to buses used for school transport purposes.</P>
        <P>The question of safety belts in existing school buses is being considered by the Department of Education and Science and my Department within the framework outlined above.</P>

It is imperative that a sufficient population is in place in the catchment area of a station to justify its opening.

        <P>The crucial factor to be considered in any decision to reopen a railway line, is the likely scale and pace of development along the rail corridor in question. The greater the critical mass of population and economic activity, the more likely a sustainable case can be made for rail investment. I <Col N="745" />have already made it clear to local authorities in other parts of the country that it is for them to develop and implement land use strategies which would support the case for rail investment. The best practical demonstration to date of such an approach is the development of the Midleton rail corridor.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 321 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is funding the provision of public transport in rural areas through the rural transport initiative, RTI. This is a scheme, operating since 2002, to provide funding on a pilot basis for 34 community organisations to address the particular transport needs of their rural area through the provision of local transport services. It is not proposed to expand the number of RTI projects until the conclusion of the pilot phase at end 2006.</P>
        <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, administers the RTI on behalf of my Department. ADM and the individual RTI groups are solely responsible for all the operational aspects of the RTI, including the areas to be served, and neither I nor my Department has any role in these matters.</P>
        <P>This year I have allocated &euro;4.5 million for the RTI, which is a 50% increase on the allocation for 2004. I have also decided to put the initiative on a permanent financial footing from 2007. In developing proposals for a more permanent RTI, I will pay particular attention to the views of all those involved in the pilot phase of the RTI and to the transport needs of rural communities such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>

        <P>The penalty points system, which was provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002, has been operating since October 2002. Penalty points apply to four major traffic offences. These are speeding, seat belt wearing, driving without insurance and careless driving offences and by 30 April 2005 points have been recorded in respect of 232,820 drivers.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system was designed on the basis that its operation would be supported by a series of linked IT projects. The national driver file is fully operational and other IT support systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which will be available later this year, will facilitate a major extension of the operation of the system.

        <P>As the Deputy is aware my Department, supported by Area Development Management, ADM, Limited is responsible for co-ordinating the RAPID programme. The manner in which applications from RAPID areas are treated in my Department varies depending on the funding stream.</P>
        <P>A dedicated fund of &euro;7.5 million is provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2005 to co-fund small-scale proposals from RAPID plans with other Departments or local agencies. This fund is aimed exclusively at RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>In addition, special provision was made for RAPID areas under the dormant accounts plan. Under the current round of funding &euro;60 million is being allocated by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, of which a minimum of 52% is being targeted for RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas.</P>
        <P>RAPID areas are also included in the areas that are funded under the local drugs task force and young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund. Therefore funding allocated under these measures, by their nature, support RAPID areas and groups.</P>
        <P>Funding under the programme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations operated by my Department supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups which address disadvantage in their communities. While this is not specifically aimed at RAPID areas, projects from RAPID areas benefit from this funding.</P>
        <P>In the most recent and final expansion phase of the community development programme, priority was given to the inclusion of projects that were based in RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas. Fifteen such projects were included in the community development programme in 2003. If the Deputy has a particular group or organisation in mind and he contacts my Department, more precise information will be supplied.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputy to my colleague&rsquo;s reply of 4 May 2005 to a related question by Deputy Billy Timmins. As indicated in that reply, the Government is committed to a viable and sustainable rural post office network providing a range of services to meet customer needs as set out in the programme for Government. The network is geared towards customer demand in both urban and rural locations and must be adaptable to changing circumstances and trends but the core objective of the Government continues to be the retention of access to post office services in as many locations as possible.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. There is no means test in connection with the scheme. The only criteria are that the individual applicant is over 65 years of age and has, in the opinion of the local community group, a genuine need for the security equipment in each case. There are no plans at present to further extend this scheme.</P>
        <P>Prior to 2004, funding was provided at 90% of the cost of equipment. In 2004, following a review of the scheme, I replaced the 90% limit on funding with individual maximum grants in respect of the various scheme elements. In the case of socially-monitored alarm systems the maximum grant provided is &euro;300. The grant level was fixed at a realistic sum on the basis of grants sought and paid in the previous year by my Department.</P>
        <P>My officials have advised me that a number of suppliers of socially-monitored alarm systems quote under &euro;300 for the installation of socially-monitored alarms which are therefore, 100% grant aided and installed at no cost to the applicant.</P>
        <P>The scheme also provides grants for security equipment other than socially-monitored alarm systems as follows: &euro;150 in respect of door locks, window locks and door chains; &euro;150 in respect of security lighting; and &euro;50 in respect of smoke alarms.</P>
        <P>A figure of &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to the scheme of community supports for older people in 2005. This constitutes a 17% increase on the 2004 scheme, which received an allocation of &euro;2.4 million.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 to 345, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland implemented the single payment scheme in January 2005. The special beef premium scheme, along with the slaughter premium scheme, were the only schemes where the deadline for the receipt of applications was 31 December 2004. This meant that as many farmers as possible submitted their applications in late December 2004 in order that they could benefit from the special beef premium. Under the 2004 scheme, applications for in excess of 2.4 million animals were lodged, of which almost 1.4 million were quota animals, that is, first age bull animals. The application figure in each of the previous three years was 1.9 million animals. During December alone, applications in respect of 930,000 animals were submitted compared with 600,000 during December 2003.</P>
        <P>Following the receipt of such a large volume of applications in December, I took immediate steps to ensure that the applications were processed promptly. In the first instance, procedures were put in place to return the animal passports to the applicants prior to the end of the retention period. This was achieved, as it was important in order that farmers were in a position to dispose of their animals after the end of the retention period if they so wished.</P>
        <P>The processing of applications went ahead simultaneously in an efficient and effective manner. This processing involved computer validation and, where errors or inconsistencies were highlighted in such validation, those cases required individual attention. In many instances it was necessary to write to farmers to clarify the queries. Despite the number of December applications my Department was in a position to commence advance payments on these animals in early March.</P>
        <Col N="755" />
        <P>The issue of full balancing payments is dependent on the eligibility of all animals being established. As this required in many instances writing to farmers whose animals were not eligible for payment, it was clear to me that establishing the definitive overshoot reduction would take some months. This would mean that, in view of the integrated nature of the bovine premia schemes, the balancing payments on the suckler cow scheme, the special beef premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme could not be paid prior to June 2005 for applicants who claimed in excess of 25 animals under the special beef premium scheme.</P>
        <P>However, I was determined to make balancing payments to all farmers as soon as possible. In that regard, on 6 April 2005 measures were implemented which enabled the balancing payments to be made to special beef, suckler cow and slaughter premium applicants based on an estimated special beef premium scheme overshoot reduction. These balancing payments commenced in April 2005 and consequently farmers received payments in respect of the three schemes two months ahead of when they would otherwise have received them.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware of the impact that the overshoot reduction will have on beef farmers who claimed on more than 25 animals. The decision to opt for full decoupling was arrived at following careful consideration of all options and following a widespread public consultation process. A very persuasive factor in this process was the suggestion that farmers in those member states who fully decoupled would not be disadvantaged during the transitional period. The level of the overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004 and application patterns, both in terms of total numbers of animals applied upon and the timing of lodging of applications, strongly suggest this to be the case.</P>
        <P>I am seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner. I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions during various meetings. My Department also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter on 25 April 2005. The matter has been discussed with the Commissioner&rsquo;s Cabinet and with the most senior officials of the European Commission. Arrangements are being made for a meeting between my officials and the various services of the Commission&rsquo;s DG Agri.</P>
        <P>I am availing of every opportunity to press for appropriate measures be put in place to alleviate the difficulties encountered by beef farmers in Ireland as a result of the ending of the special beef premium in 2004. I will continue pursue the matter with the Agriculture Commissioner and Commission officials.</P>
        <Col N="756" />
        <P>Given the current position with regard to the processing of the 2004 scheme and the ongoing discussions with the Agriculture Commissioner on the quota overshoot, it is not possible at this stage, to be definitive about some of the issues raised.</P>

        <P>In excess of 17,200 applications have been received under the national reserve in my Department&rsquo;s Castlebar office and are being processed at present.

The scheme sets out the following examples of <i>force majeure</i> which may be recognised where an applicant is unable to meet the conditions of the scheme: death of the applicant; serious illness-incapacity of the applicant; compulsory acquisition of all or part of the agricultural holding which was not anticipated on joining the scheme; a natural disaster; the accidental destruction of livestock and-or farm buildings on the farm; an outbreak of disease affecting birds or animals on the farm; an order of court for separation or divorce resulting in the land subject to the scheme having to be divided or <Col N="757" />sold; and other court order. Other circumstances may also be recognised by my Department as constituting<i> force majeure</i>.

        <P>The installation aid scheme provides a grant of &euro;9,523 to farmers under the age of 35 who have been set up in farming for the first time and who meet certain education and income criteria. By virtue of the provisions of Article 8 of Council Regulation 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the EAGGF, grant aid may only be paid under the scheme in respect of, <i>inter alia</i>, farm holdings whose economic viability can be demonstrated. The farm income criteria set out in the scheme implement that provision as far as Ireland is concerned. I have no plans to seek EU approval to alter these requirements.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
        <P>A possible role for anaerobic digesters in dealing with organic waste from the both the agricultural and agrifood sector and, in particular, from the pig and poultry sectors has been under consideration by my Department for some time. Some years ago my Department grant aided an anaerobic digestion facility on a pilot project basis with a view to examining its feasibility and potential to process livestock manure. My Department&rsquo;s examination of the issue has continued over recent years in the context of the national climate change strategy, October 2000, and more recently in the context of water pollution and the nitrates action programme. The evaluation of anaerobic digestion to date indicates that while it is a proven technology applicable to the processing of livestock manure, its economic feasibility is dependent on a number of factors including sources of high-energy feedstock for co-digestion, price support for green energy and-or a viable outlet for excess heat produced as an offshoot of electricity production.</P>
        <P>As a stand-alone process, anaerobic digestion has a limited potential for improving water quality as it does not reduce the volume or nutrient content of slurries. To reduce the volume or nutrient content of slurries, anaerobic digestion would need to be combined with some other treatment technology. The removal of water from digestate using reverse osmosis technology has been suggested as a way to address this issue. However, while reverse osmosis is a proven technology for the treatment of water, its suitability for the further processing of digestate has not been fully established.</P>
        <P>An additional factor with implications for the financial viability of anaerobic digestion in Ireland is legislation governing the type of animal-derived wastes that can be digested and spread on land. Ireland&rsquo;s requirements, which are stricter than those laid down by the EU, are designed to ensure the safety of consumers of beef and to prevent the exposure of cattle to the infective BSE agent through feed. The need to prevent the spread of this disease has been of central importance to Ireland since its discovery here in 1989. As a result, high-energy abattoir wastes or other wastes containing meat cannot be anaerobically digested if the resulting digestate has to be spread on any land, which is almost always the case. These restrictions are currently under review in my Department.</P>

        <P>My Department operates a number of schemes which are aimed at developing viable full-time farming.</P>
        <P>Under the installation aid scheme which is operated by my Department, a grant of &euro;9,523 is available to farmers under the age of 35 who are set up for the first time in farming and who meet the education and income criteria set out in the scheme. Preliminary applications, IAS 1 forms, must be received within six months from the date of set up to avoid the application of penalties.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the current scheme of early retirement from farming 2000-2006 facilitates full-time farming through the replacement of older farmers by farmers who are able to improve, where necessary, the economic viability of the remaining agricultural holding.</P>
        <P>Young trained farmers have priority access to up to 25% of the quota available in a co-operative-dairy&rsquo;s milk quota restructuring scheme. Subject to certain conditions, a young trained farmer who wishes to establish a dairy enterprise but holds no milk quota has priority access to purchase milk quota in the milk quota restructuring scheme as a new entrant to dairying or, if he is already a milk producer, has priority access to additional quota as a recent entrant. A young person who is not a producer may, subject to certain conditions, establish a new entrant-parent milk production partnership provided they are already in milk production.</P>
        <P>In addition, any land owner, including a farmer, can avail of 100% grants to afforest land, as well as drawing substantial annual premiums thereafter. Higher rates of premium apply to farmers and are paid for a longer period than for other land owners &mdash; 20 years &mdash; making the option of a combined farm-forestry enterprise very attractive.</P>
        <P>In the event that the herd owner has any further inquiries, they may be addressed to the district veterinary office of my Department, Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo, telephone 094 9035300. The relevant local office of Teagasc will also be equipped to offer appropriate advice to the person concerned.</P>

        <P>Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of, <i>inter alia</i>, Council Directive 2003/50/EC, which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC as regards reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats. These controls, which were introduced in the aftermath of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001, came into effect on 1 July 2004.</P>
        <P>They provide as a minimum requirement that breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export, including a standstill period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding. Slaughter sheep require <Col N="761" />a 21-day residency period and a 21-day standstill period but the standstill period may be derogated from in the case of sheep going directly for slaughter from the holding of origin. In accordance with EU veterinary certification requirements under this directive, all sheep that are exported to another member state must be certified as to their health status by an official veterinarian within 24 hours of departure.</P>
        <P>The foregoing arrangements apply to trade in sheep to and-or from the United Kingdom except that derogations from the residency and standstill arrangements are applied in the case of trade in sheep for slaughter to and from Northern Ireland. The sheep, however, must be inspected and certified for export within 24 hours of export.</P>
        <P>I am advised that specific measures are applied by DARD, Northern Ireland, to monitor movements of sheep from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.</P>

        <P>The control of avian influenza is governed by EU legislation. Council Directive 92/40/EEC requires that all suspected cases of avian influenza must be investigated and appropriate measures taken in case of confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI. To limit the spread, infected poultry must be killed in a humane way and disposed of safely. Feeding stuffs, contaminated equipment and manure must be destroyed or treated to render the virus inactive.</P>
        <Col N="762" />
        <P>Under Article 17 of this Council directive each member state must have a contingency plan specifying the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. Among other things, the plan must provide for access to facilities, equipment, personnel and all other appropriate materials necessary for the rapid and efficient eradication of the outbreak. Ireland&rsquo;s plan also gives details on movement controls and procedures to be followed in the investigation of a suspect premises. Ireland&rsquo;s contingency plan is currently being updated in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. In addition, operational and other aspects are being reviewed and various elements are being updated.</P>
        <P>The EU has also enacted legislation placing an embargo on imports of poultry and certain poultry products from the affected Asian countries &mdash; Commission Decision 2004/122/EC &mdash; and also suspending the import of pet birds from south-east Asia &mdash; Commission Decision 2004/93/EC. Further bans are in place for Canada and the United States.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has also recently tabled proposals on updating the current community measures on avian influenza with a view to improving prevention and control, reducing the health risks, the costs and losses and the negative impact to society of this disease. These proposals are under detailed technical discussion at Council working group in Brussels.</P>

In keeping with the commitment given in the Sustaining Progress agreement, Ireland has already submitted proposals to the European Commission for a derogation from the general limits laid down in the nitrates directive which would allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. These proposals were developed by my Department and Teagasc in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Commission has stated that it will not consider the application for a derogation until Ireland&rsquo;s action programme under the nitrates directive is agreed and in place. A revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, is being finalised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The employment permit application form issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment makes it clear that the issuance of an employment permit in respect of a named non-EEA national does not in itself authorise that person to enter or reside in the State. Decisions on entry to or residence in the State are a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the provisions of section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004. Thus a non-EEA national who is the subject of an <Col N="764" />employment permit may be refused permission to land in the State on a number of stated grounds. For example, failure to be in possession of a valid passport constitutes one such ground.</P>
        <P>Similarly, section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 sets out the circumstances in which a deportation order can be made. These include, for example, circumstances where the person&rsquo;s deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any criminal offence. Possession of an employment permit does not invalidate the application of section 3, although the Minister is under a statutory obligation to consider the employment record and employment prospects of the person in question in determining whether a deportation order should be made.</P>
        <P>Figures are not maintained in such a way as to enable statistics to be gleaned in respect of the number of persons who are the subject of an employment permit who have been refused permission to enter the State or have been deported from the State since the employment permit is one of a number of factors to be taken into account. I can say, however, that the type of case comprehended by the Deputy&rsquo;s question would be extremely rare. In fact, decisions on visa applications in respect of persons who are the subject of employment permits are generally made under delegated sanction at Irish missions abroad without the need to refer them to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

        <P>The refugee in question made an application for family reunification in respect of his wife and children under section 18 of the <Col N="765" />Refugee Act 1996. In support of his application he submitted four passports. Doubts arose as to the authenticity of the passports in question. Subsequent checks by document experts concluded that one of the passports had been fraudulently altered and that there were doubts concerning the authenticity of the other passports. The family reunification application was refused in January 2005. At present the refugee has no current application for family reunification with my Department.</P>
        <P>The passports were forwarded to the Garda national immigration bureau for further investigation. The refugee has now submitted a second set of documents to the Garda and these are being examined.</P>

        <P>Prisoners are not permitted to have mobile phones in their possession either in Mountjoy Prison or in any of the other penal institutions in the State. However, one of the major difficulties in prisons today lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons are viewed as highly valuable commodities among elements of the prison population.</P>
        <P>Huge efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of contraband into Mountjoy Prison. These measures include thorough searching of prisoners returning from court or temporary release, on suspicion, following visits or following committal. Furthermore, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, CCTV monitoring, random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence have all been successful in intercepting significant quantities of contraband in recent years.</P>
        <P>Information regarding individual prisoners&rsquo; temporary release is not shared with the general prison population. However, each individual prisoner will be told the outcome of their applications and have numerous opportunities to relay such information to other prisoners and also to <Col N="766" />members of the public by, for example, their permitted land line telephone calls or during a visit.</P>
        <P>The Garda investigation into this matter is continuing and it would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment on or speculate about the factors individual to this case. I can inform the Deputy, however, that the cell occupied by the victim was searched by the Garda as part of its investigation. While there were no specific phone searches by the prison authorities as a result of this incident, daily searches take place in the prison for such contraband. Furthermore, the victim had not indicated to the prison service authorities that he considered his safety to be at risk.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy was informed in my reply to his parliamentary question of 12 April 2005, applications are not, in general, expedited. Contrary to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion, this application was not an appeal but was a stand-alone application and was dealt with as such.

        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, in the light of the independent role of the director of the Equality Tribunal in investigating or mediating complaints, to comment on any individual case, other than to indicate the following.</P>
        <P>Since October 2000 direct and indirect discrimination in the provision of goods and services is prohibited under the Equal Status Act 2000 on nine grounds, including the grounds of race, which includes colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin. The Act covers all goods and <Col N="767" />services which are available to the public, whether on payment or not. &ldquo;Services&rdquo; are defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment, travel, transport, professional services, education, disposal of premises and provision of accommodation and private registered clubs.</P>
        <P>Under equality legislation, there are two independent bodies with statutory roles: the Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal. The Equality Authority, which has the role of working towards the elimination of discrimination, provides information and advice to any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on any of the grounds covered in the equality legislation, whether in an employment or non-employment area.</P>
        <P>A person who claims that he or she has been discriminated against in the non-employment area may seek redress by referring the case to the Equality Tribunal. The director of the Equality Tribunal has the power under the Equal Status Act to refer the case for mediation or to investigate and decide such a case. If the director finds in favour of the complainant, she may make an order for compensation for the effects of discrimination and-or order a specific course of action to be taken.</P>
        <P>Complaints of discrimination are considered, in the first instance, by the Equality Tribunal. Once a case has been determined by the director, the complainant or respondent involved may appeal against the decision to the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>The Equality Tribunal has neither the power nor the resources to pay expenses to claimants. However, the Equality Authority, at its discretion, may assist a claimant where an important point of principle is at issue or where it would not be reasonable to expect the claimant to present his or her case without assistance.</P>
        <P>The Equality Tribunal is committed to the provision of a timely service and has worked consistently towards the achievement of this goal. With the levelling out of referral numbers following the establishment period and the development of a body of case law under the Acts, considerable improvements have been made. For example, the number of decisions given under the Equal Status Act in 2004 compared with 2003 has increased by 31%.</P>

        <P>While funding applications received to date from County Kildare for assistance under the EOCP amount to &euro;11 million <Col N="768" />approximately, many projects are withdrawn by the project proposers prior to the selection process. Grants totalling almost &euro;6.6 million have been approved including more than &euro;3.1 million in capital grant assistance to nine community-based not-for-profit groups; almost &euro;1 million in staffing grant assistance to five community-based not-for-profit projects; almost &euro;1.4 million in capital grant assistance to 47 private sector child care projects; more than &euro;900,000 to Kildare county childcare committee to enable it to carry out its day-to-day activities and to implement its annual action plans; and almost &euro;200,000 for the support of childminders. It is anticipated that this funding will lead to the creation of more than 1,000 new child care places and will enhance a further 660 existing places. In addition, child care services in County Kildare can benefit from support given to the national voluntary child care organisations to enhance quality awareness.</P>
        <P>In 2004, my Department published a comprehensive review of progress under the equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP, 2000-2006, entitled Developing Childcare In Ireland, which was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and was also posted on the Department&rsquo;s website. Much of the detailed information sought by the Deputy to the end of 2003 is included in this report and this will be updated shortly.</P>

The visa officer will have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin in coming to a decision.

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>Strong provisions are in place to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</P>
        <P>Because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the provisions is the use of temporary closure orders. The Act broadened the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of public order offences, such as supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and the duty on licensees to preserve order on licensed premises.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licenses, late night clubs and food premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that I received Government approval for the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. One thing I have promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly <Col N="771" />into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to note a reduction in assault causing harm in 2004 compared with 2003. This trend has continued in 2005 with a 15% reduction in assaults causing harm in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that in July last year I published the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. That Bill is currently on Second Stage in the House. It provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures that will enhance the powers of the garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In particular, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 29 of the Bill which provides for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to lesser public order offences. This procedure will apply to certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. These are intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.</P>
        <P>It is also my intention to bring forward an amendment to the Bill to provide for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders. I am proposing that garda&iacute; should be able to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order which would prohibit the person from behaving in an anti-social way.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Garda youth diversion projects are funded by my Department. They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project. The projects are a tangible measure of crime prevention and reflect a commitment to multi-agency partnerships in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level. The work of the projects involves linking young people with non-offending peer groups and the forming of stable and trusting relationships with adults in the community. The intended impact of this process is that those so engaged develop into responsible citizens and that they do not progress into the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>I attach great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities on matters affecting policing. My intention, as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, is that joint policing committees and local policing fora will provide an arena where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other issues.</P>
        <P>The Bill specifically provides that among the functions which the committees will be particularly mandated to carry out is keeping under review the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in their area, including the patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs, and the factors underlying and contribu<Col N="772" />ting to those levels of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour. Local policing fora will discuss and make recommendations to their committee concerning these matters as they affect their neighbourhoods. These are significant innovations that will strengthen policing at local level. They will ensure that the new committees and their sub-structures will provide a permanent forum to address the issue of anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned legislation which I have already introduced to combat the abuse of alcohol and the public order problems to which it gives rise. I have recently published the general scheme of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2005, which will carry forward this work. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to streamline and modernise our liquor licensing laws. It will also contain provisions which will combat anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>This Government is strongly committed to the reduction and prevention of crime through strong and effective crime prevention methods. However, I cannot stress enough that while legislative measures can help to curtail the problem of anti-social behaviour, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. All those with an interest in this area have to play their role in helping to address the problems of vandalism and anti-social behaviour in our society.</P>

        <P>The visa application in question was received in my Department on 21 January 2005. The visa application was for the stated purposes of enabling a non-EEA national travel to the State for a four month visit to his brother-in-law in the State. The visa officer who assessed the application sought further information following an initial evaluation of the application by letter dated 3 March 2005.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of further information, the visa was refused as the applicant failed to show that he had obligations to return home following the visit. The visa officer could not be satisfied that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa and the documentation provided regarding finances was insufficient. The decision was sent to the applicant on 8 April 2005.</P>
        <P>It is open to the applicant to appeal the refusal in writing to the Visa Appeals Officer, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, within two months of the notice of issue of the refusal notification.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 377 and 378 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has referred to two applications in his parliamentary question, but has omitted to include application reference numbers. However, my officials believe they have identified the appli<Col N="774" />cations in question. Both applications were received by my Department on 20 May 2005, having been forwarded by the Department of Foreign Affairs the previous day.</P>
        <P>In general, visa applications take on average four to six weeks to process from the date they are received in my Department&rsquo;s visa section. Any application made in an embassy or consular post abroad must, if not falling within the terms of the delegated sanction arrangement, be forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s visa section in Dublin. The time required for an application to reach Dublin from abroad varies considerably from country to country.</P>
        <P>Applications are generally dealt with strictly in date received order. This guarantees the fairest, most transparent service for all our customers. In exceptional cases, where it can be demonstrated that there are extenuating circumstances to be taken into account, applications may be given priority, however based on the information available, it does not appear that any such circumstances exist in this case.</P>

        <P>First, I once again express my sympathy to the family on their tragic loss. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have received representations regarding this matter and I have corresponded directly with the family. The situation remains that this Garda investigation is ongoing and that the Garda authorities have been in regular contact with the family. The issue of requesting a person from outside the Garda Division to review the investigation is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The family concerned, a mother and two sons, arrived in the State in October 2002 and claimed asylum. Their application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and they were notified of this recommendation by letter of 11 June 2003. Their subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and they were notified of this recommendation by letter of 21 October 2003.</P>
        <P>The family was notified of the decision to refuse them refugee status by letter of 21 January 2004 in which they were informed of the three options open to them at that point, that is, to leave the State before their case was considered for deportation; to consent to the making of deportation orders in respect of them; or to make written representations, within 15 working days, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons they should not be deported, that is, why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Representations were made on behalf of the family by the Refugee Legal Service. These were considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 &mdash; prohibition of refoulement. On 28 June 2004 deportation orders were made in respect of the three family members. Notice of these orders was served on them by registered post requiring them to attend at the Garda national immigration bureau on Thursday, 20 January 2005. They attended as required and are due to present again <Col N="776" />on 15 June 2005, when it is expected that travel arrangements will have been put in place.</P>
        <P>As part of the travel arrangements, it was necessary for the Garda national immigration bureau to obtain travel documents from the Turkish Embassy. This required the attendance of the family at the embassy. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the family was brought to the Turkish Embassy where they were interviewed by a consular official in the presence of a member of the Garda national immigration bureau. The interview was described as cordial by the attending garda. This has been confirmed by the Turkish Embassy in an open letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>, published on 25 May.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has further advised that the practice for obtaining travel documents for persons being deported is dictated by the issuing Embassy and this practice varies between embassies. In the case of the Turkish Embassy, it is normal practice for them to request to interview the person or persons concerned to establish their true identity and nationality before issuing travel documents.</P>
        <P>I should point out that, following examination of their asylum and leave to remain applications, the family was found not to be in need of refugee status or other international protection from the Turkish state. The safety of their return to Turkey is, therefore, not an issue.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have been further informed that Garda personnel throughout Garda stations in the Dublin metropolitan region are attached to uniform, detective, task force, special resource, mountain bike, community policing and drugs units. Resources are augmented from within each district-division, as required. For security and operational reasons it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of personnel who will perform duty in any particular area over a specific period.</P>
        <P>As regards Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in this regard in An Agreed Programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Garda stations mentioned will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. Additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to increase significantly the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps.

I understand the policing consists of high visibility patrolling by uniformed garda&iacute;, detective units, the divisional crime task force, the special resource unit, the Garda mountain bike unit, the drugs unit and the community policing unit. I am also informed that current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of public order offences, the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and crimes against property, and the maintenance of an environment conducive to improving quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, operational matters are an issue for the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the local drugs units responsible for the areas mentioned carry out searches on suspects identified as being involved in drug activity and that a number of successful detections and prosecutions have been made. I am further informed that the Ballyfermot Road is patrolled on an ongoing basis by community garda&iacute; and the national drugs unit. The divisional task force also carries out patrols in the area.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; in this area utilise Operation Clean-Street to target drug dealers operating at street level and have had considerable success in this regard.

        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question concerning the Thomas Street-Francis Street-Meath Street areas, I am informed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the policing of these areas is carried out by officers based at Kevin Street station and consists of patrolling by uniformed garda&iacute;, detective units, the divisional crime task force, the special resource unit, the Garda mountain bike unit and the community policing unit. The district drugs unit at Kevin Street station also constantly patrols these areas.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>Judicial reviews of recommendations, determinations or decisions of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are dealt with, as appropriate, by the independent offices involved. Judicial reviews of the Minister&rsquo;s decisions in this area involve mostly challenges to deportation orders, proposals to deport and related matters. My Department has a judicial review unit to deal with these matters. Both the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal have been consulted regarding this question and the following is the position.</P>
        <P>The various offices involved do not keep records of the length of time it takes to have cases determined at either the leave or substantive stages. It is not possible to state an average length of time for the determination of a judicial review <Col N="786" />case. There are so many factors and circumstances which can arise in any case that attempting to calculate an average time would involve a disproportionate amount of time and resources which could not be justified in the context of the more urgent demands on the resources of the various offices involved.</P>
        <P>A small number of cases have been determined within a matter of a month or two of their being filed in the High Court. These were cases where urgent matters were involved, for example, the applicant was in detention or an injunction was sought. On the other hand, there were cases which progressed on appeal to the Supreme Court and where, obviously, significantly more time was involved. While cases are pending before the courts, various matters can arise which might add to or curtail the time involved, for example, requests for discovery, separate applications for residency, settlement negotiations, etc. Progress in these cases is also dependent on the availability of a hearing date. For those reasons, almost every case is unique and it would not be possible to identify a mean average length of time for each stage of the judicial review process without, as I mentioned above, devoting a disproportionate amount of time and resources to the task.</P>

        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports. At this stage, the NCSE has dealt with all new applications from schools for SNA assistance that will be required <Col N="787" />from the beginning of September 2005. Therefore, there should be no reason a child enrolling in a school in September 2005 who needs SNA assistance does not have that assistance in place from his or her first day in school. Where it has been established that additional SNA posts are required, these posts continue to be allocated on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. The average class size in the school in the current year is 27.</P>
        <P>In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and 19 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 534 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has two learning support posts, a resource post and a temporary language support post. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and 18 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 504 pupils at 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year. The closing dates for appeals are 3 June, 24 June and 7 October. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Depart<Col N="788" />ment of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 419 and 425 together.</P>
        <P>The CL&Aacute;R primary school outdoor play facilities enhancement scheme launched in March 2004 is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with joint funding from my Department. This scheme is aimed at improving outdoor play facilities in small rural primary schools in CL&Aacute;R areas. Funding is provided for projects such as provision of tarmacadam for play areas, sporting equipment and other recreational facilities for outdoor areas.</P>
        <P>To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;500,000 towards this jointly funded scheme. <Col N="790" />While there are no plans to expand this scheme to all primary schools, it is open to schools to apply for funding to improve external facilities, including play facilities, under the annual summer works scheme. While I have not had discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the playground scheme, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, launched Ready, Steady, Play: A National Play Policy. Under this scheme, &euro;2 million, in the form of 32 grants, was allocated to local authorities for the provision of playgrounds around the country.</P>
        <P>It is open to all primary schools to use their annual minor works grant for such purposes provided it is not required for more urgent uses. A total of &euro;18.7 million was paid out by my Department to all primary schools under the minor works grant scheme in November 2004. In addition, improvements to play facilities are generally considered within the design brief for building projects at schools. In terms of resources, almost &euro;2 billion has been invested in the period 1998 to 2004 in order to provide modern accommodation, including improvements to play facilities, in schools.</P>

        <P>The most recent professional report indicates that the pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs, SEN, fall within the high incidence disability category. These SEN will therefore be catered for from within the general allocation system of resource teaching support recently communicated to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system. It is a matter for schools to make arrangements to provide teaching support to those pupils who qualify for such support from its general allocation.</P>
        <P>My Department has now issued a letter to all primary schools notifying them of their general allocation and their clustering arrangements, if appropriate. The allocation for the school referred to by the Deputy is 0.4 of a post. My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the end of the current school year.</P>

        <P>Teacher allocations to second level <Col N="792" />schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The school in question applied for a curricular concession allocation and was allocated 7.22 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. The school was notified of this allocation on 10 May 2005 and advised that, in the event of its not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal in writing to the independent appeals committee. To date, the school has not availed of the independent appeals mechanism.</P>
        <P>The total teaching staff allocation to the school for the 2005-06 school year is 61.32 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. Based on a projected enrolment of 790 pupils, this level of allocation leaves the school with an actual pupil teacher ratio of 12.88:1. Additional resources to cater for the needs of Traveller and non-national pupils will be considered by my Department upon application by the school authority. It is also open to the school authority to apply to the National Council for Special Education for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support to cater for the special educational needs of pupils enrolled.</P>
        <P>Regarding teaching staff who wish to retire, a range of options, including the early retirement scheme for teachers and cost neutral early retirement, is available. My Department has received a number of applications for early retirement from teachers in the school concerned and is currently awaiting further information from the school authority on these applications. Full details of retirement options are available by contacting my Department&rsquo;s pensions unit.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 433 together.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule for a particular school year is outlined in a circular which is issued to all primary schools. The circular in respect of the 2005-06 school year was issued recently.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997.</P>
        <P>I recently announced that an additional 660 special needs teaching posts will be put in place from next September to facilitate the implementation of the new general allocation system of resource teaching support. In line with Government policy, the position will be further improved in the future within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</P>

        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
        <P>In the current school year, the staffing of the junior primary school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and 17 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 480 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has a resource teaching post, a special class post and the services of a learning support post based in the school.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and 17 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 497 pupils at 30 September, 2004. In the current school year the staffing of the senior primary school in question comprises of a principal and 16 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 455 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has a resource teaching post, and a learning support post. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and 16 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 454 pupils at 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>The schedule referred to can only be deviated from when a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. In the case of a school with an enrolment of 299 or more pupils, rapid growth is defined as an increase in its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 30 pupils plus a stipulated excess of ten pupils on the appointment figure. If the board of management of the school feels that the enrolment of the school will increase by this amount, it may apply for a post under the developing schools criteria as outlined in Department circular 15/05.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year. The closing dates for appeals are 3 June, 24 June and 7 October. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</P>

        <P>The Giving Children an Even Break scheme introduced in 2001 subsumes the previous process of designation of primary schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department&rsquo;s approach is now refined to ensure that individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre in March-April 2000 at the request of my Department. The criteria considered as part of this survey were those which have been proven to have a high correlation with educational disadvantage, including employment status of pupils&rsquo; parents, medical card possession, and type of housing.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that yesterday I launched a new action plan on educational inclusion. This plan builds on the success of existing programmes while addressing the issues that have diluted the overall effectiveness of some measures. The new plan will be introduced on a phased basis starting in the next school year and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process, which is being conducted on behalf of my Department by the Educational Research Centre, is already under way. Questionnaires have issued to all mainstream primary schools and are due to be returned by close of business today. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group which includes representation from the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals Network.</P>

        <P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in <Col N="800" />areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Some 13 towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving an education.</P>
        <P>I understand that the board is in the process of filling 13 positions arising from the current recruitment process, including one senior educational welfare officer post and 12 educational welfare officer posts. The intention of the board is to have the positions filled prior to the commencement of the next school year. My Department has asked the board to convey details directly to the Deputy of the number of educational welfare officers in each county.</P>

This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
        <P>In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises a principal and eight mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 209 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and seven mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 204 pupils at 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>The schedule referred to above can only be deviated from when a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. In the case of a school with an enrolment of less than 299 pupils, rapid growth is defined as an increase in its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 25 <Col N="806" />pupils plus a stipulated excess of five pupils on the appointment figure. If the board of management of the school feels that the enrolment of the school will increase by this amount, it may apply for a post under the developing schools criteria as outlined in Department circular 15/05.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</P>
        <P>My Department has now completed its review of the general allocation system of resource teaching support. I can confirm that 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to facilitate the implementation of the new general allocation system. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system.</P>
        <P>My Department has now devised school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the general allocation system. These have been notified to schools together with the details of each school&rsquo;s individual allocation. This communication clarifies the position regarding the resource and learning support allocation available to each school. My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the end of the current school year.</P>

        <P>From the next school year, each primary school will be allocated resource teaching hours based on its enrolment figures to cater for the needs of pupils with high-incidence special educational needs, such as dyslexia. Resources for these pupils were previously only considered on an individual application basis supported by psychological assessments. The time-consuming nature of this individual allocation process often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Under the new system, the resource teachers will be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that any child who needs their assistance can get it straight away.</P>
        <P>This model reflects the fact that pupils with high-incidence special needs are distributed throughout the education system while taking into account the differing needs of the most <Col N="808" />disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>Pupils with lower incidence special needs such as autism will continue to be catered for on an individual application basis as these children are not equally distributed throughout the school system. However, the establishment of the National Council for Special Education last January and the recruitment of 71 local special needs organisers throughout the country should greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements are being put in place that involve an interim allocation to certain schools to address the position of pupils with high incidence special education needs, SEN, who had been granted individual resource allocations by my Department under previous staffing allocation systems and who are in schools that would be due to have their staffing allocation in respect of high incidence children reduced if the new system were implemented without alteration. Any such schools with individualised resource allocations in respect of children in the high incidence categories will be allowed to retain the allocation for those pupils until the pupils leave. Schools are required to reduce the transitional allocations as pupils with these individual allocations leave. Schools that are entitled to a transitional allocation have been notified of that allocation by my Department. These transitional arrangements involve the allocation of more than 300 posts on a temporary basis.</P>
        <P>Aside from these transitional arrangements, where a pupil has a high incidence disability or a learning support need, these needs will now be catered for from within the general allocation system. However, the general allocation model does not preclude the provision of support on a one-to-one basis for those children with high incidence special needs or learning support needs who require such intervention.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 457 and 458 together.</P>
        <P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children in schools is a key concern for me, parents, schools and society generally. The central vetting unit run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for vetting requests with regard to prospective employees of designated agencies with substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The designated agencies comprise more than 900 organisations. In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of requests for clearance from my Department with regard to bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children with special educational needs and to staff working in children detention schools.</P>
        <P>A cross-governmental working group, established to put forward proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit, has recommended the expansion of its services to include all people working with children and vulnerable adults. To <Col N="810" />this end, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a major increase in the resources to be provided to the Garda vetting unit to improve the level of vetting available to employers who employ people to work with children and vulnerable adults. The initiative includes more than doubling staff resources for the unit.</P>
        <P>Employment of school staff is primarily a matter for the boards of management of schools who have a statutory responsibility in this regard. School authorities have a duty of care to their pupils and normal practice is to insist on letters of reference from previous employers before offering a position. In addition, Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 obliges convicted sex offenders, which includes persons convicted abroad as well as in this jurisdiction, and before as well as after the commencement of the Act when seeking or accepting employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children to inform their prospective employer of the fact of the conviction. Failure to do so is a criminal offence.</P>

        <P>Statutory protection of architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities to which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provides advice in the exercise of their functions in that regard under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Under the provisions of that Act, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. That may be done when a development plan is being prepared or at any other time, where appropriate. The 2000 Act places a duty of care on owners of protected structures and gives planning authorities enhanced powers not only to deal with development proposals which affect them but also to safeguard their future.</P>

The directives deal with public access to environmental information, Directive 2003/4/EC, and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures, Directive 2003/35/EC. The ratification of the convention will take place after the directives have been transposed into Irish law. Work is continuing in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this regard.

        <P>The EU habitats directive requires member states to propose areas for designation as special areas of conservation to conserve the habitat types listed on Annex I of the directive and the animal and plant species listed on Annex II of the directive. In selecting suitable sites, member states are required to use the scientific criteria set out in Annex III of the directive.</P>
        <P>The directive does not specify a percentage of land to be designated but it requires member states to designate special areas of conservation for habitats and species on Annexes I and II which occur in their territories. In Ireland, this has led to the designation of special areas of conservation for 60 habitat types and 25 animal or plant species. Some 420 candidate special areas of conservation have been publicly notified. Most of the areas have now been formally transmitted by Ireland to the European Commission and adopted as part of a European list. They cover approximately 10.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s land and freshwater area. The figure of 14% is arrived at when marine areas covered by special areas of conservation designations are included and expressed as a percentage of the land and freshwater area.</P>
        <Col N="814" />
        <P>Approximately one third of the total area of Ireland&rsquo;s proposed special areas of conservation is in counties Galway and Mayo. The extent of designations in the counties reflects their higher than average proportion of the habitat types and habitats of species warranting designation. Important habitat types well represented in counties Mayo and Galway include raised and blanket bogs, heaths, turloughs, sand dunes and machair, as well as rivers and estuaries containing Annex ll species.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
        <P>From the commencement of the single mandate for elective local government, local authorities were required <Col N="815" />to make specific arrangements to provide a reasonable level of service for Members of the Oireachtas and to facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities. The statutory regulations which have been made in this regard have been in operation since 1 August 2003. Copies of the regulations, known as the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003, are available in the Oireachtas Library, along with an information note.</P>
        <P>The regulations, which apply to all local authorities, provide <i>inter alia</i> for the supply by the local authority of specified documentation, such as the local authority budget and the draft development plan, to Members of the Oireachtas. Equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes to those used in respect of correspondence from members of local authorities also apply in respect of Members of the Oireachtas. Managers are required to meet local Members of the Oireachtas at least once a year and thus provide an opportunity for an update on developments and for any difficulties encountered to be raised and addressed. That is in addition to normal and regular contact between public representatives and local authority officials about particular problems or issues.</P>
        <P>Apart from the regulations in this area, I expect that issues relating to the operation of the arrangements will be resolved as local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas become more familiar with the process. I intend to contact local authorities this year to obtain information on the practical application of the scheme to date. Arising from this, I will issue supplementary guidance to local authorities, if necessary. I am concerned that local authorities should at all times facilitate parliamentary representatives, in both the spirit and the letter of the regulations, by providing local authority documentation in a timely manner.</P>

        <P>Many local authorities provide community facilities, including child care facilities, in association with the construction of new social housing. Such facilities <Col N="819" />are usually funded by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as part of the capital cost of the project. The ongoing management and operational costs of such facilities are matters for local authorities.</P>
        <P>Local authorities also have a role in ensuring that the planning process supports the provision of adequate child care facilities. Guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities were issued by the Department in July 2001. The guidelines advise local authorities on including specific child care objectives in local development plans and on assessing development proposals for child care facilities. Local authorities were advised that it is appropriate to provide for one child care facility, with a minimum of 20 child care places, for every 75 dwellings in new housing areas. This helps to promote a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities. The question of what further role local authorities can play in this area will be kept under review in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall child care policies.</P>

        <P>The loans in question, which were issued by local authorities before the intro<Col N="820" />duction of variable rates in December 1987, reflect the long-term costs of the funds prevailing when the loans were advanced. Rates were fixed for the life of the loan. The subsequent introduction of variable interest rates for local authority mortgages has given borrowers increased flexibility and choice.</P>
        <P>Borrowers with fixed rate local authority repayments are permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties of up to six months&rsquo; interest or more applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages. In 2001, the position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in consultation with the Department of Finance. The review determined that a State subsidy to reduce such interest rates would not be appropriate.</P>

        <P>The EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings, Directive 2001/91/EC, will be legally transposed by 4 January 2006, as required under Article 15(1) of the directive. However, Article 15(2) of the directive provides for a longer period, up to 4 January 2009, for the practical implementation of more complex provisions regarding mandatory energy performance rating or labelling of newly constructed buildings and existing buildings when existing buildings are sold or let; the improvement of the energy efficiency of boilers; and the mandatory inspection of air conditioning systems. The longer implementation period is needed to allow qualified or accredited experts for certification and inspection work to be trained, as required by article 10.</P>
        <P>The draft action plan for the implementation of the directive in Ireland was published on 27 April 2005 by Sustainable Energy Ireland, on behalf of an interdepartmental working group comprising senior officials from the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and Sustainable Energy Ireland. A copy of the draft action plan is available in the Oireachtas Library. The draft plan provides for the phased implementation of building energy rating certification between 2007 and 2009.</P>
        <Col N="821" />
        <P>I issued a press statement welcoming the publication of the draft action plan and pointing out that the public have three months, ending on 29 July 2005, to submit comments on the draft to Sustainable Energy Ireland. I expressed the hope that this opportunity will be availed of by a wide cross section of the public, including people involved in the construction industry and the auctioneering and legal professions. The definitive implementation plan will be drawn up following careful consideration of all the submissions received during the consultation process.</P>

        <P>It is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the allocation of houses to various categories of needs on their waiting lists in accordance with their schemes of letting priorities. The making of a scheme of letting priorities by local authorities is a reserved function in accordance with section 11 of the Housing Act 1988. Guidelines were issued to local authorities in 1989 on the preparation of schemes of letting priorities. The guidelines indicate that it should be the aim of a scheme of letting priorities to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs to ensure that a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of needy persons is at a permanent disadvantage when compared with other categories.</P>

        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issues an annual licence under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, to the Irish Coursing Club allowing affiliated clubs to net hares. According to the club, which is required to give details of the number of hares netted on foot of the licences, the number of hares netted in the 2001-02 season was 6,005, the number of hares netted in the 2002-03 season was 5,877, the number of hares netted in the 2003-04 season was 5,751 and the number of hares netted in the 2004-05 season was 5,929. The Irish Coursing Club is also required, as a condition of the licence, to make returns of the numbers of hares released back into the wild. Some 97% of the hares netted in the years in question were released back into the wild.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 400 of 24 May 2005. Noise pollution is a cause for concern under the Euro<Col N="823" />pean Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations if the special area of conservation in question is designated as such to protect species which are adversely affected by noise. That is not the case, however, in the site referred to in the question.</P>
        <P>Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 gives local authorities powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise generally. Section 108 of the Act pro<Col N="824" />vides that a local authority, the Environmental Protection Agency or any person may complain to the District Court about noise which is giving reasonable cause for annoyance. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to people experiencing noise nuisance is available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
