      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The e-inclusion fund was established to support the participation of late adopters of technology in an inclusive information society. The Government allocated &euro;1.025 million for the funding of e-inclusion initiatives in 2005, which includes particular focus on initiatives targeted primarily at older people and people with disabilities. Based on CSO statistics, these groups have been identified as two of the most vulnerable sectors in society.</P>
        <P>A total of 117 applications were received following a national call for proposals under the e-inclusion fund. Some 49 projects were subsequently approved for funding by the e-inclusion sub-group of the assistant secretaries implementation group. The Deputy may be aware of the <Col N="2"/><i>assistireland.ie</i> website which was developed by Comhairle. This is an assistive technology website which provides details of products that are aimed at providing older people and people with disabilities with assistance in independent living.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response. How many older people and people with disabilities benefited from the 49 projects mentioned by the Minister of State? Does he agree that a lack of information and access to information through technology is a barrier to older people in accessing benefits and entitlements? What further plans does the Government have to expand the service for older people in particular, who may often be isolated in their own homes? Does the Minister of State agree that access to the Internet and e-mail would be a great advantage to older people in combating social exclusion? How does the Government plan to assist older people and people with disabilities to learn how to use computers, the Internet and e-mail?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of projects involved is 117. They are good projects which were assessed independently by the e-inclusion sub-group. The <Col N="3"/>funding provides assistance to the groups to ensure that people become more aware of the importance of technology. The Deputy is correct that this is vital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Minister of State, I have identified two groups needing attention, the elderly who would be greatly assisted in combating loneliness and isolation, and people with disabilities, for whom tremendous work has been done. Much good work is also being done by information technology companies. Enable Ireland and Assist Ireland are involved with projects focused on the elderly and people with disabilities. I assure the Deputy that we are considering the funding for next year &mdash; I understand it will be &euro;1.5 million. We will continue to focus on those who do not have access to technology. A third group targeted for inclusion are people from disadvantaged areas. A project we announced recently related to disadvantaged areas, where good work is being done and where working with schools is important.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked what more we could do. In addition to the funding for inclusion, there is also the information society fund from which funding was provided for the &ldquo;About the House&rdquo; television programme to highlight the benefits of ICT in the home and to the lives of householders. One of the challenges for older people is overcoming the fear of technology. The programme aimed to demystify and encourage the use of technology by illustrating its benefits, ease of installation and accessibility. One of the programmes showed how putting technology in place can compensate for lack of mobility at home so that older people can maintain their quality of life, independence, social communication, security and peace of mind for themselves and their families. We have moved on from the technology itself and the key issue is what use the technology can be put to. It can have tremendous utility, particularly for older people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that every older person in the State who wants access to technology has it? Is he satisfied that people know of the benefits of e-mail and computers? The Minister referred to 49 projects. How many people were involved in those projects, what did the projects involve and where were they located? What initiatives is the Government putting in place to install this technology in the homes of older people, especially in isolated rural areas where social interaction and contact can be at a minimum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The precise number of people involved is difficult to know but I will make every effort to obtain that information by having my officials check the list of successful applicants. To give an idea of the type of groups involved, the lengthy list includes Ability Enterprise, Clare<Col N="4"/>morris; Active Virginian Club, Cavan; Age and Opportunity; UCD Equality Studies Centre; An Cosan, Tallaght; and the Ballyhaunis Family Resource Centre. Many people are involved in the 170 organisations, which include groups dealing with the elderly and people with disabilities. Apart from that, tremendous work is being done by Mo Bhaile, a pilot project conducted by seven local authorities. I was fortunate to visit South Dublin County Council, where various community groups can access the Mo Bhaile facility, to see at first hand the work the group is doing there. I have first-hand knowledge of many retirement groups accessing that facility. There is significant work to be done and my objective as Minister of State with responsibility for the information society is to ensure that those in danger of missing the opportunity to participate in the knowledge society are included.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that this is a knowledge society. We are creating an island of ingenuity and want to involve those who have not had a chance to become familiar with, or are mystified by, technology.</P>
        <P>The focus now is on how to make the ingenuity of people gel with the technology. Young people understand that kind of language and adapt to technology. I agree with the Deputy, however, that we need to focus on several areas. That is the objective of this e-inclusion fund. The fund is modest but will rise to &euro;1.5 million next year and there are many other areas on which we can concentrate our efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 117 projects were announced under the e-inclusion fund but is the Minister of State aware that vocational education committees run many adult education courses? The cost of paying extra fees to these teachers has been passed directly to the people attending the courses, including senior citizens. The age limit for defining a senior citizen has been increased by ten years making it significantly more expensive for people over the age of 50 to do any course.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science has refused point blank to provide any funding to compensate for the increased cost of these courses. Is the Minister of State amenable to providing some money from his fund to make up the teacher costs of any information technology related course run by the VECs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>These projects are independently assessed. The organisations involved are community-based, bottom-up groups, such as the South Tipperary Community and Voluntary Forum, the Summerhill Active Retirement Group, and the Tipperary Uplands IT Group. It is encouraging to see the Walkinstown Association. This came from an advertisement placed by my Department, making it a transparent process.</P><Col N="5"/>
        <P>I will be glad to pursue the issues the Deputy raised regarding the VEC. I cannot make any commitment, however, because I want to ensure this work is community-based. Deputy Stanton pointed to the need to reach as many individuals as possible through various associations and organisations. I will be happy to pursue that with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State aware of some of the initiatives taken by the VECs to roll out access for senior citizens to IT introduction and training courses? Is he proactively pursuing new ideas and ways of delivering IT information and familiarisation to rural and remote regions where there is great difficulty with communications?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned an area in County Cavan, but does he know that in west Cavan the VEC provides computer training designed to develop skills in a socially and economically deprived part of the country? Will the Department examine how this example is applied? Does the Minister of State view a direct engagement with senior citizens, clubs and groups as worthwhile? Such an engagement would allow an exploration of how outreach activities and the introduction to information technology could be brought to people, particularly our senior citizens and people with disabilities, in more rural and remote locations, rather than them having to attend centres of learning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am aware of the work of the VECs in this area. I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s analysis on the importance of it and they must be encouraged in what they are doing. I will pursue the issues raised by Deputy Gogarty.</P>
        <P>On the involvement of elderly people, we see examples time and again of what is happening. In the Dublin South constituency, I have seen many examples of such projects which are encouraging. It is obvious to me that when older people become familiar with and use information technology, it can be of huge benefit, not just to them, but to their colleagues and friends. It is a fantastic means of communication. I welcome any ideas Members may have to encourage this.</P>
        <P>I will ask my officials to circulate the list of successful applicants to Members as it contains good examples of projects in communities. In particular, we must access those in rural areas because information technology connects people. While I accept some people will decline to use it, at least they should be given the opportunity of exploring it. The best way to do this is through community groups. In many rural areas, there are some active community groups. If we can get the older people in communities to access these organisations and bodies, there is every chance that it will have a positive impact on their lives. I agree with the Deputy on that point.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has pointed out that he is concerned by the lack of volunteers in communities. If the Minister of State is depending on active community groups to push this project, what happens in locations where there are no such groups? What plans has the Minister of State to introduce information technology in these areas? Has the Minister of State set any targets to be achieved in this area? If he has, will he share them with the House? Has the Minister of State any plans to make it easier for older people to purchase computers for their homes? As they can be quite expensive, it can act as a barrier to older people accessing information technology and the Internet. Are there any plans to extend the existing seven Mo Bhaile projects to other local authorities? If so, which ones and how soon will they be included?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a strong supporter, along with the Taoiseach, of promoting voluntarism. In my time involved in overseas development when Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, I promoted the concept of voluntarism. We can do it at home and abroad. I am delighted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, along with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has moved swiftly on this issue. We can do much to promote voluntarism at local and national level.</P>
        <P>The Mo Bhaile project is involved in seven local authorities, South County Dublin, Mayo, Meath, Westmeath, north Tipperary and south Tipperary. The information society fund is involved in financially supporting these projects. It is a pilot project aimed at building the information and communications technology of the community and voluntary sector, targeted at working from the bottom up. Community champions have been employed to encourage engagement with information and communications technology and create a shared sense of purpose in information society development. There are more than 300 community groups on-line in the pilot areas. This is the best way to proceed. I have not set specific targets but we must keep going to achieve maximum reach and connectivity with communities.</P>
        <P>The Mo Bhaile projects also focus on promoting awareness, that is, conveying to those who may not otherwise appreciate it the reason the Internet is relevant and how it can benefit them. Having spoken to older people who have started to use technology in recent times, I am convinced of the necessity of the Mo Bhaile initiative and will continue to promote it in any way I can. Government funding must be allocated to the most appropriate areas, one of which is the Mo Bhaile project.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State have plans to extend the Mo Bhaile initiative to the rest of the country? When will the pilot project conclude? Does he agree that the cost of computers is prohibitive? Does he have plans to make it easier for older people to purchase computers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The best approach to facilitating the purchase of computers is to try to support local communities and identify how we can help them and representative organisations. I have spoken positively about the Mo Bhaile project and favour its extension. I will get back to the Deputy with information on the latest position.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The figures in the table exclude all fares received by Irish carriers. The table shows a total of &euro;3.2 billion spent by overseas visitors in 2004, an increase of 22.4% on the figure of &euro;2.6 billion in 2000. Over the same period the consumer price index increased by 16%. The all-items consumer price index is the official measure of inflation for Ireland. Based on changes in the CPI, the annual average increase was 16% between 2000 and 2004.</P>
        <P>A separate analysis of travel to Ireland by &ldquo;lower&rdquo; or &ldquo;higher&rdquo; international fares and the resulting visitor expenditure is not possible. The figures given for each route exclude fares. A separate estimate of fares received by Irish carriers is given in Table 1 of the CSO annual release on tourism and travel. It is expected that tourism and travel estimates for the year 2005 will be published in spring 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State acknowledge that irrespective of whether one calculates the figures using the consumer price index or, as I did, by making a rough estimate of the inflation rate in a given year, the result will show that tourism expenditure has not increased over the rate of inflation? Does he agree that this raises serious questions, particularly given the threat posed by the Baltic and Scandinavian states which are successfully developing eco-tourism? Given that the number of walking holidays has decreased every year since the start of the millennium, Comhairle na Tuaithe is having no success in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is here to answer questions on statistics. He has no responsibility for policy issues in tourism, which are a matter for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State, on behalf of the Taoiseach, acknowledge that expenditure by tourists has not increased, primarily due to a decline in the number of walking holidays, and that action is needed on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>While I greatly value the work of the CSO, it is always helpful to have more statistics. As the Deputy will be aware, the CSO compiles monthly figures on overseas travel and carries out quarterly and annual surveys on tourism and travel. The monthly figures cover total travel to Ireland. The Deputy is correct that the figures include a range of categories of visitors, including those who come here to work and those who come for a walking holiday. Through every phase one gets more detailed information. The quarterly survey contains country of residence information as well as the passenger card inquiry. The latter provides much more detail as to why people are coming here and where they are going. As I have said before, however, we need much more information, which would be of great help to us. That information is being sought and I am in constant touch with the Central Statistics Office regarding that.</P>
        <P>I gave the Deputy the facts concerning the increase in expenditure from 2000, in accordance with the question, which was &euro;2.6 billion on all <Col N="9"/>overseas routes. It has risen to &euro;3.2 billion, which represents a rise of 22.4%. I also referred to the consumer price index increase. The annual figures for 2005 will be available next spring, which is the way it is done because it is detailed work. The most recent figures for visitor numbers are those for September 2005, which were published on 23 November. They show that the number of trips to Ireland increased by almost 53,000 on the same month in 2004. That is an increase of<?oasys _jy?>8.9%, so the figures are looking good. I accept what the Deputy said in that some detailed work remains to be done on the precise reasons people come and where they are travelling within the country. We could do some work on a regional basis as well and I am pursuing that with the CSO.</P>

	<P>Is there a breakdown in the Minister&rsquo;s statistics of visitors by age? Are visitors from the North of Ireland classified as so-called foreign visitors or is it recognised that they are part of the island approach to tourism? The Minister and I have spoken about this approach in previous exchanges regarding these statistical questions. If statistics on visitors&rsquo; ages are available, and specifically concerning the North of Ireland, is this information feeding into the case for the roll-out of the yet to be delivered all-Ireland free travel pass for senior citizens, including pensioners?</P>

Those are the figures we have and the Deputy can obviously access them on our website under the heading of tourism and travel 2004. They were published on 26 April 2005.

        <P>The Deputy asked about North-South co-operation, which was also raised in a previous question. I have asked my officials about the matter and there is a considerable amount of co-operation between North and South in compiling these figures. CSO officials met their Northern Ireland counterparts in the Statistical and Research Agency and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. While there is good interaction between our agencies and theirs in this area, we need to do much more work in this regard. As I have already said, when the institutions are hopefully back up and running, tourism is an obvious area where it would be most helpful to have an island of Ireland approach. I know our tourism agencies would welcome that approach in order to work together on compiling data. Alongside this work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland does a great deal of work on a regional basis. Many Deputies from various political parties have asked for more work to be undertaken <Col N="10"/>in this respect, and I am pursuing that matter with the CSO.</P>

	<P>Would the Minister of State accept that, in light of the statistics he has indicated to the House in respect of spending in Ireland by visitors from overseas and, particularly, the North, in the event of the roll out of the free travel pass and given the significant spending power that visitors in the sterling area of the island would have in coming here, there would be a large advance in these figures on previous years?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions. The first relates to the cross-Border issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. Is there any way, even anecdotally, of devising some form of analysis of the cross-Border figures to show how many people from overseas access the Republic via Northern Ireland as opposed to the many people resident there? They are different demographics and it would be interesting to view those statistics were there some way of doing so.</P>
        <P>Staying on statistics, the Minister of State mentioned the quarterly figures which highlight the number of nights stayed by people residing temporarily in the country. These have been declining over a period. In this context and without prejudice to F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s work but recognising the sterling work done by the Central Statistics Office, its professionalism and capability in this regard, would it be possible to use the CSO to take a sample of customer satisfaction levels when people enter or exit the country and examine such issues as cost and customer services? These types of figures should be taken together statistically rather than waiting for annual reports from F&aacute;ilte Ireland which examines them in a different context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The more information we have the better. It would help all of us at Government and tourism organisational levels in planning. My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, has a keen interest in this area. As Deputy Gogarty said, the agencies under his Ministry are doing much work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that in other countries, departments and ministries work with hotels, for example, and much information is provided at that level. There are many other ways to compile information and we should examine every avenue. To be fair to the CSO, it has made signifi<Col N="11"/>cant recent advances. I have met the agency&rsquo;s personnel a number of times to discuss the type of work it does. We should encourage it to continue getting more detailed information.</P>
        <P>There is co-operation with the Northern Ireland institutions and organisations and information compiled at Belfast Airport and Northern ports would be shared with us. Returning to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s point, much more work could be done in this area. I thank the Deputies for their comments, which will be noted by the CSO, a point I always make. It listens to what Deputies say and will follow up on the matters.</P>

	<P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14-?>Does the Minister of State share the views of his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, who has discouraged senior citizens from coming here to live or visit by saying this is a very expensive country? Was the Minister speaking on behalf of the Government or was he speaking off his own bat? His comment appeared in newspapers, which does not give a good image to senior citizens who wish to return to live here or visit.

	<P>I share his views. I am sure he said this is a country that welcomes back our people who went abroad. The figures show that many have returned. Returning to the earlier question and discussion on information technology and older people, we must make every effort for those members of our society who made a significant input to the building of this economy, which we should never forget. They have a special place in our society when it comes to any Government initiatives. A reference was made to voluntarism. Any initiatives from Government or at State agency level which are focused on the elderly whether those at home or abroad, are worthy of promotion. I am glad my colleague has alluded to this.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>his plans for the future funding of local government; when the Indecon report on local government finance will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36986/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The new arrangements for financing local government, based around the local government fund which the Government introduced in 1999 have had a major positive effect on the finances of local authorities. The fund provides a buoyant and dedicated source of funding for local authorities to supplement the income they derive from other specific Government grants and from local sources such as commercial rates and charges for services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A measure of the success of the new arrangements can be gauged from the general purpose grant allocations from the fund in 2005, which amount to some &euro;817 million. These allocations are significantly greater than the equivalent figure in 1995 which was &euro;240 million and the 1997 amount of &euro;339 million. The 2005 allocation represents an increase of 8.7% over 2004 and an increase of 140% over 1997 allocations. In the case of the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency, for example, the allocations for Galway County Council have increased from &euro;9.9 million in 1994 to &euro;13 million in 1997 and to &euro;32.6 million in 2005. This is an increase of almost 330% over the figure in 1994 when the Deputy opposite had more influence with the Minister of the day. I have therefore been kinder to Galway than he was.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of grant aid for non-national roads, which since 1999 receive funding from the local government fund, has also increased very significantly over recent years with 2005 allocations totalling &euro;495 million compared to &euro;139 million in 1994 and &euro;225 million in 1997.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recently published Abridged Estimates Volume provides for an Exchequer contribution to the fund of &euro;518.575 million in 2006 which is a 6% increase over 2005 levels. Taken together with motor tax buoyancy, I am confident the general purpose grants which I will shortly notify <Col N="13"/>to local authorities for 2006 will again make a significant contribution to meeting the increased costs of local authorities in the year ahead.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>This will enable them to provide a reasonable level of services without the need for any undue increases in commercial rates, fees and other charges.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the success of the changes introduced in 1999, my predecessor commissioned a review of the funding of local government in light of developments in the economy and the evolving challenges facing the sector into the future. The main elements of the review, undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants in association with the Institute of Local Government Studies, were to project the income and expenditure of local authorities over the short and medium term, evaluate the existing method of funding the sector, examine potential alternative funding systems and identify the scope for efficiencies in the sector.</P>
        <P>I received the Indecon report recently, and am currently considering its wide-ranging analysis and recommendations. I intend to bring the report to the attention of my colleagues in Government within the coming weeks and to publish it very shortly thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the information, most of which I did not seek. Will the Minister concede that this almost mythical report has been in construction for far too long and that he is using the delay as a comfort blanket? Does he agree the absence of the report is being used as an excuse for inaction? Does the Minister also agree that rather than wasting time and waiting for Indecon to come up with the goods, he would be better arguing more forcibly for a better slice of Exchequer funds for his Department, considering Exchequer funds are &euro;1.5 billion more than the Government anticipated? Does the Minister not realise that local authorities are under-funded? Does he realise that a 6% rise in local government funding will not be enough to help councils meet all their commitments? Will the Minister inform the House how much money was collected nationally in development charges in 2004? Does he support the imposition of development charges of up to &euro;7,000, &euro;8,000 and even &euro;10,000, on people trying to build their houses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer to those three supplementary questions. I do not agree with the Deputy that there has been anything improper or delayed about the publication of the Indecon report. The Deputy&rsquo;s fourth point was whether another report was needed. That is a good question and it could be the subject for a debate.</P><Col N="14"/>
        <P>On the issue of the publication of the Indecon report, lest anybody thinks I am delaying it, I sought what was the precedent and I am following precisely the same arrangements as applied with the KPMG report in 1996, when the rainbow coalition was in Government.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the question about local government and development levies because colleagues from Deputy McCormack&rsquo;s party in my county recently very significantly increased the development levies over what they had promised to people before the local elections, but that is a different issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The general point about the levies on which the Deputy touched was how much money is collected and how much money is in the kitty. That is a good question. I have already indicated that this year, before the councillors get into their estimates, I expect them to have those figures. There is a suggestion that there is approximately &euro;400 million in levies collected and in accounts in the local authorities around the country. It is my view &mdash; I am sure it is Deputy McCormack&rsquo;s view &mdash; that whatever that figure, it should be available to councillors before they get into the estimates process. The lack of transparency in this area is not healthy and that is the point Deputy McCormack is making. I agree with him. I have suggested that this year that figure should be available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister acknowledge that in November 1992 he told Wicklow County Council that he would oppose the development levies of up to &euro;7,500 in addition to other charges and that during the council the Minister pointed out that if any Minister for Finance attempted to introduce a tax imposition of up to &euro;7,500 on new houses, he would not last long?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputy obviously knows the answers as well as the questions.</P>

	<P>Could the Minister state whether he will introduce property tax?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the Deputy should read in depth what I stated.</P>

	<P>I read it.</P>

	<P>No, he clearly did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I did and if I had time, I would quote it all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy knows the answers as well as the questions, it is pointless coming in here asking questions. If he wants to hear the answers, what he should do is let me answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister changes his mind so often I do not know what the answer is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should hold on a second, that is r&aacute;im&eacute;is. Deputy McCormack knows as well as I know that since planning and development was a reality in this country there have been development charges. What I do not agree with is excessive development charges. What I do not agree with is councillors cutting &mdash; as Deputy McCormack&rsquo;s colleagues in Wicklow did last year before the local elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McCormack has colleagues in the Wicklow council. Before the Fine Gael members on the council went before the people of Wicklow, they made a big brouhaha of reducing the charges and last week they increased them. That is a local issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to Deputy McCormack&rsquo;s question is development charges are part and parcel of all this, and what I do not agree with is the kind of gouging out that has happened, particularly in one-off housing because of the activities of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment of housing need is statutorily required to be carried out every three years. The last full assessment was commenced by local authorities in early 2005 on the basis of detailed guidance provided by the Department.</P>
        <P>A number of important new elements were introduced for the 2005 assessment. In particular, a computer based system was established to receive and analyse the data; and individual PPS numbers have been collected for all applicants. This will prevent multiple counting of the same applicant in the census of need, without prejudice to the continued right of persons to seek housing in different local authority areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Assessments were initiated by local authorities contacting all existing applicants on their waiting lists and making it known locally, usually through the media, that an assessment of housing need was being undertaken. Local authorities were required to contact any health board operating in <Col N="17"/>or adjoining their area. In addition they will have contacted voluntary and non-profit making organisations engaged locally in the provision of housing accommodation and other such bodies.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for individual authorities to determine whether persons comply with the statutory requirements to be accepted for inclusion in the assessments under section 9 of the Housing Act 1988 and section 6 of the Housing Act 1998. An authority may, to assist it in arriving at a decision, have regard to reports from health boards and other agencies or authorities. Section 9 provides that persons may be included in an assessment only where they are in need of accommodation, unable to provide it from their own resources and require long-term accommodation from the authority. I expect to publish detailed tables, including a breakdown of categories of need, in respect of all local authorities in the next few weeks.</P>

	<P>This is an insulting answer to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. This is a matter of simple addition. Any of the children in the Visitors Gallery would have done it long ago.

	<P>There are only 40 housing authorities or thereabouts. It is not a difficult sum. What is the total number of applicants? The Minister of State should not take us for fools. He has that information and he is withholding it from the House. Give the House the information. I have asked the Minister of State for the number of applicants for local authority and other forms of social housing and the gross total. He should spit it out and tell the House what he knows.</P>

	<P>I know what the Deputy has asked and I would like to facilitate him and give an accurate figure, but I cannot. While the assessments started last spring, it was September before some of the first figures were received from local authorities. Much work has been done since then with very detailed cross checking to ensure consistency of approach. That is one of the matters <Col N="19"/>we are trying to achieve. At this stage we are fairly close to the final figure and I hope to have it out to the Deputy within the next few weeks.</P>

        <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that manufacturers or distributors are making an adequate financial contribution to the recycling of consumer packaging, in view of the fact that domestic waste charges continue to rise.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36759/05]</QRef><Col N="20"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ireland has enjoyed considerable success in recent years in meeting targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency show that we met the 25% target for 2001 set under the packaging waste directive and that we are on course to meet the 50% recovery target for 2005. The comparable figure for 1998 was approximately 14%. The practical implementation of the packaging directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited, which is working successfully. Under this scheme, Repak subsidises the collection and recycling of both commercial and domestic packaging waste. There has also been a significant acceleration in our recycling performance in other waste streams, such as electrical and electronic equipment, construction and demolition waste. This is being made possible by the rolling out of the necessary infrastructure in terms of recycling facilities. In recent years we have doubled the number of bring banks and civic amenity sites.</P>
        <P>Building on our success in the area of packaging waste recycling, I established the national strategy group on packaging waste recycling in October 2004, involving the key public and private stakeholders such as Repak, IBEC, producers, waste collectors, reprocessors, local authorities and my Department. The group is mandated to develop a strategy for achieving the 2011 targets under an amended packaging waste directive, which will require an overall recovery rate of 60%.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the level of subsidy for waste collection services has been raised as an issue by certain local authorities in the context of the revision of their waste management plans. The strategy group is the appropriate forum in which to find consensus between all of the stakeholders on the best way to address all of the issues, including the appropriate levels of financial support from producers for the recovery and recycling activities of the local authorities. The partnership approach is the appropriate way to make further progress in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister seems to claim that everything is fine. It reminds me of Saddam Hussein claiming to be still the president of Iraq. Ireland is at the bottom of the league when compared with other countries in Europe. One need look no further than the European Environment Agency&rsquo;s report which was launched today. The report suggests that of the 32 countries surveyed, Ireland gets the D minus in the environment league.</P>
        <P>At the moment, manufactures and distributors contribute to recycling through Repak, which recycles packaging waste. However, Repak is<?oasys _jy?><Col N="21"/><?oasys _fc?>only paying for the crumbs of recycling. In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, householders that get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am leading up to it, if I could be so bold. In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, householders now have the green bin, but they are paying for the privilege. If they want the green bin, they pay &euro;100 per annum for it. The cost of recycling the content of these bins is &euro;6 million per annum, yet Repak only pays &euro;250,000. Not everything in the green bin is recyclable, but surely Repak or the manufacturers and distributors should make a far greater contribution to recycling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I was in the middle of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has gone over his allotted time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief. Surely the householders should not pay the vast bulk of the financial contribution to recycling. Can we ask Repak to pay more? If Repak is not prepared to pay more, can the manufacturers and distributors pay their fair share of the recycling burden?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Between 2000 and 2005, Repak spent &euro;66 million on direct recycling costs. In that period, Ireland has consistently achieved the EU packaging waste recycling targets. The Deputy was very selective in his reference to the EU and to the EPA. If I was sitting over there, I would probably be equally selective, so I will not fault him for that. Repak expenditure on direct recycling activity has amounted to approximately &euro;12.4 million. From time to time it is necessary to review the balance between the different parties in the amounts they recycle. This has worked very well as a partnership arrangement and it will be examined by the strategy group. We have seen success out of partnership arrangements elsewhere. I referred to the electrical and electronic waste and the initial figures for these are quite astonishing. When I get final figures, I will make them available to the House.</P>
        <P>We are making good progress in this area. The partnership approach is working and the specific point raised by the Deputy should be discussed by the strategy group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the mathematics are done on this, it is apparent that the householder is paying &euro;80 to &euro;100 per annum and that Repak pays around 5% of that. That seems like a disproportionate balance in favour of the manufacturing industries. It is very difficult for householders to deal with the amount of waste but they have little choice in it. Can the Minister look at this as a matter of <Col N="22"/>urgency? Can he look at the significant increases in waste charges to private households? Dublin City Council waste charges just went up by 10% last night and something similar could happen at D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Can the Minister come up with some suggestions on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 482,000 tonnes were handled by packaging waste over the period mentioned. The Deputy is making a very interesting point. When we looked at the electric waste directive, we adopted a different approach by using visible fees. The issue raised by the Deputy will have to be discussed by the strategy group.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is to be complimented because he is certainly on the ball. The Prime Minister has just recently made another speech on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not hanging out of the rafters looking at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The UK White Paper on Energy in 2003 contained no proposals for new nuclear capacity but the option was not ruled out. It was stated that new nuclear plant might be necessary in the future to meet UK carbon commitments related to climate change. The paper envisaged full public consultation before making any decision. However, earlier today, Prime Minister Blair announced a review of the UK&rsquo;s progress against the medium and long-term energy White Paper goals. This will specifically address the issue of new nuclear plant in the context of an updated energy policy statement to be published in the summer of 2006. The UK energy minister will undertake extensive public and stakeholder consultation as part of this review and Ireland will engage fully in this process. Improved co-operative arrangements between the UK and Ireland on nuclear issues will be important in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland remains firmly opposed to the nuclear industry on the grounds of the many risks it poses to human health, the environment and the economy, as well as risks associated with waste and transport. Environmental consequences have arisen for Ireland from historical and ongoing discharges to the sea from Sellafield and the potential risk for a serious accident or incident at nuclear plants including Sellafield. Any proposals by the UK to develop new nuclear capacity must <Col N="23"/>be addressed in this context. At my recent meeting in London with the UK Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr. Alan Johnson MP, I restated this position on Ireland&rsquo;s nuclear safety. I did so again last week when I met the chairman and the chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in Dublin, stressing to them that the safe and speedy decommissioning of existing sites is the only way forward.</P>
        <P>I reject the argument that nuclear energy, as a carbon-free and plentiful source of energy, can provide a solution to problems of climate change and energy supply. That is a fundamentally weak analysis. The reality is that the nuclear industry carries with it serious environmental and safety risks and the costs in both economic and environmental terms are unsustainable. The Government will continue to represent this view to the United Kingdom at every available opportunity, including at relevant public consultation processes which may arise from any proposals for new building.</P>

However, as a result of the Cabinet&rsquo;s decision to shut down the Freedom of Information Act, 90 of the 120 items which could have been released to me were refused. The Minister&rsquo;s policy of keeping the public ignorant is unacceptable, wrong and disgraceful.</P><Col N="24"/>

However, I am unable to acquire any information and the Minister voted within the Cabinet to amend the Freedom of Information Act.

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the target which Ireland has set in the national climate change strategy for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2012; the reduction achieved to date in 2005; the estimated annual cost to Ireland if greenhouse gas emissions remain at their current level; the target for reduction in greenhouse gases for each year between now and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36762/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The national climate change strategy sets out Ireland&rsquo;s approach to meeting its target for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol, <Col N="26"/>which is to limit the growth in greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels in the 2008 to 2012 commitment period. It was projected that, in the absence of any measures to address the problem, Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in that period could be some 37% above 1990 levels. The target relates to the average for the Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008 to 2012 and is not defined on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the latest year for which figures are available, Ireland&rsquo;s emissions were approximately 25% above the 1990 level. This figure is down from 31% in 2001 and 29% in 2002. This progress is satisfactory but rapid growth in the economy is nonetheless placing an upward pressure on our greenhouse gas emissions and requires us to intensify efforts to bring about the required reductions.</P>
        <P>The latest available projections of greenhouse gas emissions for the 2008 to 2012 commitment period suggest that, in the absence of any additional measures, the estimated gap, that is, the distance to the target will be approximately 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The Government is acting to close this gap in three ways. A proportion of the required reduction will be allocated to Irish participants in the EU emissions trading scheme. Following a review of the national climate change strategy, the Government will bring forward further measures to secure reductions across the rest of the economy. The Government will avail of the mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol which allows it to meet its obligations by purchasing credits for carbon reductions elsewhere in the world.</P>
        <P>The Government has also signalled its intention to purchase up to 3.7 million allowances for each year of the Kyoto Protocol commitment period. On the basis of an assessed average price of &euro;15 per carbon allowance during the period 2008 to 2012, the total annual cost to the Exchequer would be &euro;55.5 million. The ultimate cost to the Exchequer will depend on the final purchasing requirement and the price of carbon when the credits are purchased. As the figures are projections covering the period from 2008 to 2012, it is impossible to state exactly what the figures will be then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the projected cost, is the cost of &euro;55.5 million per year the worst case scenario? The Minister stated that we must close a gap of 8 million tonnes of carbon to meet our Kyoto Protocol target in six years&rsquo; time. Hence, will we achieve an annual reduction in the order of 1.5 million tonnes of carbon between now and 2012? Will the Minister indicate to the House how that will be achieved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the figure of &euro;55.5 million, it was calculated on the basis of &euro;15 per unit for the period from 2008 to 2012.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="27"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the basis of a figure of &euro;15 per carbon unit in the period specified. As I stated in the final sentence of my reply, the ultimate cost to the Exchequer will depend on the final purchasing requirement and the price of carbon credits during the time when they are calculated.</P>
        <P>As for the Deputy&rsquo;s query whether it would be annualised, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. As the Deputy is aware, the commitment period extends from 2008 to 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am aware that this is a commitment period, its final year is now only six years&rsquo; away. We have a gap of 8 million tonnes of carbon to close. We have not done very well in the past five years since the climate change strategy was published. The Minister has avoided answering the question on the worst case scenario for the obvious reason that he does not want to admit what I have alleged, just as he did not want to admit it when interviewed on radio.</P>
        <P>Is it the case that Ireland will not meet the target of 13% by 2012? Will the Government&rsquo;s way out be to use taxpayers&rsquo; money to allow the country to continue to pollute? Is this not the picture the Minister is painting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the most extraordinary distortion of the reality. As Deputy Gilmore well knows, under the Kyoto Protocol there are many different ways in which a state party to the protocol can reach its targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Including buying its way out of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Including buying, that is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>With taxpayers&rsquo; money. How much taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Government buys anything, it does so using taxpayers&rsquo; money. If the Deputy had the forbearance to let me finish my sentence, I would inform him that there is a logic to the process, as he knows. One can either go the most economically costly way or, alternatively, buy green credits, from a developing country for example. This process in envisaged and central to the protocol. The Deputy knows this as well as I do and therefore there is no point in his acting as if he were astonished.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore also asked me about the worst case scenario &mdash; the worst case scenario is the worst case scenario. I have outlined to the <Col N="28"/>Deputy the basis on which the calculations are made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>How will the Minister be able to look his UK counterparts in the eye and lecture them about nuclear energy when this country, under his stewardship, is failing to meet its commitments on carbon reduction under the Kyoto Protocol?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The repetition that this country is failing to meet its targets is patent nonsense given that we are talking about a period from 2008. Time and again, I have outlined to the Deputy, who does not like to hear facts, the reductions from 31% in 2001 and 29% in 2002 to 25% in 2003, the last year for which figures are available. I also said very frankly to him that, as economic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They are increases. We are 25% over the target level and the rest of Europe is 7% under.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is now showing that he has a very flawed grasp of basic numeric accuracy. With all due respect to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We have one of the worst records in Europe in regard to carbon emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;25% is not higher than 29% or 31%.</P>

        <QRef>[36556/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 15 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>I met the Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr. Alan Johnson, in London on 19 October. The primary focus of our meeting was a discussion on the incident at the THORP plant in Sellafield last April. I took the opportunity to widen the discussion and set out Ireland&rsquo;s views on other nuclear issues, including the possible commissioning of new nuclear power plants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the serious matter of the THORP leak, while the leak was contained and had no immediate implications for Ireland, I made clear to the Secretary of State the Government&rsquo;s grave concern over the occurrence and potential recurrence of such an incident. I underlined its particular concern that British Nuclear Fuels Limited&rsquo;s own report had found a culture of complacency at Sellafield which ultimately led to the accident. The Secretary of State confirmed to me that the UK Government is undertaking a review of the THORP plant with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which assumed responsibility for the Sellafield site in April 2005. While I welcomed this development, it is not yet clear when this review process will be completed.</P>
        <P>I also sought assurances that the THORP plant will be closed by 2010, as scheduled based on current known contracts. I pressed the Secretary of State on the matter and am satisfied that assurances given in this matter are genuine and that that date will see the closure. I pressed him very firmly because I know Deputies are most anxious about the matter, particularly about the fact that the leak could delay the process. I am aware that the UK nuclear regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is investigating the THORP incident. Its report, when complete, should be published at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>I also raised the issue of security at Sellafield with the Secretary of State and we both noted the improved co-operation and information-sharing processes that the two Governments have put in place. These have come about as a result of the international legal actions which Ireland has pursued against the United Kingdom under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
        <P>While the UK Government has indicated it is under some constraint in regard to the provision of security information at Sellafield, within that context the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has visited the plant and a report of that visit was published in April of this year. Further visits are planned. In addition, a liaison system with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also in place and <Col N="30"/>those concerned visit Sellafield on a regular basis. The reports on these visits are confidential, by agreement of both Governments, but the UK Government has provided assurance that risk assessment is continuous and that the security arrangements at Sellafield are under continuous assessment and review.</P>
        <P>I also took the opportunity to anticipate future UK energy policy considerations by informing the Secretary of State that if there are proposals to develop and commission new nuclear capacity, because of climate change or any other reason, Ireland would use every opportunity to put forward its view that, with such serious environmental and safety risks, the economic and environmental costs of nuclear power are unsustainable.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, Prime Minister Blair announced a review of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s progress against the medium-term and long-term goals in the White Paper on Energy. This will specifically address the issue of new nuclear build in the UK. The intention following that review is to publish an energy policy statement in the summer of next year. I understand the UK Minister with responsibility for energy will undertake extensive public and stakeholder consultation in this regard. Ireland will engage fully and proactively in all stakeholder processes to oppose any such development and will take all measures necessary to protect the interests of its citizens.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any developing plans for privatisation in the nuclear industry in the United Kingdom. Obviously, if such plans emerged, Ireland would be opposed to them in principle. We would examine them closely and make our views known to the UK authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The very long-winded response of the Minister is a far cry from &ldquo;Roche launches nuclear war on Blair&rdquo;. His spin doctor obviously got a different hand regarding the matter than the one he is presenting to us. A large section of the nuclear industry in Britain has been privatised. At a recent meeting of the committee, it emerged that while the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that has been set up is not directly responsible for that sector, it was aware there were intentions to further privatise the industry. Its own operation for decommissioning is partly privatised. Does the Minister agree that privatisation is a very dangerous road to go down given the importance of safety in the industry? Does he not agree that there is a real danger that privatised organisations will cut corners to make profit? The nature and make-up of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority are such that it is in that category.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the Minister answered Question No. 15 although he told us a lot about the accident. Is there any hope or chance that the THORP plant will not reopen? Did the Minister <Col N="31"/>raise this with his UK counterpart when he talked to him? We certainly raised it with the decommissioning agency but it was not its business. In fairness to the ambassador, he assisted somewhat but was not able to give a definitive reply, as ambassadors are wont to do. Will the Minister state what he found out about the plant starting up again? In this regard, I am not referring to the 2010 date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s view exactly on privatisation in this industry. Given the litany of extraordinary behaviour, particularly in BNFL, over the years, we share a common concern on this issue. With regard to whether THORP will start up again, and it still has not yet re-started, my primary concern was that there would not be an extension beyond 2010 of either the contracts or THORP. I wanted to get an assurance that there would not be an excuse to go beyond 2010 and, second, I wanted to secure an assurance that there would be no new contracts. I pressed the Secretary of State time and again on the matter and I believe the assurances given by him were genuine. He reiterated the point a number of times. We did not discuss when it might re-open. My focus was on ensuring that it closes in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>In a reply to my parliamentary question on 25 October, the Minister said that the Secretary of State had confirmed to him that the UK Government is undertaking a new review of the THORP plant with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which assumed responsibility for the Sellafield site and operations in April 2005, following this year&rsquo;s serious incident. Is that review completed? Has the Minister been informed when it might be completed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not been informed of what stage the review has reached. At that time the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was in its relatively early days. The issue I focused on was the closure date. I did not want any excuse to arise from the protracted period of its closure to be used to extend it beyond 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The picture has changed since that meeting. The British Government now intends to build ten new nuclear power stations. Those stations will generate a significant amount of waste and there is only one place to reprocess it, which is Sellafield. Does the Minister not think there is greater urgency about this now? I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides on this matter but does he not believe we should be far more assertive, given the new situation, in pointing out strongly to the British Government that we are deeply unhappy with its proposed new agenda? It must have serious implications for this country. Where will the waste go? The British <Col N="32"/>will not export it; they will send it to Sellafield. Where will the new plants be located? Will they be located on the coast facing this country? That is what concerns us. We must make it crystal clear that we will not accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree we will have to make it clear. It is important that this debate in the House is heard. There is unanimity in the House that this is playing with fire. We are aware of the dangers of nuclear power and this nation is committed to remaining non-nuclear. I will continue to make that point in our contacts. We will also use the stakeholder process to put down our marker. The Deputy asked if the stations are likely to be on the Sellafield site. I mentioned that in the course of my meeting and got the distinct impression that there would not be a rebuild on the Sellafield site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The key issue is where the waste will go. It will go to Sellafield.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They are closing THORP down by 2010. That is precisely the point we were making about the date for the closure. Our big concern about THORP was to ensure that it would be closed down by 2010. We will continue to press that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a very definite proposal. It is not just an energy review. The British Government&rsquo;s energy review will report next summer and will look in detail at the development of a new generation of nuclear power stations. That is quite specific. Those stations will create waste and risk for Ireland. There will be no gain for Ireland. Has the Minister dealt with this in any way before it is a <i>fait accompli</i>? Perfidious Albion will do its usual thing and say it is reviewing but the decision is already made. The Minister should take it that the decision has been made and should deal with it as a decision. Will the Minister go in person to the stakeholders&rsquo; meeting and present Ireland&rsquo;s case? I did it previously and I believe it was effective. The Minister should do that.</P>
        <P>We raised the question of what would happen to the waste with the decommissioning group that came to visit us. The group said it was examining the geological option. That is the underground dump option for nuclear waste, which we fought previously. It creates a problem that lasts an eternity. It cannot ever be decommissioned. That is what is being considered again because it is the simplest thing to do. I ask the Minister to raise this issue in particular. That option would create a bone of contention between our countries on a permanent basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not thought of the strategy of attending the meeting. It is a good point and I <Col N="33"/>will bear it in mind when we get closer to it. Prime Minister Blair&rsquo;s speech was at lunchtime today. I do not disagree with the Deputy. There is a determination in some parts of the British Government to push ahead with this. However, I get the feeling that there is not the same determination in other parts of that Government.</P>

	<P>A new anti-nuke club.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is strange how people have changed on this issue in that country. There does not appear to be the unanimity there might be on it. One does not know what would happen if there was a change in management. Let us hope for the best but prepare for the worst. In fact, I will take up the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion and examine the option of attending the stakeholder consultation process.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the UK Government has cancelled all it plans to run trials of electronic voting in advance of UK local elections in 2006; if, in view of this, he intends to abandon the electronic voting project altogether; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36644/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Governments in different jurisdictions, including the UK, will adopt varying approaches to electoral issues according to their own circumstances and priorities at any given time. For example, the UK operates a first past the post electoral system and it is not advocated in this House that the UK should be an exemplar for us in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Government decision in February 2000 to move to electronic voting and counting in Ireland aimed at securing a broad range of identified benefits compared to the current manual arrangements, including more democratic outcomes through the minimisation of invalid votes and the more accurate counting of votes, provision of a higher level of service to the public, greater flexibility and speed in the voting and counting processes, and increased use of modern information and communications technologies. The decision followed extensive research on electronic voting systems and experiences in other countries and the trial conducted in Ireland about which, it will be recalled, the main Opposition party was most enthusiastic.</P>
        <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004, which confirms the use of electronic voting and counting at Irish elections, maintains the mandate from the Government and the Oireachtas to work towards implementation of electronic voting and counting. Accordingly, a programme of further assessment, testing and validation of the electronic vot<Col N="34"/>ing and counting system is under way to address issues raised by the Commission on Electronic Voting and demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately. As part of this programme and following an open procurement process, my Department appointed consultants in July 2005 to undertake a security and risk assessment of all aspects of the system. This work is now well under way and will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great relief to hear the Government has appointed consultants to examine the security of electronic voting and to conduct a risk assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The confidence in our counting ability is such that the Deputy should breathe a sigh of relief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It will reassure the country. The British Government sensibly decided to carry out tests of electronic voting before committing itself to using electronic voting in elections. The last tests were in 2003 and more trials were scheduled for 2004, but these were abandoned on the advice of the electoral commission. They have now abandoned the whole idea. Whatever the Minister may think of the British electoral system, the British Government has approached the issue of electronic voting more sensibly than the crowd of &ldquo;electro-Paddies&rdquo; which purchased machines software without testing them. What will the Minister do with the machines? He has stated that they will not be used in the next general election, so what is to become of them? Will the Minister find some place, such as Zimbabwe or Florida, which may need the assistance of these machines? The machines could be sold as a job lot and we could at least cut our losses. We would not have to pay the &euro;750,000 cost of storing the machines every year. It is time to cut our losses on the botched electronic voting system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am familiar with the Deputy&rsquo;s views on the issue. With regard to the UK, 27 different pilot projects were carried out, with the forms of voting ranging from SMS text voting &mdash; I do not understand how that would work &mdash; to Internet, postal and electronic voting, which would be a similar process to our own. More recently, the focus in the last British general election was on the large-scale provision of postal voting. It is intended to continue their activities in this regard, although there was concern over security.</P>
        <P>The UK Government has recently decided not to seek applications for local authorities to pilot the use of electronic voting systems. Electronic voting systems are used elsewhere and we piloted them here.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>If only the Minister had listened to me in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be disingenuous as I do not know what the Deputy stated at the time, but the Deputy would have demonstrated more prescience than other members of the Opposition. The Deputy asked if we will give the machines away, but that would not be a sensible suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We could sell them. Is there a market for electronic voting machines?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be a charge under the WEEE directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A charge would have to be paid if I sold them on. I am looking at the storage issue and I hope to resolve it as I am seeking to identify a storage location with my colleagues. It does not serve a purpose to have the machines in expensive storage on a decentralised basis. They will not be used in the 2007 elections, but I would not hold my breath after that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem with storage is the ambient temperature and other issues regarding the quality and capacity of the location. The machines cannot be placed in a bin or large space in a basement. Is it not important to now move on and get people out to vote? The numbers of people voting in general elections is reducing, particularly in urban areas. We need more polling stations near where people work or shop. Fewer people are voting now, in percentage terms, than was the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct and we should facilitate people&rsquo;s voting. In the British debate on electronic and Internet voting in particular, a possibility that was thought attractive was that people vote in a booth in a supermarket.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Given our experience we should make haste slowly. I agree with the Deputy in that changing lifestyles have necessitated that voting be made easier. We should encourage people to vote and ensure we have a proper voting register.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>How much are the services of the consultants who have been appointed to check on the machines, see if they are affected by damp and ensure that nobody is trying to steal or copy the patents, which would cost the taxpayer on top of the other wasted funding for these machines?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that the machines will not be used in 2007. That will probably see me out anyway. If he reads the minutes of the Oireachtas committees relating to environmental matters he will see I never had faith in these machines.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>his views on whether the distributors of free newspapers should be compelled to make arrangements for recollection and recycling of the paper.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36676/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant progress has been made in recent years in providing systems and facilities for the collection and recycling of waste. Households served with segregated collection of dry recyclables can recycle their old newspapers by depositing them in their recyclables wheelie bin. This service is being progressively rolled out, with over 560,000 households nationally &mdash; approximately 42% of all households in the State &mdash; already in receipt of such service.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste requires member states to achieve specified targets for the reduction of biodegradable waste consigned to landfill. A draft national biodegradable waste strategy setting out a range of integrated measures aimed at providing an effective basis for the achievement of the directive targets was published last year. The final strategy, which I hope to publish shortly, will include ambitious <Col N="38"/>targets for the recycling of biodegradable waste, including newsprint. Further progress will be required in expanding the recycling infrastructure to meet these targets.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the newsprint industry with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative for the recovery and recycling of newspapers and magazines. I am concerned that such an initiative should deal fully with all newspapers and magazines, irrespective of the manner in which they are marketed. I am also concerned that the proliferation of hand-outs such as freesheets and promotional leaflets should have regard to the implications for waste prevention and litter pollution.</P>
        <P>The general point being made by Deputies Cuffe and Gogarty is that there has been a horrific proliferation of litter in and around the Luas and DART, and I agree with that. What has occurred recently is irresponsible, and I know the conventional newspaper industry shares my views on this. There is concern about what is happening. There were complaints from staff at Westland Row that the new free-sheets were blocking up litter bins and were deposited all over the road. Luas and Dublin Bus also made complaints in this regard. Producer responsibility is necessary from those distributing the free-sheets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that we are <i>ad idem</i> on the matter. I welcome the new entrants to the marketplace. We would always welcome new media such as <i>Herald AM</i> and <i>Metro</i>. However, the downside to their entry to the market is the flurry of paper that is, as the Minister stated, making DART carriages look like Wall Street after a ticker tape parade.</P>
        <P>I do not want to single out one producer of waste over another. The principle is that if one supplies a product that must eventually be disposed of, one should pay some proportion of its disposal cost. I am delighted the Minister is in discussion with the industry. When will he regulate in this area and what kind of regulation does he envisage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in discussions. I strongly believe that a partnership approach is the best way of dealing with this matter. Like the Deputy, I welcome the new entrants to the market and I very much welcome outlets for young journalists to make a mark.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the producers of these free-sheets should identify the major dirt-spots and clean them up. There have been other producer initiatives, for example, in the fast food industry, where outlets clean a specific area. This could happen in the interim in this case. I will continue to work with the industry because there are a variety of ways to address the problem which is caused by a very unconventional form of newspaper litter. However, additional thought will be needed <Col N="39"/>before we solve the problem. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.</P>

As this question relates to waste matters and as the Minister of State has not had an opportunity to contribute during Priority Questions today, will the Minister, Deputy Roche, inform the House whether the statement made by the Minister of State is now Government policy on incineration or does it only apply to Ringaskiddy?</P>

	<P>The present law relating to election expenditure and donations in Ireland was established in the Electoral Act 1997 and has since been amended on five occasions by means of the Electoral (Amendment) Acts 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005. Under current provisions, political parties are allowed to accept a maximum aggregated donation of &euro;6,348 from a single source in any given calendar year, while the limit for an individual public representative is &euro;2,539. I am conscious that the current donation limits were set in 2001 and that over time inflation has eroded their value. There is, incidentally, scope to increase these limits by way of ministerial order having regard to changes in the consumer price index over the relevant period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As the nation is aware, approximately one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s freight capacity is out of action coming into the very busy Christmas period. The action of Irish Ferries management <Col N="42"/>suggests that it is determined either to drive its Irish staff onto the dole queue or into slave labour conditions. That action and the subsequent action by shocked workers is resulting and will result in serious disruption for importers, exporters, the farming community, tourists and consumers. If this dispute is not resolved quickly, manufacturers will soon run out of imported components and exporters will not be able to meet their customer&rsquo;s demands. It will only be a matter of time before jobs are lost and the most serious consequences impact on our economy.</P>
      <P>Given the potential for a crisis, there is an onus on the Government to act effectively. Does the Minister for Finance, who is standing in for the Taoiseach today, agree that the Taoiseach made a tactical mistake last week in saying nothing more could be done by the Government? This resulted in Irish Ferries going ahead with its plan and gave it the green light to proceed as it saw fit.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that the fact one works on a ship means one should be valued any less than if one works in a factory? Does he agree with the Fine Gael spokesman on marine affairs, Deputy Perry, who called on the Government to persuade our European partners to outlaw the practice of re-flagging? Has the Government contacted our European counterparts in this regard? What are the lessons for social partnership, which was designed to avoid exactly this type of problem, and which the Government has repeatedly trumpeted as being a pre-emptive solution to industrial relations disasters such as that now unfolding at Irish Ferries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has in no way given a green light to anybody to walk away from the norms of industrial relations practice. He was simply explaining last week that the full rigours of the industrial relations machinery have been applied to this problem for some time. He said he and the Government, and any responsible person, would always seek respect from all sides for adherence to this process. The Taoiseach has not given a green light to any activity that is not consonant with best industrial relations practice.</P>
      <P>We want to see people&rsquo;s employment rights respected, in whatever industry they work. The Government has always sought to implement social partnership principles and has been the strongest advocate for these principles, on occasions when the Deputy&rsquo;s party had difficulty taking account of them.</P>
      <P>Under EU maritime law there is a right of establishment for the reflagging of vessels. We have made it clear that until such time as that happens the full employment and health and safety law will apply in respect of the use of our ports, regardless of what flag the ship flies. The Fine Gael Party leader is aware of this right of establishment. Until such time as that happens we <Col N="43"/>insist on respect for the industrial relations procedure and employment rights.</P>
      <P>We seek to do that on the basis that everyone in this dispute recognises the implications, not only for this industry and those whose jobs are at risk, but also for the wider social partnership. The Government asks all sides to continue with their discussions at the Labour Relations Commission, which remains available and is anxious to see how these parties can be brought back to the table. At no time has the Taoiseach or the Government sought to excuse anyone who does not adhere to normal industrial relations procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not suggest that the Taoiseach had given the green light for this disastrous series of actions by Irish Ferries, I said that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment that the Government could do no more created a perception of helplessness in the Government which Irish Ferries saw as a green light to act as it did. I would be the first to suggest that, from an economic perspective, Irish Ferries might be seen to be a well-run company, but in the current circumstances it is badly led. It is incumbent on the Taoiseach, as head of Government and leader of the country, to intervene at the highest level and give Irish Ferries that message face to face.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14-?>Everybody in this House believes that the Labour Court recommendations were the basis on which to build. My office, however, like those of other public representatives, has been inundated with calls from worried businesses and customers about the serious implications for our economy of taking out one quarter of the country&rsquo;s freight capacity. The Government should redouble its efforts. If necessary, the Taoiseach should request that the head of management of Irish Ferries call to his office to be given the message face to face that we do not want anything to happen which will damage our economy. In these circumstances Irish Ferries is badly led and it needs to hear that message clearly and directly.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach has communicated that message and continues to do so in respect of the conduct of this dispute. He has made his position clear. From the outset he indicated that he expects respect for employment and Irish law to apply in this case.</P>
      <P>The orderly conduct of industrial relations depends on respect for the basic norms and institutions of the State, especially the Labour Court. While Labour Court recommendations are not generally binding, they should be respected as the proper resolution of disputes. This is especially the case with the Irish Ferries dispute. The court spelt out carefully its views on fundamental aspects of negotiation and collective agreements. It upholds the basic principle that agreements should be honoured unless there are compelling reasons to vary them.</P><Col N="44"/>
      <P>In this case having heard comprehensive arguments from both sides the court concluded that the company had not made a sufficiently compelling case to justify a unilateral termination of its agreement with SIPTU. The court, however, added that all possibilities of renegotiating aspects of the agreement of concern to the company had not been exhausted. It therefore recommended that the parties resume negotiations on such changes as are necessary to address the commercial needs of the company.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the clear risk to the conduct of ordinary industrial relations which the court said would otherwise arise, the Government has strongly urged the parties to enter into negotiations with an independent facilitator if necessary. The issues in dispute between SIPTU and the company could have been resolved. It may still be possible to resolve them but the company&rsquo;s tactics have not helped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that this is a defining moment in our economy and our society? The social partnership that has been the cornerstone of progress for more than 20 years is being jettisoned when it suits the greedy requirements of one company.</P>
      <P>It appears from last night&rsquo;s edition of &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on television that the Irish Ferries route to the bottom has the support and influence of powerful people in bank boardrooms. Is it enough that the Government is seen to be all over the place? Nowhere was that more evident than on the programme last night when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, was caught out with two mutually contradictory positions. He ended up looking like a salmon gulping for air in an illegal net.</P>

	<P>What is new?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is all over the place on this issue. When the Taoiseach made his remarks about walking away, saying there was nothing more the Government could do, he gave the green light to the commando-style raid on the vessel at Pembroke. He wrote to me on 25 November stating: &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s action was clearly planned in a careful and duplicitous way and we can therefore assume it was planned long before my remarks.&rdquo; That is fair enough, but how does the Taoiseach propose to combat this duplicitous conduct? Will he do so by throwing in the towel? That is all that has happened so far. The Minister for Finance repeats the Taoiseach&rsquo;s excuse about the right of establishment in the European Union. He is blatantly misusing that right to which the Taoiseach also referred in his letter to me when he wrote: &ldquo;The State cannot hinder the exercise of that right.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He is standing maritime law on its head. We are parties to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Article 91 of the convention states:</P><Col N="45"/>
      <P LI="1">Every State shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag. Ships have the nationality of the State whose flag they are entitled to fly. There must exist a genuine link between the State and the ship.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Under Article 91 the Taoiseach and the Government are entitled to take action to ensure that Irish Ferries cannot reflag in Cyprus or elsewhere. They can seek to enforce that article at European level.</P>

	<P>Pending reflagging approval, Irish employment laws will continue to be enforced and at all times Irish safety laws will continue to apply to all vessels using Irish ports, wherever they are flagged. Once the vessel is reflagged it is clearly a matter of international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, that the terms and conditions of employed seafarers on such vessels need to be decided exclusively by the flag state. It is crystal clear that we cannot prevent the reflagging that occurs as an integral part of exercising a right of establishment in another member state.</P>

	<P>It is not crystal clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Any company or individual in an EU member state has a right of establishment in any other EU member state. This is a well established provision since the signing of the Treaty of Rome. It is not that I agree or disagree with the idea that this is the mechanism by which Irish employment law would not continue to apply here. We want to see a resolution to the dispute within Irish industrial relations procedures, consistent with our industrial relations tradition on the basis of respect for the norms that apply in Ireland. We want to see both parties in resolution of this dispute as soon as possible, given the implications it could have.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to misrepresent the Government&rsquo;s position as being anything other than that. The Government has done all it possibly can, under the industrial relations machinery available to it, to have the parties concerned before the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and other institutions available to us to resolve the dispute. We have a voluntary method of industrial relations. We want to see talks resume. Today, contacts were made with both sides by the Labour Relations Commission. It has proved dif<Col N="46"/>ficult to even get the parties into the same room to see if a resolution can be made.</P>
      <P>We have made it clear what we believe are the best industrial relations practices that apply to this case thus far. We do not seek to condone or excuse the behaviour of the company in this matter one iota. However, it is not possible to bring forward an interpretation of EU law to suggest that an individual or a corporation does not have a right of establishment in another member state. That is a right available since the 1957 Treaty of Rome, as subsequently amended. Whether this is the case, we do not regard this as an excuse or justification for the current situation. We are guided by the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. While they are not mandatory, they set out a means by which this matter should be resolved. It still can be resolved if sufficient will can be mustered between the parties on that basis, consistent with the highest standards applying in Irish industrial relations law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is taking issue with the Minister on the right of establishment within the EU. If this company wants to establish a company in Cyprus, it can do so. However, I am drawing the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 91 of which makes it plain &ldquo;There must exist a genuine link between the state and the ship&rdquo;. If the Minister for Finance is right, why is the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, according to today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>, requiring the company to explain what the link is if the vessels are to be flagged in Cyprus? Is he just going through the motions, like the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who can take up two different positions on the same subject on the same television programme and forget it at the same time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance can sit down again as I am not finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough. I thought Deputy Rabbitte had finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither is there any point in the Minister saying how much sympathy he has for the workers. Workers up and down the country believe it is not just Irish Ferries that is coming to get them. They believe if this phenomenon of displacement were to take effect in other industries, their jobs would be insecure. This is apart from the considerations raised by Deputy Kenny about trade, tourism and industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Minister for Finance one simple question. Is he going to deny this company the right to reflag its vessels in Cyprus, as he is entitled to do under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea? If so, let the company then con<Col N="47"/>test it through the judicial procedure that is established by way of tribunal to decide it if it wishes to appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister outline to the House what the Government has already done in this dispute? What is the Government now prepared to do to prevent Irish Ferries proceeding on this disastrous course of excluding an Irish workforce, cutting wages, worsening employment conditions and tearing up industrial relations procedures? Will the Minister for Finance undertake with his ministerial colleagues to raise this matter in the European Union? Will the Government work to ensure the introduction of measures to prevent a repeat of this practice within the European Union? Will he encourage the European Union to ensure such an approach is adopted worldwide?</P>
      <P>Is he prepared to change the position adopted by the Government in 2004 when it opposed a draft directive on European ferries at the Council of Ministers? Is he now prepared to push for such a directive to be introduced? Does he agree trade and commerce is now seriously at risk and under pressure as a result of the interface that has been created by Irish Ferries management? Will he accept that this is a strategic company for the economy? Will he accept that now is the time, although late in the day as it is, for the Government to consider the future of Irish Ferries?</P>
      <P Just="Left">Does the Minister agree that what we need is Irish Ferries within, rather than outside, State control? Would he agree that at the very least, in relation to Irish Ferries and much of which this Government has already divested itself without the approval of the people, and in the context of still considering the future of Aer Lingus, what we should have had was the retention of a golden share by the State in strategic companies concerned with air and sea connections within this island, the EU and beyond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to members of the trade union movement, they have made a distinction between the situation in this dispute and the issue of social partnership. Confirming whether we can continue with social partnership depends on several issues which are not germane in this dispute. However, there are certain issues in this matter that the trade unions would like to see resolved satisfactorily.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The protection of employment law and standards is an important goal of public policy. We do not want to revive a low-wage economy and, in particular, we do not want to foster social division by having jobs transformed from decent employment for Irish citizens to low-paid positions targeted at migrant workers. The Govern<Col N="49"/>ment has invested in good employment standards and it is not prepared to see it replaced by short-sighted and exploitative decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>How many employment inspectors are there? This is total hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ultimately, the State winds up subsiding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan is not the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in. The Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the Government has introduced a realistic minimum wage. The Government will do all it can to have this matter resolved on the basis that both sides come together. We must keep in mind that jobs will continue to be at risk for as long as the dispute continues. The need to secure a resolution consistent with the recommendation of the Labour Court is and will continue to be the focus of the Government&rsquo;s endeavours. Any attempt by the Opposition to misrepresent the Government&rsquo;s position will be strenuously defended by Government members. While the Opposition seeks advantage from this issue, we remain consistent in our approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as did those who advocated social partnership in the first place and sought to exercise it while in Government for most of the time since its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not answered my question as to what the Government has done, is doing or intends to do to address directly the debacle that is Irish Ferries today. All the points he made, fine though they are in their own place, will mean nothing to the excluded workforce, including, for instance, the Latvian worker who had the courage to appear on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; to describe the conditions under which she works on the <i>MV Normandy</i>. She works for 12 hours each day, seven days per week with no holidays or days off. Are the Minister and his colleagues happy that a company which bears the name &ldquo;Irish Ferries&rdquo; imposes this type of work regime on its workforce?</P>
      <P>As an aside, is the Minister aware that the so-called security company the management of Irish Ferries brought on board its vessels is a sub-group of Risk Management International, a company formed by former members of our Defence Forces? Real questions arise regarding the conduct of the security firm in question, many of whose members received their training as members of the Defence Forces. Should questions not arise about other Government contracts involving public moneys the company has at various locations? Surely its role is not one of bring<Col N="50"/>ing heavy-handedness to bear on the rights of ordinary Irish workers, as is the case in this instance. This is a serious matter and one which has a great deal of address among the wider public.</P>
      <P>I ask again whether the Minister is prepared to use the opportunities the European Union must offer in having this matter addressed in the context of the EU and to build on the outcome in terms of best practice and standards applying to ferry and sea traffic internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, the Government wants a negotiated settlement to this dispute and asks both sides to use the industrial relations machinery at which the necessary expertise resides to help them resolve the problem. That is the way in which we can resolve this problem. The authority of the Government is behind the institutions of the State which are best placed to assist the parties to resolve the problem and maintain jobs and employment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The company is not listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I outlined to the Deputy in response to his first series of questions that the Government believes the protection of employment standards to be an important goal of public policy and does not want the practices to which the Deputy alluded revived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are doing everything. We have provided the means by which, thankfully, an increasing number of people are in gainful employment. With regard to the specific issue that has arisen, the Government has confirmed it wants the matter resolved in a manner consistent with the employment laws and standards which apply in this country and through the industrial relations procedures available to ensure this takes place, as has happened in respect of many other disputes which have arisen. An attempt is being made in the House to suggest that the Government has some other motivation or objective. Nothing could be further from the truth. The person who normally stands in this place has more reason than any Member of the House to ensure this outcome emerges and has a better track record than other Deputies on these matters.</P>

	<P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. The proposal for dealing with items 10 to 14, motions re Supplementary Estimates, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council framework decision on the European evidence warrant, and motion re membership of committee, is that they be taken without debate. Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed. On the proposed approval by the D&aacute;il of a Council framework decision on the European evidence warrant, as I have objected in the past to all such measures arising out of The Hague programme, we object not only to the motion but also to the fact that we are being asked again to take this without debate. That is absolutely unacceptable. This measure has been discussed twice in the past two months in committee yet, despite the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has acknowledged that a number of issues of substance are still ongoing and under continual consideration, on both occasions the committee voted through both measures arising from the European arrest warrant issue.</P>
      <P>The Hague programme is being introduced in what I would describe as an anti-democratic and authoritarian fashion. Unless we get the opportunity to discuss it properly here in its real context, measure after measure will go through the House in this way without debate. Issues of concern not just to me and the Sinn F&eacute;in Party but to many people, which should be of concern to everyone, are not being addressed substantively. We need to take on board what the Minister has said in this regard, that points have been shown to be, and are, in need of review. We are asking that this matter be addressed here. I oppose the proposal to, once again, proceed without debate on this measure.</P><Col N="54"/>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion of no confidence was mentioned before and this calls for some comment on my part, lest in not doing so the position of the Chair, which includes both the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is misconstrued. A motion of no confidence, while perhaps a significant step in its own right, is a substantive motion and procedurally is the correct way to proceed. On being elected to the Chair both the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I made a declaration that we would execute our respective offices in an impartial and fair manner. I am entirely satisfied that I have presided over proceedings in accordance with the rules of Standing Orders laid down by the Members of this House and the precedents established by my illustrious predecessors since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I am now extending an invitation to any leader of any party who may have difficulty with my rulings to come to my office and I will be glad to clarify issues of concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three questions. First, will the Minister for Finance indicate what progress has been made in the case of the decent woman who has been outside the gates of Leinster House for a number of weeks in regard to the redress institutions? She has a very strong case to make.</P>
      <P>Second, in May of this year and repeatedly since, I asked the Taoiseach about the implementation of the Children Act 2001. Sections 96, 111, 112, 155 to 132, inclusive, and 137 to 139, inclusive, deal with parental supervision, community sanctions, mentor-family support, day centre orders and so on. It is a complex Bill and I know that the Minister of State is dealing with it, but perhaps the Minister for Finance can bring us up to date on that matter. The Taoiseach wrote to me about it in May and referred to it on a number of occasions since then. If the Minister does not have the details today perhaps he will send them on to me before the House rises for the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Third, in respect of health matters, the pharmacy No. 1 Bill and the pharmacy No. 2 Bill are listed for 2006. Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England have chief pharmacists operating at the highest level, advising the Government and regional executives &mdash; they are proactive in advising the Government on pharmacy policy &mdash; but we do not have such a system and the post of chief pharmacist has not been filled.</P>

      <P>I will have to revert to the Deputy concerning the specific issue of the Children Act as the details are not available to me at the moment.</P>
      <P>As regards the person to whom the Deputy referred in his first question, unfortunately the State did not have a role in monitoring that institution and therefore it could not be included in the redress institutions. The Minister for Education and Science spoke directly to the lady on that basis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I know the Government is not used to the scenario of Ministers resigning but the chairman of the National Safety Council, Mr. Eddie Shaw, resigned. Regarding promised legislation to deal with road safety, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, said publicly in newspapers he would introduce legislation to establish the road safety authority by the end of 2005. Can the Minister for Finance indicate whether this can be taken as legislation in its own right or is it part of legislation we have notice of, such as the roads miscellaneous provisions Bill, which is due by 2006? It was promised for 2004 and 2005. Given the gravity of the development of Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s resignation, will the Minister indicate whether the Government will bring forward this legislation or will a debate on road safety be allowed in the meantime? It is predicted that 380 people will die on our roads this year with thousands more traumatised and bereaved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is very relevant to current events in the working world. Many industrial disputes have occurred because of lack of communication within the workplace. The import<Col N="63"/>ance of communication in any workplace or business is often overlooked and especially if industrial disputes arise. If the right mechanics of communication are put in place, it can often stop industrial disputes happening. Many working hours have been lost because of the lack of a channel of communication between employers and workers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This Bill is an attempt to bridge the information gap between worker and employer and this attempt is long overdue. Any legislation that does something to improve industrial relations will always have my support. It is important to have a formal means of dialogue within the world of work. Without communication, resentments can fester, leading to future trouble in the workplace. The industrial peace secured by the rainbow coalition has been threatened by the &ldquo;could not care less&rdquo; governing style of this current coalition. Thanks to a European directive, the Minister is finally bringing through the D&aacute;il a Bill which provides some movement on the important plank of Sustaining Progress. However, employers in the shape of IBEC have already signalled their concerns about this Bill. I can understand their point of view as they already do business in a highly regulated environment. If the Government is going to add another layer of regulation, it had better get it right on this occasion.</P>
      <P>We can all recognise the benefits of consultation and sharing information. I refer to the ongoing dispute in An Post and a consultation forum might have been of help in this case. Strike action has been threatened in An Post over the past months and years. A strike in An Post would create grave difficulties for the economy, especially facing into the Christmas period. The importance of communication within An Post should be noted.</P>
      <P>I refer to the situation in Irish Ferries. Who could have predicted some months ago that the Irish Ferries situation would have come to this stage? If the workers had been kept informed about the company&rsquo;s plans from the word go, I do not think the situation would now be as serious. The situation in Irish Ferries which is now out of hand will be the subject for discussion under Standing Order 31 this evening. Over the past few days, we have witnessed an Irish company behaving in a manner which I never thought I would see. I never thought I would see the day when an Irish company would send in people in suits and security men to handle Irish workers in the way they did. The loyal workforce, the seafarers of Irish Ferries, have given years of great service to a company for which they had a high regard. I do not think any of the Irish Ferries workers would have expected to have been treated in this way.</P>
      <P>The more information that is shared in the workplace, the better that workplace will be. <Col N="64"/>Sharing information allows people to be aware of what is happening, of the future plans within a company and of what that company expects of its workers. If that type of information is shared and if everyone is brought on board, there will be a far better relationship among employees and management right down the line.</P>
      <P>It is easy to forget that workers and management all have one ultimate aim, namely, to ensure that a company &mdash; whether it be involved in engineering, processing or whatever &mdash; provides their wages. Most people also want to see their company being on top and doing its best. If something happens or if the boat sinks, they all go down together. I do not mean that badly in the case of Irish Ferries. It is important that all employees should be kept informed.</P>
      <P>Employers need not fear the idea behind this Bill. The consultation process is designed for two situations, namely, collective redundancy and major changes in work practices. Using consultation in these circumstances can only be good for workers, managers and everyone else involved.</P>
      <P>Even though the Minister is following Europe on this, I am glad that he is recognising the many ways in which workers can help their companies. That workers can do so is important. As stated earlier, all workers and management are aiming at the one goal. Until now, ideas seemed to flow in one direction, from the employers to the workforce. Now members of workforces, through forums, will be able to contribute their ideas for the good of a company.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, employers must provide information on important matters such as the future direction of a firm, major changes in practice or changes to contract. When they are discussing important matters such as the future direction of a company, it gives workers a kind of partial responsibility as well. It is probably good to see that happening because it means workers will have an important and pivotal role to play in their workplaces.</P>
      <P>With this kind of information at their disposal, workers will be able to make useful suggestions to management and to help in drawing up plans for the future. It is important for workers to draw up useful suggestions to management in the context that they can all play major roles. This is a big step forward because we all know of firms that were in trouble but that kept their workforces in the dark until it was too late. We have seen it for many years, particularly in the past three to four. The Government often states that it is creating 1,000 jobs per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see too many jobs coming to Wexford. I could bring the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to many places in Wexford for which we are seeking jobs.</P><Col N="65"/>
      <P>There is nothing as bad as 60, 70, 200, 300 or whatever number of employees being brought into their workplace and told that the company is closing down in one, two or three weeks. These employees would have given so much to that company and would have so much on their shoulders, whether it be in the form of mortgages, car loans, credit union loans, bank loans, etc. Due to the fact the employees were left in the dark and that this happened all of a sudden, they would not be in a position to seek alternative employment, streamline or whatever. It has often been the case that a workforce has had better ideas than management in terms of how to keep a firm afloat. There were reports last week about a company in Sligo that was taken over by an American company and closed down within a number of months. That must have been devastating news for the employees. They were sure that a multinational company was taking over and thought that their futures were bright, that they would be there for many years and that, perhaps, they would climb the ladder within the company. However, all of a sudden the entire company has been shut down. I do not doubt that this news was devastating for all involved, particularly in the lead-up to Christmas.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are still major questions surrounding this legislation, for example, how much of a difference will it make to most of the firms within Ireland. The largest companies already have their own consultation procedures with their workforces and the smallest are not contemplated under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister introducing a Bill that will just sit on the shelf? There are far too many of those already. They sit on Government shelves beside an increasing number of reports. In a parliamentary question tabled earlier in the year, I asked each Department how much it spent on reports. There is a large number of such reports, which either have not been implemented or which are just lying on Government shelves gathering dust. It is easy to introduce a Bill or to undertake a report on a matter merely to avoid answering a question. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, formerly the Minister for Health and Children, was brilliant in undertaking reports to avoid answering questions.</P>
      <P>The Government would never have introduced a Bill like this on its own initiative. The only reason it has done so is because it was given a direction from Europe. Most of this type of legislation has been handed down from Europe. Why is it left to the European Commission or the European Parliament to make these laws? Why is the Government not doing its duty in this regard?</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Government is running out of steam and ideas. One need only look at the legislative programme to see that it has almost given up in that regard. However, it finally introduced this Bill after a long wait and I sup<Col N="66"/>pose we all should be grateful that the legislation has come this far.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I must criticise the Bill for the creeping bureaucracy I see within it. There is much provision for certain numbers of employees to trigger certain actions. My feeling is that this sort of approach leads to, rather than avoids, conflict. There is no need for the Bill to be bureaucratic. The idea behind it is simple and sensible. It is the Government that has added the red tape to this Bill. We have seen what red tape can do in any walk of life. It is ludicrous bringing red tape into the Bill. The Government cannot make it pure and simple. I refer, for example, to the new section 18, introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad, which provides that the Minister may appoint inspectors for the purposes of the legislation. The powers of the inspectors are set out and include that to enter certain premises to make such examinations or inquiries as may be necessary for ascertaining whether the legislation is being complied with and require the production of relevant records and information. The section also provides for offences of obstruction and non-compliance with requests from an inspector.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31: Irish Ferries Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this important matter to be debated by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. We are calling on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to intervene with Irish Ferries in order to ensure that our exports, employment standards and the continuation of social partnership are protected. I wish to share time with Deputies Perry and Kehoe.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party has watched the unfolding of events in Irish Ferries with a growing sense of disgust and horror. The company&rsquo;s actions have been an example of the worst type of Dickensian exploitation I have ever seen in this country. Irish Ferries is an Irish-registered subsidiary company. As such, it should be subject to the laws of this country, including legislation that protects the minimum wage and makes provision for employee protection and health and safety. It has been allowed to get away with industrial marauding as a result of a legal nonsense. This debate is not concerned with immigration, globalisation or free market economics. I believe firmly in an open market, a flexible employment atmosphere and the value of non-nationals coming to Ireland to work. This debate, rather, is about a greedy and grubby company that is intent on maximising profits. It is not just seeking a cheaper labour force; it is intent on putting in place a criminally cheap one by abusing European maritime law and exploiting Irish labour conditions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">An industrial relations infrastructure has been established in this country, which, at the very <Col N="67"/>least, ensures that workers from new countries cannot be exploited and must be paid a decent wage. That legislation has protected Irish workers from having their jobs replaced by new arrivals to our shores. Europe-wide policies are required to ensure that we have proper workplace standards so that Irish employees are not dumped on the scrapheap of unemployment and replaced by workers from other member states of the European Union. It is not acceptable that Irish Ferries, for no good reason other than that it runs ships as opposed to buses or trains, does not have to obey the laws of this land.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, it has run roughshod over 40 years of industrial diplomacy. We should be mindful that this industrial diplomacy has helped to create the conditions that fomented the Celtic tiger, from which everyone, including Irish Ferries, has benefited. The Government has been slow to come up with a solution to this problem. The Taoiseach and other members of Government have criticised Irish Ferries, by empathising with the workers and admonishing the company, but this is not enough. My colleague, Deputy Perry, in an effort to be helpful, has called within the past week or two for the Minister to seek support from his EU counterparts to have the practice of reflagging outlawed throughout the European Union. It is only by doing this that we can rid the seas and this country of the cancer of exploitation that Irish Ferries seems intent on spreading through the body politic.</P>
      <P>The Irish people have shown their support for the European Union, time and again. This initiative must be addressed through the EU to ensure that the activities of Irish Ferries are deemed illegal, just as they have been found to be immoral by almost everybody, with the exception of the representatives of certain august bodies who should know better. The management of Irish Ferries should be obliged to remain loyal to the social partnership process. It should have been loyal to the people who helped it become profitable. I wonder whether it can count on the loyalty of the Irish people in the future. The Irish are fair-minded people. They certainly condemn indecency and dishonesty in company affairs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also wonder whether Irish Ferries can depend on the loyalty of exporters, importers and tourists who have been so inconvenienced during this sorry drama. Even at this late stage, I urge the company to have a change of heart. My party leader earlier called on the Taoiseach to gather the players together and resolve this problem. I acknowledge that this is easier said than done. Nonetheless, the machinery of the State, which has been deployed to best advantage to try to resolve this crisis through the Labour Court, has come up with a reasonable set of proposals, which the company stated, unilaterally, that it cannot implement. If social partnership is to be achieved to the ultimate degree, all the players concerned <Col N="68"/>must be involved in the give and take process. Workers must take particular agreements on board in order to progress, as has been the case under the various national wage agreements since 1987. Equally, employers must do the same. However, when an employer such as Irish Ferries unilaterally turns down an invitation from the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, namely, the Labour Court, to proceed with the implementation of its plans on the basis of a negotiated settlement, this is a very worrying trend and something of which we should not be proud.</P>
      <P>The Irish Ferries dispute is encapsulated in the fact that companies are increasingly under threat in terms of their competitiveness. Irish Ferries believes that because of the stealth taxes and charges imposed in this jurisdiction, the Irish labour market is no longer appropriate to its conditions of employment. The high wage spiral and the high costs associated with this are now having rip-off and knock-on effects as regards competitiveness. At this stage, however, the threat of tear gas is the last straw as regards the ultimate response of fair-minded people in this country towards this dispute. It is an unhelpful throwback to the last century that any company should seek to protect the security of its ships by employing tear gas. That is not the essence of partnership. Neither does it assist the process which seeks to ensure that our exporting potential, as an island nation, is protected and that the employment standards derived under social partnership are in place. I ask the Minister, Deputy Martin, to take every possible opportunity to intervene. I appreciate that it is not easy to get a company such as Irish Ferries to listen. However, this debate should provide him with the necessary support to ensure that he intervenes with Irish Ferries on a continuous basis. He should also ensure at EU level that there is a co-ordinated response as regards employment standards. Flags of convenience and reflagging should not be used to promote cheap and exploited labour in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Hogan on raising this important issue. This dispute will not come as a surprise to many people who take an interest in maritime matters. People may be surprised and appalled by the tactics employed by Irish Ferries. However, this crisis was entirely avoidable and the Government could have played a greater role in preventing it. Since 2002, when marine matters ceased to be represented directly at the Cabinet table, there has been an absence of any strategic focus or direction in this regard. Marine and maritime issues have become an add-on to a Department that deals with broadcasting, e-commerce, mining, energy and telecommunications. I do not doubt that if the marine had full Cabinet status in its own right, the crisis we now face could have been avoided.</P><Col N="69"/>
      <P>I understand, for example, that proposals were advanced to the Department of Finance by the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, that could have alleviated the position in which Irish Ferries found itself in the context of high costs. The IMDO received the sector&rsquo;s proposals about three years ago and recommended their implementation. The report has been with the Department for the past three years. Another factor is that the Government failed to reintroduce the PRSI rebate scheme, which ended in 2003. This could have been used effectively for seafarers in order to bring Ireland into line with practices in other EU countries. Under UK legislation, seafarers in international waters are effectively exempt from national insurance, which lowers the cost of employing them. If State aids had been in place for the past three years, along with benefit to seafarers, it would certainly have helped considerably. As an island nation, we have a national imperative to take a strategic approach to the establishment and maintenance of links by sea between this country and other states. The extent of our dependence on sea transport for both exports and imports is highlighted by the fact that 35% of national export capacity is threatened as a result of the difficulties at Irish Ferries. This will have a direct impact on the availability of goods and services to consumers in Ireland over the coming weeks. It indicates how important it is that this dispute is resolved immediately.</P>
      <P>It is critical that the Government starts to take this sector of the economy seriously. We should have a strategic overview of the importance of maintaining adequate and diverse sea transport links between Ireland and our trading partners. The Farrell Grant Sparks report identified this problem and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources knew of its content. I am very disappointed that he did not negotiate in Europe to get that exemption back in place. It may not have solved the problem, but we did not avail of that benefit although it operates in other jurisdictions. Why did the Minister not go back to Europe and reinstate a refund scheme for employer contributions of social costs &mdash; a facility that was in existence since 1997? The Government announced an extension of the scheme to November 2004, subject to EU approval, which was not sought. Why was it not sought? It is not in place at the moment. The Irish Maritime Development Office also prepared recommendations, but nothing was done about them either. The Government missed a golden opportunity when it did not avail of those two critical aspects, which could have helped to avert this major difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Ferries fiasco has caused serious unrest in County Wexford. Most people recognise that the Government has not been proactive on this issue. These problems have been<?oasys _jy?><Col N="70"/><?oasys _fc?>continuing for the past 12 months. I do not accept that the Government&rsquo;s hands are collectively tied on the re-flagging issue.</P>
      <P>I am shocked at the behaviour of the company in smuggling security men on the ships and having them change into uniform once they were at sea. I am highly critical of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s stance on this issue. This man has often boasted of his industrial relations skills when he was Minister for Labour. Those skills have now deserted him. Even at this late stage, I urge those involved to have a change of heart. My party leader called on the Taoiseach to gather all the players, knock heads together and to sort out this mess immediately. The company and the unions should now sit down with a blank sheet and come up with some form of agreement. The moves to replace Irish workers should be halted immediately. Following that, the unions should call a halt to their actions on board the ship and everyone should then sit down calmly and talk through the issues.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see Irish Ferries being lost to County Wexford and to Ireland. The Government has time to sort out the mess and I call on the Minister to do so immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the dispute at Irish Ferries: an issue which has such significant impacts for the travelling public, the workers in Irish Ferries and their families, Irish Ferries itself, exporters, importers, hauliers and many more people. It also has the potential to impact on the whole industrial relations environment, on the prospects for continued social partnership in Ireland and on the image of Ireland abroad as a stable location to invest and do business.</P>
      <P>I welcome the withdrawal earlier this afternoon by Irish Ferries of the security staff on the <i>Isle of Inishmore</i> and the <i>Ulysses</i> ferries. This should assist the process of engagement. I hope this will lead to a more positive climate for talks in the Labour Relations Commission. This matter, which we all recognise as being of major importance, is currently with the Labour Relations Commission. The commission is working with both parties to agree an agenda to allow the parties to engage in intensive negotiations over the next week. I am appalled at the approach taken by Irish Ferries in recent weeks to the conduct of industrial relations. In particular, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government have condemned the company&rsquo;s confrontational tactics which are not the way that business should be done. The orderly conduct of industrial relations depends on respect for the basic norms and for the institutions of the State, especially the Labour Court. While Labour Court recommendations are not generally binding, the fact is that they should be respected as the proper means to the resolution of disputes.</P><Col N="71"/>
      <P>This is especially the case with the Irish Ferries dispute. The court spelt out very carefully its views on fundamental aspects of negotiation and collective agreements. It upholds the basic principle that agreements should be honoured unless there are compelling reasons to vary them. In this case, having heard comprehensive arguments from both sides, the court concluded that the company had not made out a sufficiently compelling case to justify a unilateral termination of its agreement with SIPTU. However, the court went on to state that all possibilities of re-negotiating aspects of the agreement of concern to the company had not been exhausted. It was therefore recommended that the parties resume negotiations on such changes as are necessary in order to address the commercial needs of the company. Having regard to the clear risk to the conduct of ordinary industrial relations which the court stated would otherwise arise, the Government strongly urged the parties to enter into negotiations, with an independent facilitator if necessary. The issues in dispute between SIPTU and the company could have been resolved. It may still be possible to do so, but the company&rsquo;s tactics have not helped.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is considering an application by the company to transfer the vessels from the Irish register to the Cypriot register. He is doing so on the advice of the Attorney General and has sought further information on the strength of the relationship between Irish Ferries, the ships involved and Cyprus. The protection of employment standards is an important goal of public policy. We do not want to create a low wage economy here. In particular, we do not want to foster a social division by having jobs transformed from decent employment for Irish citizens to low pay positions targeted at migrant workers. This country has invested greatly in tackling poverty and inequality. The Government is not prepared to see it replaced by short-sighted and exploitative decisions. Ultimately, the State winds up subsidising unsustainable low paid employment through family income supplement, social services and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Tell that to Deputy Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I am satisfied that we have a realistic minimum wage here. The potential to re-flag in the maritime sector would appear to put the employment of seafarers beyond the minimum wage regime here. Therefore, directly comparable situations do not arise in other types of employment. However, there are issues arising from recent events which we all need to consider, including the arrangements for repayment of part of the cost of redundancy settlements to employers and the adequacy of our industrial relations framework in circumstances such as this. <Col N="72"/>Furthermore, I wish to make it clear that the Government did not agree to immediate access to the Irish labour market by citizens of the new member states in order to displace Irish workers. Having said that, I recognise that commercial reality and competitive pressures will impact on employment here which is not sustainable. The best defence for all of us against these pressures is to ensure that our approach to wage bargaining reflects competitive realities, that our workers are encouraged to update their skills in line with technical progress, that our industrial relations practices foster flexibility and change in order to boost productivity, and that our support for workers who are affected by change is timely and effective.</P>
      <P>There has been informal contact with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions following its decision to postpone the commencement of talks on a new social partnership agreement. Ministers and officials from a number of Departments, including my own, met ICTU representatives over recent weeks. The Taoiseach also met ICTU on these issues. This provided a useful opportunity to elaborate on the key issues and to ensure that there was at least a shared understanding of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the Government has already communicated its intention to engage fully and effectively in the process of devising policies and measures which would protect employment standards and arrest a race to the bottom in terms of employment practices. I am confident a successful response to these issues can be found for our economy, where the particular characteristics, legal and otherwise, of the marine sector do not apply. I believe they are best found within the context of a social partnership agreement which continues the stability and progressive modernisation of our labour force and employment practices in order to sustain jobs and living standards.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I view with great concern the potential social implications of the displacement of workers on established conditions in favour of those willing to do the same jobs on much poorer conditions. The Taoiseach is on record in stating that we want to see greater productivity and enhanced competitiveness based on new products and services, improving staff skills, new work practices and technological innovation. We do not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other poor compliance practices. Not only is it wrong, it is not sustainable.</P>
      <P>It would be useful if I addressed an accusation being made by Deputy Rabbitte and others that there is some connection between the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent statement as regards the scope for action by the Government and Irish Ferries&rsquo; outrageous behaviour.</P>

	<P>I understand the Taoiseach has already made clear to the Deputy that he was aware on the weekend before last that within trade union circles, it was expected the company would proceed in the immediate future to begin implementation of its plan. Last week&rsquo;s action was clearly planned in a careful and covert way and we can therefore assume it was planned long before any remarks made by the Taoiseach.

      <P>I will set the context for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks. They referred to the fact that, in the unique circumstances of the law relating to the marine sector, it would not be possible to enforce Irish employment terms and conditions on re-flagged vessels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, it would be in breach of its duties under the Treaty of the European Community. Once Irish Ferries satisfies the Minister that its proposed re-flagging in Cyprus is on foot of its right of establishment, the State cannot prevent the re-flagging. That is the stark reality.</P>
      <P>Pending that re-flagging approval, Irish employment laws will continue to be enforced and at all times Irish safety laws will continue to apply to all vessels using Irish ports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>However, once the vessels re-flag in Cyprus it is clear, as a matter of international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, that the terms and conditions of the employed seafarers on such vessels is to be decided exclusively by the flag state, which in this case will be Cyprus. Moreover, it is crystal clear that the State cannot prevent a re-flagging that occurs as an integral part of exercising a right of establishment in another member state.</P>
      <P>The Government has been advised that the attempt to do so through the terms of the Bill tabled by the Labour Party would be completely ineffectual and legally unsustainable.</P>

	<P>Once a right of establishment in accordance with European law is exercised, by definition, there would be a genuine link with the member state in which the vessel is re-flagged. Hence the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposed Bill will not <Col N="75"/>solve the problem. In fact, it will compound the situation by unfairly raising expectations of a legislative solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We offered to share our analysis of the legal position with the representatives of SIPTU and I understand this took place last Friday evening.</P>
      <P>It serves no purpose to provide the illusion of a solution which is not available. Equally, I reject the suggestion that the deplorable circumstances in Irish Ferries can be repeated in other sectors of the workforce. This is, as Members know, not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

	<P>I ask Deputy Stagg to allow the Minister to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish labour law and Irish regulations can and will be applied to workers from other member states, or from outside the European Community. Furthermore, the Taoiseach has signalled publicly and in direct discussion with the trade union movement, that we are prepared to strengthen the provisions to secure employment protection in the Irish labour market and to engage fully with them in that regard. As I have already indicated, there have been useful discussions at political and official level already in that respect.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt about the position of the Government. It deplores the behaviour of the management of Irish Ferries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interests of the wider social and industrial relations environment, a negotiated solution should still be sought and we are determined that effective protection of employment standards will apply.</P><Col N="76"/>
      <P>Finally, we believe that this is best secured within the context of social partnership. As the House debates this issue, the Labour Relations Commission continues its deliberations in the hope of finding a basis and process by which the parties can move forward. I do not want to say anything further at this point, except to wish the commission success in its complex task and to encourage both sides to engage in earnest, given what each of them and this country have to lose if they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Broughan and perhaps the Chair might inform me when my time has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an extraordinary situation, underscored by the fact that I understand this to be the first debate of its kind since the foot and mouth crisis threatened our entire economic well-being. That issue united the country and I believe there is now extraordinary attention on this issue, well beyond the focus of a mere industrial dispute. What is happening? Why, as the Minister informed the House, is our economic well-being under threat? The ability to move some 30% of our imports and exports, the capacity of industry to supply itself and to move its goods off this island and the stability of social partnership itself are threatened. They are threatened because a single, maverick company has taken it upon itself, unilaterally, to demolish 20 years of social partnership and to ignore the well-functioning, well-constructed and highly respected labour relations institutions which have been carefully crafted to solve issues on the basis of partnership and mutual respect. They are threatened because one company has decided the success we have achieved in respect of partnership is to be set aside and that its greedy objectives can only be achieved on the basis of conflict, rather than partnership.</P>
      <P>What has the Government&rsquo;s response been? The Government has stated it can do nothing. The Taoiseach said as much last week. Perhaps, as the Minister has suggested to the House, it is entirely coincidental that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s declaration of impotence coincided with the company&rsquo;s action to send in so-called security personnel to intimidate workers. This was the first time for decades that such actions have been seen in any industrial relations dispute. Thankfully, as the House has been informed, those security personnel have been removed. Finally perhaps, the voice of reason has even reached the ears of that company&rsquo;s board of directors.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Government is impotent. I believe it is not trying. What can it do? The leader of the Labour Party indicated our international rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. He informed this House that there is a requirement under Article 91 of that <Col N="77"/>convention, to which this State, every other member state of the European Union, as well as the European Union itself as an entity, are all parties. It is an internationally binding treaty which states that a genuine link must exist between the state whose flag a ship flies and the ship itself. The Minister has indicated, as did the Taoiseach previously, that because of European treaty requirements that allow for the right of establishment in another member state, we are impotent to act under Article 91. We reject that. If there is a will to do it, we can certainly argue that the treaties of the European Union cannot be used to undermine the clear intention of the UN convention, to which we are signatories.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is amusing that the Government feigns impotence in respect of an issue of such critical importance given that it can act unilaterally regarding other matters. For example, we allowed workers from the newly acceded states free access to work in Ireland from 1 May 2004 but we unilaterally decided not to give them access to social welfare benefits for two years. This is being challenged in the European courts. I am not saying it is a good or bad decision but it is one we decided for ourselves. Members on this side of the House are now demanding that the Government show the same robustness in this case and not allow the company to reflag its vessels. If Irish Ferries wants to take us to the European Court of Justice, so be it &mdash; we will defend the rights of the workers. We certainly have a very arguable position if the Government has any bottle or is willing to prevent reflagging and take a stand that the company&rsquo;s actions are unconscionable.</P>
      <P>I was on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night and the nation was shocked by the views expressed by a distinguished economist. They are resonant of a view prevailing in some economic circles in this city and country to the effect that we are somehow moving towards the ultra-liberal position where workers are not partners in building an economy but rather tools to be manipulated, discarded and utilised at will. That will not wash with the people of Ireland, including the workers.</P>
      <P>It is not true, as the Minister indicated, that this case does not apply to other areas of employment because we have noted that it does in cases that have arisen in our clinics. I do not know whether the Minister has noted it but he should because he is the Minister responsible for employment. In the construction industry, sectoral agreements are being set aside and people are expected to work for all the 48 hours to which they are entitled at a flat-rate minimum wage. Workers who have built up a package of entitlements are being told they can pack their bags if they do not like the conditions that obtain and that they will be displaced with people who are prepared to work on the minimum wage.</P><Col N="78"/>
      <P>This is a defining moment for the State. We have built economic success and come close to full employment but the next phase of our economic development will either continue the good practices of respecting all the actors in social partnership or will be built on a maverick form of exploitation which now seems to have currency. There are too many people watching from the sidelines to see how this will pan out. My final call is to IBEC and the employers, who need to take a stand on one side or another of this argument. If the social partnership model of respect, operating through the institutions we have established in the State to resolve matters of dispute, is not the way forward, we will enter an era of conflict in which people are dismissed and regarded as mere cogs.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the crocodile tears and hand-wringing we have noted on the part of Members on the Government benches, including a succession of Ministers, they are complicit in allowing this dismantling to happen.</P>

	<P>It is astonishing that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment can deliver a speech within which there is not a single proposal to address the horrific circumstances facing the workers of Irish Ferries on the <i>Isle of Inisfree</i> and <i>Ulysses</i>. He has the absolute cheek to ask the labour movement for a new social partnership deal when 543 workers have been threatened, abused and frightened. Their families were in tears some weeks ago when they were trying to decide whether to accept redundancy and sell their own jobs. The labour movement has not faced such disgraceful events since 1912 and 1913 when our great predecessors protested over the activities of similar thugs who tried to intimidate the working people of this city.</P>

	<P>Many would say the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has totally abandoned the Irish Ferries workers and is guilty of an appalling dereliction of duty on foot of his comment that there was no more he could do. Shrugging his shoulders and holding up his hands, he gave the green light to these outrageous events.</P>

	<P>I have received many reports from former work colleagues regarding the officers stranded on board the two vessels. They have had the highest praise for the professionalism and competence of the officers, who have dedicated themselves to what is often a tough and difficult job with long stretches away from home and family. They do not deserve to be treated <Col N="79"/>with such thuggery and contempt by their employers.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries officials entered the <i>Isle of Inisfree</i> with a gang of so-called security personnel, allegedly from a north County Dublin firm, and gave no warning to the captain of the ship, who is ultimately responsible for the security and safety of everyone on board. Some years after the events of 11 September 2001, and just a few months after a major security disaster in London, can one believe that they would act in such an illegal and outrageous manner &mdash; in an almost terrorist-type manner?</P>
      <P>I have received allegations from family and close friends of the workers, and from many of our SIPTU and International Transport Federation colleagues on board the <i>Isle of Inisfree</i>, that they saw metal bars and crowbars in the luggage of the so-called &ldquo;security personnel&rdquo; that were brought on board. For this reason, I contacted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, early on Friday on behalf of the workers and asked him to request the Irish ambassador to the United Kingdom, Daith&iacute;&Oacute; Ceallaigh, to travel immediately to Pembroke to try to ensure the safety of our citizen workers on the vessels. I have also contacted the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Chief Superintendent Noel White at Harcourt Square regarding what I believe were criminal actions on the part of the management of Irish Ferries. What are the results of this investigation?</P>
      <P>We have read reports in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> about even more outrageous plans involving the use of tear gas, which plans have been referred to earlier today. The managing director of Irish Ferries, Mr. Eamon Rothwell, wrote in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning about so-called black propaganda that is being issued against his company. However, his article is a tissue of disingenuous and even blacker propaganda. Almost every point therein is a direct contravention of the truth. He states that independent examination of the company&rsquo;s books by Farrell Grant Sparks, the consultants nominated by SIPTU, verified the kinds of outrageous cutbacks he wanted to implement. The exact opposite is the case. The report stated that the existing agreement should have extended to 2007.</P>
      <P>Mr. Rothwell also refers to crews from eastern Europe receiving pay in real terms that is &ldquo;30% higher than on-land Irish minimum wages&rdquo;. This is a complete joke given that workers are working in virtually slave-ship conditions, with four months on and so-called four months off. Mr. Rothwell refers to his company, Irish Ferries, standing on its own two feet. What about the &euro;3 million in tonnage tax that this State gave to the company to sustain it? What about the PRSI concessions given to his company? Has the Minister not got a duty to tell us this evening what will <Col N="80"/>happen to the significant subventions the State gives Irish Ferries on an ongoing basis?</P>

	<P>Given that budget day is next week, does he not have an obligation to tell us what will happen?</P>
      <P>Mr. Rothwell has the cheek to refer to the labour relations mechanisms and state the company has been back and forth to the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and the national implementation body. The direct opposite is the truth because it was he who told all those involved in the labour relations mechanisms to go to hell and that he had enough of them. He begins his article with such a quote. His behaviour has been outrageous and disgraceful and his article is a tissue of lies.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is directly responsible for this impasse. Instead of wringing his hands, he should have taken action on some of the fiscal and other matters I have mentioned. He had the opportunity to use our labour Bill, the Mercantile Marine (Avoidance of Flags of Convenience) Bill, to draw a line through an international convention. Our advice is that it is perfectly legal. We could pass that Bill this evening before this session ends, just as he passed the commercial property Bill some months ago to protect our property. Let us protect our workers. They are surely as valuable as our property. Let us pass the Labour Party mercantile marine Bill and make reflagging impossible.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is personally responsible for this. For six years he had the opportunity to do something in Europe when the ferries directive was being discussed. The directive would have obliged shipping companies to adhere to the pay and conditions applicable in the countries between which the companies&rsquo; ships were sailing, that is, France or Ireland or Britain. Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, including the former Ministers, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke and Deputy Woods, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, were among a cabal of right-wing European Ministers who stopped that proposal when it was discussed between 1998 and 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>This Irish Ferries debacle is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that the company is displacing hard working, committed and long-standing workers simply to make an even greater profit than that which it already makes. It is a disgrace that the company has torn up last year&rsquo;s agreement with SIPTU and the Irish Seamen&rsquo;s Union and thrown out the Labour Court decision of 14 November, which states that there is no compelling case for it to seek to break that agreement.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The actions of the company last week in putting on board the ships stormtroopers from a company specialising in global terrorism to enforce a new regime on Irish workers were disgraceful. To deploy such overtly military personnel, who may well have been armed, is a disgrace. The treatment of agency workers who are currently on board the <i>MV Normandy</i> and those who will be on other ships in the future is a disgrace. However, the biggest disgrace is the inaction of the Government. What does the Taoiseach say? He says he can do nothing. He throws up his hands as if he were an unemployed person walking up O&rsquo;Connell Street in the afternoon. Somebody should tap him on the shoulder and say, &ldquo;Bertie, you are Taoiseach of this bloody State. You are the guy in charge. How can you do nothing about it?&rdquo; Of course, we know the answer. The Taoiseach does not have the will to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>This matter is not just about Irish Ferries. It is about the type of society and standards we want. As a senior trade unionist put it at a recent meeting, we need a threshold of decency. That threshold should ensure that poor people will get proper services and proper terms and conditions of employment. Irrespective of what Ministers say, the buck stops with the Taoiseach but he is not doing anything about this matter.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries has effectively declared war on the rights and conditions workers have gained over many years. If the company is allowed to proceed in this way, the floodgates will open. Some Ministers say that this issue is peculiar to Irish Ferries. That is not the case and everybody on both sides of the House knows it. They are only trying to put up a smokescreen to gain time. They should not be allowed to get away with it.</P>
      <P>Displaced workers and their replacements, namely, migrant workers, who are subject to low <Col N="82"/>rates of pay and exploitative working conditions, are now a feature of how the labour force in this State is to operate. It is time to say that enough is enough. I hope there will be a mass mobilisation in support of the day of action on 9 December. I hope people come out and make it clear to the Government and everybody involved that inaction is not good enough. The wink and nod attitude to the management to proceed with this action is unacceptable. I ask people to begin preparing for that day of mobilisation.</P>
      <P>The true face of the neoliberal agenda being pursued by the current Government was laid bare on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme on RTE last night by the economist, Dan McLoughlin. He said what the Government thinks but will not say.</P>

I hope the people of the State will give the Government their reaction on 9 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members, I condemn the SAS-type bully boy tactics of Irish Ferries at the weekend. Thankfully, the company came to its senses to some extent this afternoon and withdrew the so-called security personnel from the vessels. The antics of Irish Ferries are reminiscent of the William Martin Murphys of the Dublin lock-out of 1913. I hope the day of action on 9 December encourages this company to take on board the views of ordinary decent people and of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery.</P>
      <P>We have heard some Members call on the Taoiseach to knock heads together and to resolve this matter. However, only one set of heads needs to be knocked together, that is, the heads of the managers of Irish Ferries, a maverick company that has been involved in disgraceful and unscrupulous conduct in recent months. If they are allowed to get away with this, every unscrupulous employer in the country will want to do the same. Unfortunately, even decent employers will be forced to consider using similar tactics because they will be undermined by unscrupulous companies paying little or no wages and providing poor work conditions.</P>
      <P>This issue goes to the heart of Irish society. Everyone is challenged either to be on the side of decency and social justice or that of thuggery and the law of the jungle, as espoused by Irish Ferries. I call on the Taoiseach to introduce emergency legislation immediately to stop the <Col N="83"/>reflagging of these ships and to ensure that Irish Ferries workers are paid Irish wages and given Irish conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach raised the white flag of surrender last week, it was, of course, the starting flag for Irish Ferries management to implement its union busting, bullying tactics that are reminiscent of the employers of 1913 when they set out to strangle the trade union movement in its infancy. Irish Ferries workers and employees in general in this country can expect from this Government just as much as it has done to date with regard to Irish Ferries &mdash; absolutely nothing effective. Workers will find a resolution in their own power, however, and will demonstrate it to Irish Ferries and all those employers who are silently cheering on Irish Ferries because they want to engage in super-profiteering at the expense of migrant labour.</P>
      <P>The national day of action on Friday, 9 December, called by the trade union movement should, with the exception of the provision of essential services, be elevated to a one-day national work stoppage. Massive demonstrations should accompany that one-day national strike. That is how the great men and women who founded the labour movement &mdash; including great working class fighters such as Connolly and Larkin &mdash; to deal with employers of this nature would have met this challenge. That is how they would have met the greed-driven employers who are intent on driving workers&rsquo; wages and living conditions back to the dark ages. A national work stoppage would be a shot across the bows of Irish Ferries and employers. It would also be a warning to the Government that it should stop Irish Ferries in its tracks and a signal that any employer that takes a similar road of exploiting labour will be met with an equally robust challenge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is often said that we in Ireland live in an open economy and that ours is among the most open trading economies in the world. In many ways we have benefited from this because we have enjoyed large revenues and much success as a result of companies establishing operations here. The difficulty and risk of operating in such an open market is that we are subject to the vagaries of international capitalism moving from one location to another.</P>
      <P>In this case, the damning issue is that we are not speaking of a company based elsewhere. Irish Ferries is not based in the United States, nor is it making a decision to leave Ireland for another country because of a marginal gain in its bottom line. This company&rsquo;s directors, board and shareholders are predominantly based in this country. A clear message should go out tonight to the directors and management of this company. The actions they have taken and the methods they have chosen, along with the motives and morals exhibited, are shameful. The message should be that every individual party and politician in this House agrees that the company&rsquo;s behaviour is shameful.</P>
      <P>The behaviour to which I refer threatens not only the future success of the company and the jobs of its current employees but also the character and development of the economy, given that it operates in an open and obvious way. Those directors, who are human beings, are no doubt standing this week at some social function or other, looking down at well-pressed trousers and tidy shoes, but they should not raise their heads and should not be able to carry on as if what they have done is a normal part of business activity, nor should they think that it is always about the bottom line. If we exist in such an open economy in a competitive world, that culture can only lead to a loss of all standards and instances where the bottom line replaces any other motive or measure for what is done or not. I say directly to the company directors and the Minister that such a culture is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>There has been ineptitude on the part of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il in terms <Col N="85"/>of taking action in respect of this matter. As Deputy Broughan stated, there was a repeated failure to introduce or support relevant European legislation that could offer protection. The bigger issue is that, for the past eight years under this Government, there has been a two-tier society which encourages enterprise but which does so in the context that nothing else matters. This message directed at employers and directors has led to Irish Ferries believing that its actions are acceptable and accepted practice in modern Ireland. Its inaction and inability to see the seriousness of this issue is a problem and will be a legacy of this Government.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers in that what the Minister has presented tonight is another case that nothing can be done and that it is up to the Labour Relations Commission or other industrial authorities. That is not acceptable. We expect the Minister to investigate what is possible in the European arena or through domestic legislation. I do not, and neither should the House, accept that the simple measure of moving to a flag of convenience in Cyprus means that vessels that are effectively owned here, that enter and leave Irish ports every day and that depend on Irish services and port facilities to operate can function in a manner which has nothing to do with Cyprus and everything to do with Ireland. I refuse to accept that European legislation and regulations mean that, in these circumstances, we can do nothing and are dependent on what the country of the flag of convenience stipulates or does.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have been given a list of the directors of Irish Ferries. These are the chairman, Mr. McGuckian, Mr. Peter Crowley, Mr. Bernard Somers, Mr. Rothwell, Mr. O&rsquo;Dea and Mr. Kelly. They have questions to answer in terms of what is emanating from this debate. That applies, in particular, to the directors of the company who are setting this long-term strategy. We should respond to today&rsquo;s issue with one voice. The actions of the directors and the means by which they are operating are shameful, disgraceful and unacceptable. The company should operate successfully but on the basis of certain minimum wage and other conditions set by the Legislature. It is not acceptable for a company to attempt to ride roughshod over this Government and this Legislature, which sets the standards which should apply in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank everybody who contributed to the debate. I have some questions which could elicit information from the Minister that he did not include in his contribution. The Minister is aware that there has been a &euro;51 million investment in the Ringaskiddy college for Irish seafarers. With the loss of one major employer in the <Col N="86"/>sector, where will these seafarers find employment? Will the investment be worthwhile?</P>
      <P>The Government has, for some time, been in possession of a report, commissioned by Farrell Grant Sparks 18 months ago, which contains issues relating to Irish Ferries but about which it has done nothing. The Irish Maritime Development Office reviewed the sector&rsquo;s State aids and recommended their implementation three years ago. However, the Government did nothing about this. Is it fair to state that the Government has been aware of all problems associated with seafaring and working conditions in Irish Ferries for up to three years and has done nothing to deal with the matter?</P>
      <P>Has the Government paid its portion of the redundancy obligations to Irish Ferries workers on the <i>MV Normandy</i>? How much has been paid? Are there any plans to revisit the matter? Has the Minister made any approach to his EU counterparts to develop a policy for a co-ordinated approach to proper employment standards across all sectors in the European Union, particularly in the country to which reference was made? Difficulties could arise from being an island nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, will also deal with issues relating to the maritime sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the &euro;51 million investment in the maritime college, it is a state-of-the-art facility in Ringaskiddy. The Government made the investment to enable the facility to train future seafarers and become a centre of excellence where we could contract in other interests from outside the State to be trained. It was a worthwhile investment of which we are particularly proud. It will continue to make a significant contribution to training and education matters pertaining to maritime issues.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate, there seems to be a unified position in the House that the behaviour of the management of Irish Ferries is reprehensible and wrong. We should adhere to this position and ensure that, at the least, it emanates from the House as a clear message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What will the Minister do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>To somehow require the Government to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;suggest that the Taoiseach is responsible for this, which was suggested in some <Col N="87"/>contributions. That is fanciful, farcical and has no reality in the context of what has transpired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is historically accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If any Member of the House has made a significant contribution through the years to the improvement of workers&rsquo; rights in the context of social partnership, which is a unique model from which Ireland has benefited significantly, it is the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>As an agreement, social partnership has been fundamentally responsible for the advancement of workers&rsquo; rights, social conditions and social programmes and has led to a consensus approach between unions, employers, the Government and all parties to advance the social agenda in this country. I assure the House that the Taoiseach remains committed to improving and enhancing that agenda, to closing any gaps that may open because of globalisation or otherwise, to continuing to copper-fasten the protection of employment rights and to ensuring compliance with labour law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan stated we had a cheek to call on people to engage in social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not behaving like a partner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I and the Government passionately believe that these issues are best resolved in terms of the protection of labour and employment standards, and that social partnership offers us the best opportunity to achieve this in the coming weeks and months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should kiss it goodbye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the best way to do it. To suggest we kiss it goodbye would be to undermine the rights of workers. We have opportunities to protect the rights of workers in the context of social partnership.</P>

	<P>It was &euro;1.1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We did that under a certain set of circumstances and certain terms of propositions advanced by the company and the unions, which agreed at the time in those particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What were the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They were the circumstances advanced in terms of the discontinuation of the service, as then advanced by Irish Ferries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not discontinued.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and subsequently broken.</P>
      <P>With regard to the legal position, we are satisfied that the set of circumstances applied to the <i>MV Normandy</i> was separate to that which now applies. As I indicated, we have not yet received a redundancy notice from Irish Ferries in regard to the current situation. I have taken legal advice from the Attorney General. I have indicated publicly that the preliminary advice on the current situation is that it does not appear a legitimate redundancy scenario, although that is subject to more detailed analysis if we receive a redundancy notice from the company.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, to deal with the maritime issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am here to answer questions, I condemn in the strongest possible fashion the activities of Irish Ferries on Thursday evening last.</P>
      <P>I had responsibility for and agreed to the flagging out of the <i>MV Normandy</i>. I did not take that decision lightly. I had meetings at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us establish the facts. I did not take that decision lightly. I met the union representatives and representatives from Irish Ferries. Given the vulnerability of the situation between Ireland and mainland Europe at that time, I took the view that it was necessary to take the decision. However, I was given a very strong <Col N="89"/>assurance by the company that this would not in any way, then or in the future, affect the situation on the Irish Sea routes. I am disappointed at the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Disappointed. They lied to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the situation which was made clear to me at the time. If I did this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That was months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it was a number of months ago. I first heard of the decision to offer an attractive redundancy package some ten minutes before it was announced in the media, and I heard it third or fourth hand. While I did not have to be told, as the line Minister I could have been advised in advance and could possibly have entered into negotiations or discussions at that time.</P>
      <P>On 12 October I met David Begg and the union representatives from SIPTU and the Seamen&rsquo;s Union of Ireland, who made a number of suggestions to me. The following day I met my colleague, the Minister of State responsible for labour affairs, and pursued some of those suggestions, but with no success.</P>
      <P>I met last Wednesday evening with the representative of Irish Ferries. I made clear to him my disappointment at the company&rsquo;s attitude, given that the company had provided an assurance that there would not be a problem on the Irish Sea in the future. I asked him when the company might be subject to flagging out, which my legal advisers have not yet clarified can be done. The day may come when I will have no option but to accept this approach, but I must have all the facts at my disposal. I posed the question to the Irish Ferries representative with regard to the transition that might take place but I was not even afforded the courtesy of being told it was taking place within 24 hours. The House can fully appreciate my attitude when I was not even advised on the matter. I might not have been able to do anything about it but I certainly would have given advice on what should be done, and that common sense should prevail. I hope it will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with some care to the Minister&rsquo;s speech. If Article 91 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which concerns the requirement to have a direct connection between the ship and the state, does not apply in this case, why did the Minister tell the House that the Attorney General is seeking information from Irish Ferries about that connection? Either they are seeking it in a sham way to fool the workers or the Labour Party analysis, which the party leader and I put to the House earlier, is correct, namely, Article 91 does apply, there must be a connection between the vessel and the flag and we can oppose the reflagging.</P><Col N="90"/>
      <P>If the Government can take unilateral action to safeguard social welfare payments, which at the end of the day involve money, and take its chances subsequently with a determination in the European Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy repeat that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government could take unilateral action last year to ensure that social welfare resources were protected by denying new member states&rsquo; citizens the right to claim social welfare here for two years, despite the fact this may breach European law, why can it not act unilaterally, and take its chances in the European Court with a clear, stateable case, to safeguard Irish workers, social partnership and decent standards of industrial relations?</P>
      <P>I expect a direct answer to my next question. Has the Taoiseach raised this issue this week at the EU-Mediterranean Summit, when the Heads of Government of all the member states are present with him? What was their response? What is the attitude of Government to the EU directive on manning conditions that it shamefully voted down last year? Will it at this late stage revisit the directive, support it and build a consensus so that decent standards apply on all ferries operating in the Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>EU law is very clear on the issue of re-flagging and the right of establishment. There is a process to follow when an application is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Deputy asked a question to which I am giving a specific answer. The Attorney General has advised the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on processing the application. I have outlined the realities of the situation once the connection is established. The company is outlining issues regarding the connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Bahamas turned down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>EU law is very clear on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister make it clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not comparable to the Deputy&rsquo;s points about social welfare and the decision we took on EU migrants coming into the country. The law is very clear on the right to re-establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Attorney General asking for flags in that connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We decided, above and beyond any other country apart from the United <Col N="91"/>Kingdom, to allow migrant labourers come in on social welfare.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a side issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised it. On that issue the Commission has challenged us. That decision cannot be compared to reflagging and so forth. The Taoiseach informally raised with other EU leaders the issues pertaining to the Irish Ferries experience. I have not received a formal report from the Taoiseach about the EU-Mediterranean Summit. This issue was not formally on the agenda but he has had informal discussions with other European leaders about how we might move on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the EU directive on manning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows the history of the EU manning directive. As a result of my meeting with David Begg, SIPTU and the Seamen&rsquo;s Union of Ireland I asked the European Commission about its intentions regarding the possible reintroduction of that directive. It may take some time but the clock must start ticking.</P>
      <P>The Commission indicated it had no plans to introduce a similar directive. I will attend a marine transport meeting in Europe next week where I will speak with my colleagues and impress the need for this upon them. I took the opportunity when I was in the United Kingdom some weeks ago to discuss this issue with Mr. Ladyman, the Minister of State at the Department for Transport with responsibility for marine transport, because this will be a problem for the United Kingdom too.</P>
      <P>As a result of my meeting with David Begg and the other representatives I considered entering into some form of tripartite agreement with the United Kingdom and the French authorities. The initial legal advice I received, however, indicates that organising such bilateral or trilateral agreements could be exceedingly complex, quite lengthy and may not help to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>The International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s consolidated maritime labour convention, which was mentioned at our meeting, unfortunately does not apply to rates of pay. In short, I support putting a new directive on the agenda and will take the initiative in consultation, even informally with the French and UK Ministers, next week. I have already flagged this with the UK Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister struck by the nauseating double standards in many sections of the print media, especially Independent Newspapers, in their coverage of the sending of bully boys onto Irish Ferries ships? This has been <Col N="92"/>reported in the most sedate language. Has the Minister contrasted that with the paroxysms of fury in Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s title, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, when it vilified groups of workers such as those in the ESB and An Post who had to resort to some mild industrial action to defend their interests? The same title has an inglorious history in the events of 1913.</P>
      <P>Is this contrast due to the number of blue chip capitalists, including leading bankers, and a director of Independent Newspapers, who sit on the parent board of Irish Ferries? Does the Minister agree this suggests that big business strategists as a whole are in favour of Irish Ferries&rsquo; neo-liberal policy of driving down wages and conditions?</P>
      <P>Since workers can now expect little from this Government, the Minister and the Taoiseach having thrown their hands up in the air, does the Minister join the call of the trade union movement on working people in their greatest numbers to demonstrate on 9 December? Will he encourage them to leave work to show this company that workers&rsquo; power can stop it in its exploitation plans, even if the Government cannot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that under social partnership major penalties apply to trade unions which do not comply with the terms of that agreement? Does he accept that IBEC members suffer no such penalties for breaches of agreement? Workers therefore depend completely on the Minister and the Government to protect them which it is not doing for the workers on Irish Ferries. Does he accept too that this issue goes beyond Irish Ferries and if the company is allowed to get away with this action the standards of Irish workers will virtually collapse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister have a signed deal on the reflagging of the <i>MV Normandy</i> in regard to the future plans of the company? Was giving that concession not the green light for other operators to take that derogation? What type of deal was in place?</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister not act on State aids in respect of the Irish Maritime Development Office? Why was no action taken when the Farrell Grant Sparks report stated it was a mistake to reflag the <i>MV Normandy</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Who said that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No one said anything about any mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it should be revisited. Why did the Government sit on the report for 18 months without taking any action on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is much easier to be an historian than a forecaster and there are some good <Col N="93"/>historians around. This was done in good faith and the unions were fully aware of this. I respect the unions because this was a difficult issue for them at the time, led by Paul Smith of SIPTU. I admired the unions for their practical and pragmatic approach. There was no question of any signed deal in this issue. It was done in good faith, given the assurances that this would sustain the position on the Irish Sea. If it was wrong, so be it.</P>
      <P>I advocate State aid for the shipping sector, not sweetheart deals with any company. This is not exclusive to Ireland. The Commission advocates State aid whether it be a unique income tax allowance available to seafarers working at sea for 160 days a year. The tonnage tax is not in place only for Irish Ferries but for all involved in that business. We were asked many times about the PRSI of employers of seafarers and my predecessors had to go back to Europe but we have finally secured approval for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week. It goes back to 1 January 2004. All companies will benefit from that approval. This is a difficult business within Europe. If there was no flagging out to the Bahamas and elsewhere the companies might not be on the same footing. I seek a level playing pitch. I am anxious to put this in place and the Commission approved the employers of seafarers PRSI refund scheme. I indicated it on Wednesday evening to the representative of the Seamen&rsquo;s Union of Ireland. If that would have resolved the problem, it would have done so on Wednesday night. I would have felt guilty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is an important message to come from the House. It will also uphold the value of the industrial relations machinery in place to protect workers&rsquo; rights. Both parties, employers and workers, must uphold and honour the outcome of the labour relations machinery, be it the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>Some rhetoric has been used in the House to position the Taoiseach as the cause of the problem. Deputy Joe Higgins is equally guilty of utilising rhetoric as fanciful and farcical in his accusations against the media.</P>

	<P>By and large, the media supports the continuation of social partnership. There will always be balances and emphasis and positions will be taken by respective media organs where the outcome of any social partnership agreement should rest in dealing with competitiveness and the challenges of globalisation.</P>
      <P>The Government has not thrown its hands in the air. Deputy Morgan asked if the Government is fearful that this dispute will go beyond Irish Ferries into other sectors of the economy. The one way we can prevent it from doing so is to ensure the compliance regime for labour law is adequate and that through social partnership arrangements are put in place to further enhance the regime. The Government has indicated to the unions and employers that it is flexible, in terms of the modalities that may be applied, to ensure no reduction in employment standards and pay conditions in the broader economy. The Government has worked too hard to build up the living standards of workers to have them reduced.</P>

	<P>Is it not true that the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government has maintained a culture of support for the race to the bottom, as seen in Irish Ferries? Is it not true the Government opposed the EU ferries directive last year? Will the Government now support the directive? Is it not true the Government supported this type of action by Irish Ferries with the <i>MV Normandy</i> last year? Is it not true the Government supported the services directive, effectively a charter for this type of race to the bottom? Is it not true the Taoiseach kept his mouth shut while his EU Commissioner supported a similar action in Sweden by a Latvian company? There has been a deafening silence on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s part on this matter. Will the Minister support the day of action by Irish workers against Irish Ferries on 9 December?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister responsible for the implementation of the Companies Acts, have the fitness to practise provisions been examined regarding the directors of Irish Ferries? These are executive and non-executive directors who have stood idly by and witnessed acts of intimidation, possible uses of violence and threats to use tear gas. If the Companies Acts do not include these matters in the fitness to practise provisions, will they be included in the forthcoming review of the Acts?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has experienced difficulties in reaching trilateral agreements with Britain and France. However, the Treaty of Nice, although some of us voted against it, includes the provision of enhanced co-operation to secure agreement between member states in a situation which is above EU law. If the Government has not examined these provisions, it is not doing its job.</P>

	<P>Regarding complaints to the Garda about the outrageous methods that were used against Irish Ferries workers in Irish ports, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform inform the Minister if there is an ongoing Garda investigation? The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, have contradictory views on reflagging. Did the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment turn down a request by Irish Ferries to reflag in the Bahamas? Cyprus is the new proposed flag state which is on the register of flags of convenience. It is incumbent that such reflagging is not allowed, regardless of the EU position.</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party&rsquo;s mercantile marine Bill is introduced into the House, is it true the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, would vote against it while Fianna F&aacute;il would support it?

        <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cuffe, Boyle, Finian McGrath and Morgan.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the attendance of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I present the Climate Change Targets Bill 2005 in the understanding that it is in the interests of every Deputy and party in this House to address what is increasingly regarded as the most important and daunting challenge mankind has ever faced. The Green Party seeks to secure all-party agreement on the basic principles on which Ireland will address this challenge. These principles are glaringly clear. Ireland needs to set a long-term target for achieving the dramatic change the scientific community has indicated will be necessary to tackle climate change. We then need to make a clear commitment via annual, incremental reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to ensure we meet our long-term targets. We must embrace the new, low carbon future, rather than hide from it, as we and many other countries are currently doing.</P>
        <P>The launch of the Bill coincides with the opening of negotiations in Montreal on the United Nations framework on climate change. While the talks are set to continue for several years, they will be crucial in determining what collective agreement can be reached by governments across the world to replace the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012. It is not an exaggeration to say the outcome of the negotiations, successful or otherwise, will determine the future of mankind. The importance of this debate is that Deputies have an opportunity to recognise the significance of climate change.</P>
        <P>The evidence of how polluting activity by humans is producing climate change is presented in ever more stark forms, particularly by members of the scientific community. We need to express this evidence in language lay people can understand. We must be honest with people by recognising that climate change threatens the lives of our children and grandchildren. For many people around the world, this threat has already arrived. The poorest 2 billion people on the planet live in close proximity to nature, on which they are dependent for food, heating and homes. These people are increasingly vulnerable to changes in nature which take place as the climate <Col N="99"/>changes. They do not have an easy escape and cannot buy their way out of the problem.</P>
        <P>The World Health Organisation has already estimated that 150,000 people per annum are killed as a result of ongoing climate change and 10 million per annum are dislocated by creeping environmental degradation. We cannot ignore this reality. The longer term threats are much more dramatic. Glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating. For example, the glacier from which Edmund Hillary set out to reach Mount Everest has shrunk by three miles since he made his climb. This could be construed as a simple curiosity were it not for the fact that the lives of hundreds of millions of people in China and the Indian sub-continent are dependent on the waters from the Himalayan glaciers which are threatened by further glacial retreat.</P>
        <P>The annual 8% decline in the Arctic ice shield could also provide amazing curiosities. For example, this summer, for the first time, a boat was able to sail to the North Pole without the assistance of an ice breaker. If, however, we allow climate change to become a catastrophic runaway event, it will no longer be a curiosity but a threat to our existence. In such circumstances, we will be exposed to flooding or the potential that the Gulf Stream will be switched off. The sooner we recognise this threat and its only solution &mdash; immediate and radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions &mdash; the better. To achieve this, we must initiate the measures set out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Sections 2 and 3 contain simple provisions requiring Ireland to take part in international negotiations. The Bill is part of a process under which we would send the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to Montreal to deliver a message that Ireland is willing to try to lead the international community and that it recognises that, as one of the most polluting countries in the world on a <i>per capita</i> basis, it has an obligation to address climate change. In advance of the negotiations, Ireland must indicate a willingness to make its contribution and change its ways. These sections also set out Ireland&rsquo;s willingness to make commitments at international negotiations on the basis that all countries participate and the outcome is fair and equitable.</P>
        <P>Section 4 sets out in greater detail how Ireland would make reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This would be achieved not only through trading mechanisms but also through meaningful reductions in energy use.</P>
        <P>Section 5 sets out some of the targets which have secured widespread support among the scientific community. In spring this year European Heads of Government agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 30% by 2020. In addition, European environment ministers have agreed to reduce our emissions by 60% to 80% by 2050, the figures required to achieve <Col N="100"/>an increase of no more than 2&deg; Celsius in global climate change.</P>
        <P>Sections 6 and 7 set out the incremental approach to achieving these reductions. They provide that the Minister and his colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, would be required to report to the House on Ireland&rsquo;s success or otherwise in achieving the annual, gradual targets required of us. It also provides for the development of a three-year plan which would be revised and must be voted upon in the House as the international negotiations proceed. This is a practical approach to the issue of greenhouse gas emissions which must be followed.</P>
        <P>My introductory comments will be followed by Deputy Cuffe who will address some of the solutions Ireland could adopt. Addressing climate change is not a wholly negative undertaking, particularly for Ireland with its mild climate and boundless renewable resources. We have an opportunity to make a positive switch and Deputy Boyle will discuss some of the financial instruments which could help us do so. Deputy Gogarty will address transport issues tomorrow, while Deputy Gormley will discuss what will be the visible consequences of failure to react to the problem of climate change. Our party leader, Deputy Sargent, will round off the debate.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister and all other parties to support the Bill. It matters not whether one is a socialist or capitalist, of the left or right or seated on the Opposition or Government benches. Unless politicians start to be honest and provide real leadership by informing people that we need long-term change based on set targets and incremental changes, we will not succeed in addressing the issue of climate change. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>A journey began seven years ago when Ireland signed the Kyoto Protocol. We knew then that the destination of this journey, in 2012, was to ensure the increase in Ireland&rsquo;s climate change emissions would be limited to 13% over 1990 levels. We knew what we had to do and the protocol was ambitious, far-sighted and reasonable. Five years ago, at the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s climate change abatement strategy, the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated: &ldquo;Business as usual is no longer an option for Ireland&rdquo;. This strategy was the road map which told us what had to be achieved. A promise to renew the strategy every two years has not been kept. Earlier this year, when the Kyoto Protocol came into force, Ireland had an obligation to honour that international commitment that we had made previously. Long journeys start with small steps, but sadly those first few steps have been faltering. We need to concentrate and focus clearly on the target to be met in seven years&rsquo; time.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>Politicians must take a long-term view. We must move away from taxing labour and enterprise towards examining environmental damage and taxing finite resources and poor planning. We must make a shift in how we engage with policies and we must improve Government policies to assist in reducing climate change emissions.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>We are producing more waste, driving further and gobbling up more land with urban sprawl. We need to change policies and get back on track. In Government, the Greens will put policies in place to reduce waste, improve public transport, encourage organic agriculture, promote renewable energy and promote proper planning and construction. It is not rocket science but it requires a commitment from Government to take the environment more seriously than it has done to date.</P>
        <P>If the Climate Change Targets Bill 2005 is approved by the Oireachtas, it would place a legal requirement on the Government to change its policies to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations under international agreements. We want the Minister and his colleagues to report to the House annually on how we are meeting those commitments. So far the news has not been that good.</P>
        <P>There are solutions whereby we can reduce waste. The plastic bag levy worked, for example, and we are delighted when our ideas are taken up by the Government. One cannot stop there, however. We must go further and we look forward to those commitments being met by the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There was an improvement in our climate change emissions when IFI closed, but that was only temporary. We must go further by promoting organic agriculture which accounts for 1% of the sector here compared with 4% in Wales. Such a promotion would improve employment and stop farmers from leaving the land. Things like that can help us. Rather than wringing our hands when the Carlow sugar factory closed, we could examine alternative policies. Why not convert the plant to ethanol and maintain employment in that way? The Government has not given the green light for that idea, however.</P>
        <P>We must also promote renewable energy. We have already seen the first wind turbines on the Arklow bank and planning is there for another <Col N="102"/>100 or so, but we need the incentive from Government to make that happen. Ireland can be part of a European grid that feeds green electricity throughout the European Union. So far, however, we are only in the ha&rsquo;penny place so we need to go further. We need to improve planning policies. Suburban sprawl is the norm at the moment and we are still building huge housing estates miles away from the services people require. We want mixed-use communities that are placed close to schools, churches, shops and jobs. That can be done, but planning standards need to be improved to ensure it happens.</P>
        <P>People are commuting for hours every day in a completely unsustainable manner and the lead in this regard must be taken by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Jobs should be located in commuter towns. I do not want everybody in Navan to have to travel to Dublin every morning. I want the Minister to ensure that jobs are provided in Navan so that the road from Navan to Dublin does not become a parking lot every day from 7.30 a.m.</P>
        <P>The Minister must make the national spatial strategy work rather than engaging in the pork barrel politics of decentralisation. Our plea is for the Minister to make that shift by improving the design of apartments in our towns and cities so that instead of shoe boxes where sound travels, we will build decent homes in which people can rear their children. In the construction sector, for example, zero emission homes are already being built with heat pumps and timber-based, highly insulated construction. The solutions exist; it simply remains for the Minister to take them up.</P>
        <P>In the 21st century, climate change is a greater threat to mankind than terrorism. It requires resolve, courage and conviction from governments. We want to see such resolve from the Minister by supporting this Bill. Climate change is already killing people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is leaving people homeless in New Orleans as a result of the hurricanes it is creating. Ireland should be able to hold its head up high. It could be a good news story but it requires vision from the Minister. We commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Environmental justice rarely goes hand in hand with social and economic justice. In this profligate, wasteful world those who have benefitted from this planet living beyond its environmental means have tended to be &mdash; internationally and within our own society &mdash; those who have what we unfairly define as wealth. Those who have suffered as a result of our wasteful environmental policies are the most disadvantaged. A Bill of this nature would seek to commit both the House and future Governments to abandon such wasteful policies. The effects of the legislation would go beyond that of most legislative measures on the Statute Book, but it is not without precedent. The national pension fund can be referred to as an example in that regard.</P><Col N="103"/>
        <P>The proper instruments must be available to ensure that social and economic justice is achieved as a result of bringing about environmental justice. That unfairness is intensified by choosing not to adopt the required fiscal methods. We rely on taxes that disproportionately affect the poor. According to the Book of Estimates this year, our biggest tax receipts are from value added tax, which cannot be measured at all in terms of environmental input. It is strictly a tax on spending whereby people on the lowest incomes pay the highest proportion of their income in VAT.</P>
        <P>New replacement taxes, rather than additional taxes, must be considered seriously. I am somewhat saddened that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present in the Chamber. I would have been pleased to see his rabid, Pavlovian response to the word &ldquo;tax&rdquo; in any debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I noted with interest the history of the Progressive Democrats Party that was published in recent weeks. Apparently, the first mad idea of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, as a policy position of the then nascent party was to abolish all income tax and replace it with property taxes. I would like to hear the Minister debate such issues as they relate to the type of fiscal instruments we choose to use these days.</P>
        <P>Instruments are available that can help us to achieve our environmental goals. We have proposed a carbon levy, which could reduce VAT and replace the high levels of employers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; PRSI contributions. It would go towards addressing the current fuel poverty problems which continue to deteriorate due to the inactivity of successive Governments in this regard. The problems are exacerbated owing to our reliance on fossil fuels and the fact that the most disadvantaged people must purchase the most expensive fuels for their heating needs, which also cause the most environmental damage. Social welfare fuel allowances need to be doubled at least, so we require a fiscal instrument to allow us to do that.</P>
        <P>As it happens, it may not even be necessary to introduce a carbon levy because there are alternatives. Some countries use individual carbon credits as a mechanism under the Kyoto Agreement and we could use such means to get over our current industrial commitments. The same methods could be used for individual citizens. It might not be easy to administer, but it should form part of the overall debate on determining the best fiscal means to achieve our current target levels under the Kyoto Protocol. Other target levels will follow and, as sure as night follows day, <Col N="104"/>this ongoing process will take up most of the coming century if we are to be serious in tackling these environmental problems.</P>
        <P>We must have the means in place to ensure fuel poverty as an issue disappears from society, the discrepancies between wealth and poverty throughout the world are tackled in a serious way and environmental problems are tackled effectively. This can only be done by restructuring our tax system. We need to get rid of many of our current taxes and replace them with taxes that work and which tax the finite resources and recognise people&rsquo;s needs of food, heat and shelter. The current taxation system does not do that.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister, in what I hope will be a considered reply to what is meant to be a consensual approach by the Green Party to a long-term ongoing problem, will keep in mind the need for a broader debate, put everything on the table and ensure this debate is taken seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Green Party&rsquo;s introduction of this Bill and the opportunity to discuss this crucial issue in the D&aacute;il. I welcome the fact the Bill seeks to enshrine in legislation commitments to reduce emission outputs in the State to prevent an increase in average global temperatures. Little or no opportunity has been afforded to discuss this issue in the D&aacute;il in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response to climate change has been wholly inadequate. Climate change policy should not be about doing as little as possible to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. It must be about showing leadership in global terms and having a commitment to deliver significant decreases in emission outputs. The Kyoto Protocol is merely a minimum requirement and that the State cannot meet its commitments is scandalous. We must start from the point of view of making a genuine commitment to playing a leading role in the fight against climate change. We should set serious targets for the reduction of emissions and demonstrate to the world that, where there is a commitment, such a change can be achieved.</P>
        <P>Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Twenty-six Counties&rsquo; greenhouse gas emissions were restricted to a rise of no more than 13% above their 1990 level. By 2003, greenhouse gas emissions here were already 25% above that level. Clearly, adequate measures have not been implemented to address the growth of emissions. The Government&rsquo;s failure to take the action necessary to curb greenhouse emissions will result, according to &ldquo;preliminary projections&rdquo;, in the State facing an estimated fine of more than &euro;100 million and possibly as much as &euro;180 million. The State&rsquo;s taxpayers and not the big industrial polluters will end up carrying the resulting financial burden.</P>
        <P>Responsible states should not resort solely to emissions trading. It should be remembered that national exchequers will benefit from any actions that result in a reduction in emissions. The targets contained in the Twenty-six Counties&rsquo; national <Col N="105"/>allocation plan on emissions are weak and inadequate, thus eliminating the economic inducement that is necessary in order for emissions trading to be an effective tool in reducing emission outputs.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that, at this stage, there is no prospect of the State meeting its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol? Can the Minister outline exactly how he intends to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s emissions to 13% above 1990 levels? Can he tell the House how the State will pay the fines it will now certainly face? Is it his intention that the State will buy its way out of compliance and not attempt to reduce output of emissions? Does he agree this is irresponsible, as it amounts to the State not playing its part in the global fight to prevent climate change?</P>
        <P>Even a quick examination of Government policy, which has promoted private transport, promoted incineration as a method of waste disposal and emissions trading as a preferred method of complying with the Kyoto Protocol, shows it has little interest in promoting environmental sustainability. Investment in the environment and renewable resources will benefit our citizens today as well as ensure a better quality of life for future generations. The Government must invest in climate change prevention, waste management based on a zero waste policy and environmental protection.</P>
        <P>The issue of climate change challenges many of the tenets of mainstream economics. The past century&rsquo;s economic growth has come at a large cost in terms of the destruction of the environment. Orthodox economic theory is undermined by the reality that all growth is not benign. Climate change and global warming is now a reality that affects the lives of a large proportion of the world&rsquo;s population. All governments have an obligation to implement policies to prevent change.</P>
        <P>Attempts to halt or even slow the process of global warming demands a reappraisal of the supremacy of growth as the ultimate goal. The refusal of the United States of America and a number of other states to accept any measures that would curb growth lies at the root of their refusal to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.</P>
        <P>We need real commitment to an environmentally sustainable future for Ireland, not the piecemeal approach currently adopted. We must investigate the best way to introduce energy taxes but, with this Government, there is always the fear that it will be the weakest and least well-off who will ultimately be penalised, not those creating the greatest amount of emissions. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution to the debate and hope he will be able to update the House regarding the status of the climate change strategy and what actions the Government intends to take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this new Bill. I commend the Green Party for bringing this progressive legislation <Col N="106"/>before the House, which I will strongly support. It seeks to ensure we achieve an annual <i>pro rata</i> in domestic greenhouse emissions necessary internationally to maintain the average increase in global temperatures at less than two degrees. The bottom line is that we need action and targets. Successive Governments have pussyfooted around this issue for years. Now is the time to move and I want all Deputies in the House to unite and support this sensible and progressive legislation.</P>
        <P>I know it is trendy and fashionable at times, in particular in some media and literary political circles, to criticise the Green Party but I take an independent view. If the Green Party has a sensible policy or proposed legislation of quality, I will support it. This has always been my position and hence my support for the Bill. This is also an opportunity to challenge the Government, in particular the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which appears to be sleepwalking through this international crisis. I welcome section 8, which commits the Minister to a national plan to be reviewed every three years.</P>
        <P>I do not use the word &ldquo;sleepwalking&rdquo; lightly. We must face the reality that Ireland is at the bottom of the premier league on the environment, in particular for producing greenhouse gases and waste. Our emission outputs increased by 25% between 1990 and 2003, which is a disgrace. It shows that successive Governments have not delivered on the issue. We have not seen similar climate changes in over 5,000 years. A total of 10% of Swiss glaciers disappeared in the summer of 2003. Europe&rsquo;s average temperature rose by 0.95 degrees in the 20th century.</P>
        <P>We have seen increased flooding in recent years. The people of Drumcondra, Fairview and Clontarf are well aware of this issue due to the effect of flooding in their local communities. Internationally, there were 238 floods between 1975 and 2001, yet there were 15 floods in 2002. Let us not forget the 20,000 people who died in Europe in the heat wave of summer 2003. This is the reality of our debate and a warning for the future. Between one third and a half of the world&rsquo;s forests have been burned or chopped down, which is why we need urgent action. Tonight is a glorious opportunity to do something before it is too late.</P>
        <P>Before I go into further detail on the legislation, it is also important to highlight the position regarding wars and their terrible human and environmental costs. Exploding large bombs in the Middle East, including Iraq, and elsewhere and using chemical weapons not only destroys human beings but destroys the environment. I raise this issue in the context of this debate as not only are Mr. Blair and President Bush war criminals, they are also guilty of profound international environmental vandalism. They must be challenged at all levels and in all quarters. We cannot turn a blind eye to President Bush and his <Col N="107"/>allies as this can never be an option in democratic politics.</P>
        <P>I challenge the Government on these issues. Our citizens are becoming sick and tired at the destruction of our world, our people and our environment. I welcome section 5 as it sets out targets for the Government at international level. It ascribes a leading role to the Government in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in concert with other EU and OECD member states. Section 5(2) identifies two targets for the reduction of domestic greenhouse gas emissions necessary to maintain the average increase in global temperatures below 2&deg; Celsius, namely, a reduction of 15% to 30% by 2020 and a reduction of 60% to 80% by 2050. These are commonsense and progressive proposals. If we want results, we must have targets. I stress the need for planning, implementation and action.</P>
        <P>I also warmly welcome section 6 which sets down the terms of the preparation and the content of the national plan to ensure our obligation to meet climate change targets are fulfilled. It commits the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to drawing up a national plan detailing the measures required to achieve the target reduction in our domestic emissions. The plan will subsequently be reviewed and modified as required. Section 6(2) provides that a scheme of <i>per capita</i> carbon allocation and training scheme may be included in the national plan. This is a detailed plan for the Minister to implement as he needs to do something rather than just waffling on programmes such as &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;. We have had enough talk and old guff. Now is the time for the Minister to get on the pitch and score a goal for the environment.</P>
        <P>I challenge the Government and the other political parties but I acknowledge we also have a role to play, both as parliamentarians and as citizens. We must play our part in local communities. I wish to pay tribute to the local residents and community and environmental groups in my area, especially in Clontarf, Marino, Fairview, Killester, Artane, Beaumont, Coolock, Raheny and Drumcondra. I commend the groups such as Charlemont residents&rsquo; association and Dublin Bay Watch for their great community and voluntary work and their efforts to improve our environment. It all starts locally and it is important we recognise and value these people working in their own areas. They have all made a positive contribution in making the environment a safer place for children and themselves. I thank them and commend them on their magnificent efforts.</P>
        <P>Section 7 sets out the role of the various Ministers in ensuring that Ireland fulfils its obligations in reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Section 7(3) commits the Minister for Finance to report annually to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the provisions made in the annual budget and to ensure our annual target reduction in domestic <Col N="108"/>emissions is met. I hope the Minister for Finance can deliver on subsection (3) as it will need finance to work well and efficiently.</P>
        <P>I refer to flooding and two important issues in my own local area, in particular the proposed infill of the 52 acres in Dublin Bay. This is a very dangerous proposal. I urge the Minister not to allow this to happen. There have been major flooding issues in the Clontarf and Fairview area. This is a nightmare which will be worse if action is not taken. Dublin Bay experienced extensive flooding last year. The Environmental Protection Agency recommended that no further reclamation of estuary lands be undertaken before the reality of rising sea levels is addressed. I urge the Minister to listen carefully to those recommendations. I will work as long as I am a Member of this House to protect and preserve what remains of the amenities of Dublin Bay.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of the flooding of the Tolka river which is directly linked to the issue of climate change. Waste water from the Dublin Port tunnel is being pumped into the Tolka river, despite major efforts to improve the environment.</P>
        <P>Section 8 deals with reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas and accountability. I welcome the legislation. I thank Deputies Eamon Ryan, Cuffe, Gormley, Gogarty, Boyle and their leader, Deputy Sargent, and commend them on their vision, leadership and courage in bringing forward this progressive legislation which I will support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House in response to this Private Member&rsquo;s Bill. I thank Deputies Eamon Ryan and Cuffe who came to see me and we spoke at some length about this Bill.</P>
        <P>All of us in this House are agreed that climate change is taking place and some of the evidence has been outlined. The most visible indications of this trend include the retreat of the ice sheets on the world&rsquo;s mountain glaciers and at the polar regions. Its impact will be far-reaching and will affect developed as well as developing countries. Various extreme weather events over recent years have emphasised how exposed we are to economic and social dislocation from environmental factors. While it is not possible to link individual events directly to climate change, some extreme events are consistent with what scientists have been saying about climate change for a number of years.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, climate change will impact on agriculture, energy, construction, transport, communications, tourism, fisheries and forestry, all highly sensitive to weather and climate factors. Research by Met &Eacute;ireann among others, has shown that flooding and storm damage is expected to become more prevalent in coming years and increasing financial costs and further losses due to property damage may be anticipated as the climate warms.</P><Col N="109"/>
        <P>The European Union is of the view that global temperature increases should be limited to 2&deg;C and has articulated a position on what needs to be done to stabilise global temperatures at this level. I will return to this point. It is sufficient to say at this point, however, that global average temperatures have already increased by 0.7&deg;C over the last 100 years and are projected to grow further by between 1.4&deg;C and 5.8&deg;C over the next century, depending on which projection one reads.</P>
        <P>This Bill aims at committing Ireland in law to quantified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions above and beyond existing commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and it is unique, internationally, in that regard. The Bill also seeks to commit this country to establishing targets for the percentage of our total primary energy requirement to be provided by renewable energy supply. Relevant Ministers would be required to report annually to the Oireachtas on progress towards achieving these targets.</P>
        <P>The Government agrees with the sentiment inherent in this Bill that Ireland should fulfil its climate change obligations. I would go further and say it would make sense for us to fulfil our climate change obligations. However, it does not agree that it should establish a commitment in legislation, which can be challenged in the courts, to achieving longer-term reduction targets on which there is as yet no international agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not achieve anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I would argue that the Government cannot subscribe to a Bill which seeks to set long-term reduction targets on a legislative basis. These targets are properly the area of Government policy. Climate change policy has been adopted on foot of decisions taken by the Government and is based on international commitments that Ireland has signed up to and ratified, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol to that convention.</P>
        <P>It is not necessary for the Government to enshrine in legislation its commitment to a fair and equitable reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This commitment is already demonstrated by Ireland&rsquo;s signature and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol which represents a real and significant contribution to combating global climate change. Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol target is to limit emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. This target is the product of negotiations at international and subsequent EU levels. The Kyoto Protocol set emissions reduction targets for developed countries of 5% on 1990 values by 2012 and within this overall target, the then EU 15 were given a reduction target of 8% relative <Col N="110"/>to 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s target is the product of a burden-sharing agreement between the EU 15. This burden sharing identified Ireland&rsquo;s economic development at the time of the discussions.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy approach to meeting the State&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol target is set out in the national climate change strategy. This is the appropriate place for discussion of national and sectoral targets. The Government is not against setting targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Meaningless targets.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Returning to the Government&rsquo;s grounds for opposing this Bill and quite separate from the Government&rsquo;s opposition in principle to enshrining targets in legislation, it is entirely inappropriate for legislation made by the Oireachtas to contain reduction targets on which there is as yet no international consensus.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would ask the Deputies to allow the Minister speak without interruption. The Deputies were allowed make their contributions without interruption and if they were not able to put everything into their contributions, the Chair cannot facilitate them now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I was put off by the Minister&rsquo;s interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognised Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s positive contributions on two occasions. I believe in praise where praise is due but also believe in the truth in this. Sadly, while the Deputy&rsquo;s sentiment is correct, this Bill would make no sense. It would do us irreparable damage and there is no logic to what the Deputy is proposing.</P>
        <P>The overall greenhouse gas reduction targets to which the Bill refers are not based on internationally agreed reduction commitments. They are, in fact, the goals adopted by the European Council earlier this year with a view towards the commencement of negotiations on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol. They are goals, not agreements.</P>
        <P>In this context, I want to be clear that the Government takes seriously its existing climate change commitments. We will take on our fair share of whatever commitments are agreed as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto is the only existing internationally binding agreement that controls emissions of greenhouse gases. There is no logic in anticipating other agreements which have not yet been reached.</P>
        <P>The debate is in a sense opportune, given that the 11th conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is taking place in Montreal. I will attend the ministerial segment of the meeting which takes place next week. The meeting will incorporate for the first time the parties to the Kyoto Protocol since ratification by Russia and the taking effect of the protocol, and will provide the occasion for the formal adoption of the 2001 Marrakesh Accords for fulfilling parties&rsquo; Kyoto Protocol commitments. Those accords set out the detailed methodologies by which the Kyoto Protocol is implemented and the parties&rsquo; commitments are tracked, and they do not include the proposition the Deputies are making here.</P>
        <P>As I have mentioned, the Montreal meeting will also present the first formal opportunity for parties to discuss the future of the international climate change process after the Kyoto Protocol&rsquo;s first commitment period expires in 2012. The European Union will seek to engage parties on the key issues of how to build on the Kyoto Protocol. This will be done with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of stabilising concen<Col N="112"/>trations of atmospheric greenhouse gases at a safe level.</P>
        <P>What such a safe level should be has been quantified and articulated by the European Council of Ministers at the Environment Council meeting in March and subsequently at the Spring European Council. The EU made considerable progress in defining its position on a medium and long-term strategy to counter climate change. In summary, it was agreed that to fulfil the EU objective of limiting global annual mean temperature increases to a maximum of 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration levels will need to be stabilised &ldquo;well below 550 parts per million volume CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> equivalent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>To achieve these stabilisation levels, global emissions of greenhouse gases will need to peak within two decades, followed by a substantial reduction of at least 15% and possibly by as much as 50% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. The EU is willing to consider emissions reduction targets for industrialised countries of 15% to 30% by 2020 and 60% to 80% by 2050. These proposed targets are intended as the basis for international discussions on further action. In the context of this debate, I must stress that they are in no way binding on the EU at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government already agreed them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They are targets; that is why they were agreed. While the European Council agreed proposed targets for the post-2012 period, the Council also recognised the importance of engaging other major emitters outside the EU in the negotiation process and that this would require a degree of flexibility on the solutions proposed.</P>
        <P>If negotiations on targets proceed in a similar fashion to those on Kyoto, the EU targets will be apportioned between member states as part of a burden sharing agreement. The Kyoto burden sharing agreement took into account a number of factors, including the state of the economy during the base period, projected economic growth and available projections for future greenhouse gas emissions. The targets for each member state therefore reflect their particular national circumstances and Ireland&rsquo;s specific target will then have to emerge from a process of negotiation within whatever overall target is set by the EU. It is simply not possible at this stage to anticipate what that will be.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Eamon Ryan is being tiresome. His interruptions are not even sensible. The reality is we are talking about a moving target and he is talking about binding us to something which has not been agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about telling the people what is possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support the Deputy&rsquo;s sentiment but his sense seems to have lost him.</P>
        <P>The European Union has a strong position on climate change and on what it wants from Montreal. It is seeking a broad, open and early discussion. It hopes particularly to engage with the US, if possible, and the heavier greenhouse gas emitting developing countries such as China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. Negotiations at Montreal are unlikely to be easy. The debate is ongoing on this issue.</P>
        <P>I now want to return briefly to consider the basis for the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting its Kyoto Protocol target. The national climate change strategy provides the basis for Government policy and action to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the most efficient and equitable manner. The strategy also ensures that Ireland meets its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The strategy identifies a range of policies and measures to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>Progress has already been achieved in progressing measures across a variety of sectors. Among the measures implemented are increasing the share of renewable energy in line with meeting our EU targets; fuel switching to less polluting fuels in power generation; emissions labelling in motor vehicles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Particularly useless.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Compared with what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>At the time the strategy was being developed, it was projected that, in the absence of any measures to address the problem, Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in the Kyoto commitment period would be 37% above 1990 levels. The actual figures for recent years show that we were 31% above 1990 levels in 2001; 29% above in 2002 and 25% above in 2003, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing the Government did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;produced precisely the positive effect of which the Deputies speak. While these reductions are positive, we cannot rest on our laurels. Rapid growth in the economy is placing an upward pressure on our greenhouse gas emissions and requires us to intensify efforts to bring about the required reductions. The latest available projections of emissions for the 2008 to 2012 period suggest that, even with existing implemented measures, Ireland will face a shortfall of some 8 million tonnes per annum in reaching our Kyoto target. Incidentally, the original projection was 9.2 million tonnes.</P>
        <P>To this end, work is under way in my Department on a review of the strategy, taking account of developments at national, European and international levels. This review is important, not only to take account of major changes in the climate change policy landscape at both international and domestic levels but also to seek to identify what additional cost-effective measures Ireland might be able to implement. I am keen to investigate further the potential of areas such as afforestation, energy efficiency, biofuels and anaerobic digestion of agricultural manures. In areas such as these Ireland has a natural advantage which we should attempt to exploit.</P>
        <P>Other areas are being examined at EU level in the context of the European Climate Change Programme, including the development of energy-efficient technologies, carbon capture and storage as well as a variety of other devices. I will shortly publish a review document, which will assess progress in implementing the strategy, including emissions trends across each of its sectors. The review will outline proposals for additional measures for Ireland to cost effectively meet its target under the Kyoto Protocol. It is my intention that this document will inform debate on how best to achieve further emissions and, in turn, the development of a revised climate change strategy.</P>

Certainly, by the time I publish a revised climate change strategy, the way forward may be clarified, though this process is likely to take considerable time. Existing measures in the strategy, together with any additional measures that might be put in place, form only part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting its target under the Kyoto Protocol. The 8 million tonne gap I mentioned will also be addressed through a combination of emissions reductions, by installations, participating in the EU emissions trading scheme and through the purchase by Government of carbon credits sufficient to address any shortfall. The latter is a device identified as a sustainable way forward in the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>As regards the former, the EU emissions trading scheme is a regime whereby major emitters of greenhouse gases are made responsible by their national governments for delivering a stated proportion of the national target for reductions. Deputy Morgan touched on this, showing how imperfect is his understanding of the whole process. In Ireland, these emitters include the power generation sector and energy intensive industries such as cement and alumina production and they account for one third of total emissions of carbon dioxide.</P>
        <P>Turning back to Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s contribution, the economic rationale behind emissions trading is to use market mechanisms to ensure that emissions reductions are achieved in the least costly manner. The scheme thus provides a strong financial incentive for firms to reduce their emissions by investing in more efficient technology or changing their processes. By any standards, the establishment of emissions trading should be considered to be a success and demonstrates that market mechanisms have a place alongside traditional command and control measures in environmental policies.</P>
        <P>I recently signed SI 706 of 2005, which changes the emissions trading regulations to allow credits from the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms &mdash; the joint implementation and clean development mechanisms &mdash; to be traded within the EU emissions trading scheme. This will expand the scope of emission reductions available for participants in the scheme, thereby lowering overall cost of compliance. The facility will give an important boost to activity under the Kyoto Protocol&rsquo;s flexible mechanisms, opening up investment oppor<Col N="116"/>tunities to the developing world, which I am sure all Deputies in the House will welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU emissions trading scheme is initially operating on a pilot basis for the period from 2005 to 2007, which is designed to provide the Government and participating firms an opportunity to learn and to refine approaches for the next phase, which covers the period 2008 to 2012. I will bring proposals to Government in the new year on the overall allocation of allowances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I now turn to the final element in the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to meeting its Kyoto Protocol target, the purchase of carbon credits by the State. There has been some disingenuous commentary about the potential costs to the Exchequer so I will make the position clear. The Government has signalled that it would, on the basis of greenhouse gas emission projections available at that time, purchase up to 3.7 million carbon allowances per year in the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008 to 2012. On the basis of an assessed average price of &euro;15 per carbon allowance during that period, the total annual cost to the Exchequer would be &euro;55.5 million. This was mentioned in answers to parliamentary questions earlier today. The ultimate cost to the Exchequer will depend on the final purchasing requirement and the price of carbon when the credits are purchased. I am developing a strategy for the purchase of allowances in consultation with my colleagues in Government.</P>
        <P>Returning to the provisions of the Bill, I have outlined my opposition to it on the basis that it is inappropriate to establish targets in legislation. It is further inappropriate to propose targets which have not yet been adopted by international agreement. The Bill contains a provision for the establishment of targets for the percentage of Ireland&rsquo;s total primary energy requirement to be provided from renewable energy and would require the Government to report to the Oireachtas on this and on the expected reductions in energy use that will be achieved through increased energy efficiency.</P>
        <P>Climate change policy is closely linked to energy policy, but also to policies as regards industrialisation, transport, agriculture and across the range. The inter-relationship with energy policy is particularly important and in this regard policies on renewable energy have an important contribution to make in terms of the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe mentioned renewable energy. The Government is committed to the generation of 13.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2010. Indeed, the growth in Ireland&rsquo;s total energy requirement in line with the expansion of the economy hides the fact that overall, Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy supply grew by 71% between 1990 and 2002. He is right in saying that more could be done, I absolutely agree with him. Renewable energy will be a significant contribution to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="117"/>greenhouse gas emissions. I agree with the central point he is making to the effect that we have to change our attitude to that. We cannot adopt a NIMBY attitude, for example, in respect of wind turbines, which has happened in many cases.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s recent decision to change from a competitive tendering to a fixed price support mechanism to ensure adequate support for future renewable energy projects demonstrates our commitment to reaching the 13.2% target. On current figures, Ireland is approximately half way towards that target.</P>
        <P>As regards reductions in energy use, I fully agree that energy efficiency is one of the key areas in which Ireland, as with other countries, can make progress. With high oil prices, we urgently need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels through increased use of renewable energy. The other side of this coin is our demand for energy and we can address this by becoming more energy efficient. The European Commission recently identified potential savings of 20% in Europe&rsquo;s energy consumption by 2020. This is confirmed by today&rsquo;s report from the European Environment Agency on the state of the European environment, which highlights energy efficiency and renewables as two of the key measures to reducing Europe&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

	<P>In summary, the Government is actively committed to reaching its existing international targets and is committed to working proactively with our European and international partners to developing a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol. The Government will reach its Kyoto Protocol target through a combination of measures, including the emissions trading, measures set out in the national climate change strategy and additional steps to be agreed in the context of a revised strategy; and the purchase by the Government of sufficient allowances to meet any shortfall.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the general thrust of this Bill as it indicates an anxiety to address an issue that needs to be tackled. The Minister himself has indicated that. It also serves to focus on the issues to which the Bill refers because failure to focus on a subject is failure to do anything about it. It is appropriate that the Green Party introduce the Bill at this time, given that the issues involved have affected us in the last ten to 15 years, but will affect us to a far greater extent in the next 20 to 25 years.</P>
        <P>I agree that there should be a long-term plan for energy use and conservation. There should also be a medium-term plan and I fully agree that there should be a short-term plan. These plans should be interlinked, interdependent and updated on a regular basis. Otherwise, we will not be able to identify our energy uses and emissions, how they are changing and the degree to which we must comply under the Kyoto Protocol. We need to focus on the limits that must be met and the Bill has much to offer in going about that task. The Minister has been very critical of the Bill, but it is a genuine attempt by a party to address the issues. We are all in the same business at the same time. My party identified the same issues a few weeks ago, with a different emphasis in different areas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The object of the exercise is to achieve the following outcomes. We must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and on imported fuels. We must introduce a greater degree of reliance on renewable energy and ensure that all we do reduces emissions into the atmosphere. This does not require rocket science and everybody can play some part. The Minister mentioned the question of engine emission labelling. Engine efficiency labelling is <Col N="119"/>equally important. There is a great difference between a motor vehicle that yields 20 to 25 miles to the gallon &mdash; we have plenty of them in the country &mdash; and a motor vehicle that delivers 60 miles to the gallon. The two vehicles are capable of doing a similar job. There is a huge difference in the emissions and in the import costs of both vehicles. I am not suggesting there should be a carbon tax because I am loath to offer the Government other ways of raising taxes, especially on an over-burdened society that has been hammered by the Government with all kinds of taxes in the last seven or eight years. However, the same result can be achieved by efficiency labelling to which the Green Party Deputies referred, as did the Minister by his own admission. These actions require the co-operation of a number of Departments, including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Agriculture and Food. The thrust of Fine Gael policy in this area was to focus attention on what each of these Departments could do to bring about a position whereby we were less dependent on energy imports, had greater energy efficiency and delivered a reduction in emissions.</P>
        <P>Conservation and insulation are capable of making the single biggest contribution to reduction in emissions in that area. It is very simple, requires little effort and is beneficial to the community and the economy. It does not improve the revenue prospects for the Government, but who worries about that? It has the ability to reduce the dependency on imported oil by up to 23%. Other speakers referred to growing crops for alternative energy sources such as biofuels. It is an area that has considerable scope. It does not necessarily follow that we would make a fortune from it, but it could reduce emissions.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>Wind energy has the greatest potential of all in replacing existing energies based on fossil fuels simply by generating more wind energy. The Minister referred to the difficulties we have had recently with environmental rules. There is also a difficulty in getting access to the grid. There are currently several groups producing alternative energy through wind generated electricity that have been held up in their attempts to get access to the grid. Many of these groups have despaired of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The explanatory memorandum of the Bill states that it seeks to introduce legislation to ensure we achieve the annual <i>pro-rata</i> reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions that are necessary internationally for the average increase in global temperatures to be maintained at less than two degrees. That is a reasonable aspiration and I was surprised to hear that the Minister expressed his grave disappointment at the contributions from this side of the House. Everyone on this side of the House is dis<Col N="120"/>appointed with the Minister&rsquo;s response to the Bill. However, we are not surprised because that is the normal thing that happens here. Blessed are those who do not seek justice, for they shall not be disappointed.</P>
        <P>We are all agreed that climate change is happening, yet the Minister stated in his speech:</P>
        <P LI="1">This Bill aims at committing Ireland in law to quantified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions above and beyond existing commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The Bill also seeks to commit this country to establishing targets for the percentage of our total primary energy requirement to be provided by renewable energy supply. Relevant Ministers would be required to report annually to the Oireachtas on progress towards achieving these targets.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is very reasonable that we should try to achieve that, but later he went on to state that the Government has decided to oppose the Bill on the basis it is inappropriate to propose targets which have not yet been adopted by international agreement. What is wrong with putting down targets? Why not let Ireland lead the way in putting down targets for the rest of Europe to follow? I cannot see how the Government claims that it must oppose the Bill because it sets targets we have not yet been asked to set.</P>
        <P>I thank the Green Party for bringing forward this Bill and we will support it at this stage. The Green Party has been to the forefront in promoting this and other environmental issues in the House. When faced with a Government that has such scant regard for the environment, it is a good job that a party highlights these issues. Fine Gael has made an issue of global warming and it will be one of our priorities in the next general election. Alternative energy is not just an environmental distraction, but is also an economic imperative. At our recent conference in Millstreet, we unveiled a series of policies that we believe will make an impact in the country&rsquo;s attempt to meet its international environmental commitments. In responding to the debate tomorrow, perhaps the Minister might commit to one or two of those policies. We would help farmers to enter the bio-crop market by providing established grants for producer groups that would contribute up to 50% of the cost of setting such groups, subject to a maximum of &euro;300,000 per group.</P>
        <P>We would boost production of biofuels through a public competition for the establishment and operation of a number of biofuel processing plants strategically located in a selected number of locations. We would create a market for biofuels by legislating for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources. All petrol sold at filling stations would include a 5% biofuel mix and all diesel fuel would contain a 2% biodiesel mix. We would reduce emissions from vehicles by establishing a system of energy efficiency labelling for vehicles. Those vehicles <Col N="121"/>awarded a higher rating would be rewarded with a reduced rate of VRT.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Similarly, as Deputy Durkan has stated, vehicles with a lower rate of efficiency would be penalised with a higher rate of VRT. We would amend the national spatial strategy to include major renewable energy infrastructure projects and would include such projects in regional development plans.</P>
        <P>We would propose the provision of a new community dividend to act as compensation for those communities located close to important infrastructure that aids the entire country to reach its alternative energy commitments. We would move towards generating 33% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity needs from renewable sources. Deputy Durkan has already outlined the value of wind-produced energy.</P>
        <P>We would mix direct State investment with a regulatory regime which would give national grid access to renewable sources above all others. We would prioritise the creation of a network of wind turbines to harness the potential of wind energy which in this country is estimated to be the best in the European Union. We would consider a complete separation of the ESB from the national grid to ensure a level playing field for all energy suppliers. We would increase funding for research and development in the offshore hydroelectric sector to ensure that established targets are met.</P>
        <P>We would increase the funding available to Energy Action and all those similarly engaged in the specifically focused target of bringing existing housing stock up to the insulation standards of newly built homes. In that regard, much energy could be saved by the installation of proper insulation and standards in homes, particularly in those older homes built 20, 30 or more years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>We would extend grant aid to householders for those who wished to convert existing home heating technology to renewable energy technology, up to a value of &euro;500. We would establish a centre of excellence for alternative energy, charged with ensuring that Ireland develops a world class alternative energy sector.</P>
        <P>These are our proposals. I want the Minister, or whoever will be replying on the Government&rsquo;s behalf later in the debate, to respond to our points and to examine whether they are feasible. Opposition Members would be delighted if the Government took up our proposals and policies as it has done in many other respects. It would be for the general good if it did so. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution later.</P>

        <P>I am disappointed by the negative response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It was in line with the replies he gave earlier today during exchanges at Question Time. He seeks to talk his way out of and around the Government&rsquo;s failure to deliver on our Kyoto Protocol targets. We are an embarrassment and are ashamed of the Minister.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Collectively, the rest of the European Union is going in the right direction. The 15 pre-accession EU states are 5% under the 1990 target, while the 25 member states are 7% under the 1990 target. Ireland, under this Government, is 25% above the 1990 target. Currently, under this Administration, there does not appear to be any hope that we will reach the target. All the Government intends to do is play for time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This was not a reference to what might be agreed at the Montreal meeting. The Minister referred to the clarification that will take place on a wet Friday, sometime between now and the middle of 2007, in every primary school in the country. While we heard claptrap from the Minister about the urgency of the issue of climate change and how concerned he is about the dangers, effectively the Government is putting off the evil day until the general election is safely around the corner. If it is returned to office, it will have something to say about climate change. If not, the Government parties will be on the Opposition benches and will blame the unfortunate Members on the Government benches who will be obliged to sort out the mess left behind.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is doing to the environment what it did to the economy in 1977, when it made a mess of it, blamed other people and attempted to re-write history.</P>

	<P>This is the most progressive economy in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The national climate change strategy was published just over five years ago. At the beginning of the plain guide version, we are told that we face a grim future unless we change. The plain guide goes on to tell us that the national climate change strategy turns the Kyoto Agreement into a programme for action. I should mention that the national climate change strategy was published in 2000, three years after the Kyoto Agreement was signed.</P>
        <P>In the five years since that programme for action was devised, what progress has been made? Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions are 25% up on the benchmark 1990 value. While our limit is an increase of 13% by 2012, we have doubled this in only five years.</P>
        <P>With only six years to go before the Kyoto deadline of 2012, it appears unlikely that Ireland will reduce carbon emissions to our allowed limit. This means that Ireland will have to buy carbon &mdash; the Minister informed the House today that 8 million tonnes are required &mdash; or the right to pollute on the international market. In other words, the Government plans to buy its way with taxpayers&rsquo; money out of its inaction on the environment.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, admitted today that a further reduction of 8 million tonnes of carbon emissions will be required by 2012, he declined to state by how much carbon will be reduced each year. However under Article 3(4) of the Kyoto Protocol, this information should have been submitted prior to the Montreal meeting. Article 3(2) states: &ldquo;each Party included in Annex I shall, by 2005, have made demonstrable progress in achieving its commitments under this Protocol&rdquo;. Article 3(4) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Prior to the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol [in plain language, that means the Montreal meeting] each Party included in Annex I shall provide, for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, data to establish its level of carbon stocks in 1990 and to enable an estimate to be made of its changes in carbon stocks in subsequent years.</P><Col N="124"/>
        <P FLI="0">Hence, it is plain that we are required to submit a year by year reduction in our level of carbon admissions to the Montreal meeting. The Minister told us today that he is not obliged to do so.</P>
        <P>He also declined to state what the worst case scenario would be if Ireland does not meet its targets. Surely at this late stage, when it is quite clear that the national climate change strategy is far behind in its implementation, the Minister should seek this type of information from his advisers. The cost has been estimated by the Government&rsquo;s consultants as being between &euro;102 million and &euro;120 million each year for the next five years in fines for our excess carbon dioxide emissions. That is a total of &euro;600 million over five years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s time is up. Since 1980, 64% of catastrophic events have been attributable to weather and climate extremes. The European Environment Agency report singles Ireland out for comment on carbon emissions, stating that we face a major challenge if we are to meet our Kyoto Protocol limit of 13% above our 1990 level. This holds true in the week that the parties to the protocol meet in Montreal, where we are obliged under Article 3 of the protocol to show demonstrable progress towards meeting our commitments. All we can now show is demonstrable progress on ignoring our commitments.</P>
        <P>For all these reasons, this Bill is timely. If the Government had done what it said it would do, or even half of what it said it would do, perhaps we would not need such a Bill, but it is clear that imposing a legal obligation on the Government to adhere to its commitments is necessary. The Bill sets down a number of important responsibilities for the Minsters for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, including the publication of annual reports outlining the success of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to achieve carbon emission reductions and renewable energy supply targets. Where the required reductions or targets have not been met the Minister in question will be required to report this to the House with the intended solutions to ensure the targets are subsequently met.</P>
        <P>The Bill is forward-looking and plans for emission targets up to 2050, which many experts agree is the critical date by which temperature stabilisation must be achieved. If the many specific targets and measures that were detailed in the national climate change strategy had been given any priority, perhaps we would not have needed to introduce this Bill in the House. However, since the approach to the implementation of the strategy has been largely half-hearted, the Bill is not just a good idea but is necessary.</P><Col N="126"/>
        <P>The key initiatives planned in the national climate change strategy include carbon energy taxation, use of emissions trading, measures supportive of ending coal-firing at Moneypoint, fuel switching to low and zero carbon fuels, livestock reductions and lower fertiliser use, fuel efficiency, demand management and modal shift in transport, energy efficiency in construction, and adjustment of the new house grant. Little or no progress has been made in respect of any of these.</P>
        <P>We are constantly being told by the Minister and the Minister of State that considerable numbers of residential buildings are being built in this country. Since the Kyoto Protocol was agreed, approximately one quarter of the country&rsquo;s entire housing stock has been built and thus we have completely missed an opportunity.</P>

It wants three more years, in which it will build more dwellings with nine-inch cavity blocks to a standard that will cause expense and grief to those who buy them. It has missed a great opportunity.</P>

	<P>It is wrong to look at the Kyoto Protocol targets and the issue of the climate change strategy in a negative way. They would provide a great opportunity for this country if we had a Government with the imagination and will to act upon them. I refer to the opportunity and challenge to become self-sufficient in energy production, to change our agricultural focus from the production of food to the production of raw material for energy, to move to the top in terms of energy conservation and to have an environment of which all of us can be proud rather than the litany of embarrassments to which we are subjected week in, week out on the publication of every new report by the European Commission or some European agency.

      <sTitle>Ambulance Service.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of the provision of an emergency ambulance service for the town of Carrick-on-Suir and surrounding areas. The current ambulance service, while excellent, is simply unable to meet the recognised response times to deal with cardiac arrests, heart attacks and road traffic accidents. I have raised this issue consistently and as recently as 14 April this year.</P>
        <P>Carrick-on-Suir and its hinterland have a population of approximately 10,000. There are excellent health facilities in the town. The local hospital is St. Brigid&rsquo;s and the local health centre is located on its grounds. The town has the usual general practitioner service. I compliment the local voluntary organisations, particularly on their promotion of the concept of first responders and the use of defibrillators. The people of Carrick-on-Suir are now involved in this and they <Col N="129"/>are to be congratulated on it. However, an emergency ambulance facility is still required for Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P>The lack of emergency ambulance cover based in the town puts lives at risk. At present, Carrick-on-Suir and its hinterland are covered by ambulance stations at Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir but that is not good enough to provide the service required. Response times for cardiac arrest and road traffic accident patients are simply not good enough to give the people involved in such incidents a chance to survive. The response times are approximately 25 minutes.</P>
        <P>Initial response times are approximately three minutes. There is a minute and a half for the response of the ambulance control staff in taking the emergency call, logging the details and calling the local ambulance to respond. The ambulance crew will respond within another minute and a half. Within three minutes, therefore, the ambulance crew is on its way to the incident. However, after that the response times are simply inadequate and leave much to be desired.</P>
        <P>To give proper attention to cardiac arrest the latest response time is eight minutes. It is similar in the case of road traffic accidents. It is not possible to meet those response times in Carrick-on-Suir and its hinterland as it will take a minimum of 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive from Clonmel or Waterford. That is not good enough. Ambulance staff are well trained. They are emergency medical technicians and have paramedic status. There is no point having ambulance staff trained to such an extent but unable to get to the scene of an accident or cardiac arrest in time.</P>
        <P>I have raised this issue on a number of occasions and I will continue to raise it. I urge the Minister to respond positively. The ambulance staff and ambulances are available and the country is awash with money. There is enough money to locate an ambulance and ambulance staff in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Deputy Healy for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of ambulance services. As part of the reform of the health service, a national ambulance office, NAO, has recently been established under the auspices of the national hospitals office within the HSE. The office has responsibility for the provision of pre-hospital emergency care nationally and is working closely with the pre-hospital emergency care council, as the body responsible for the development of standards in pre-hospital emergency care.</P>
        <P>The council is conducting a pilot spatial analysis study of emergency services demand and deployment options. The study is examining how <Col N="130"/>pre-hospital services are delivered and highlighting possible gaps in the delivery of services. The information obtained from this analysis, which is being piloted initially in the HSE north-western area, will inform decisions on the future deployment of advanced paramedic services, standard EMT services and first responder schemes in other regions, including the HSE south-eastern area.</P>
        <P>Ambulance services to persons resident in Carrick-on-Suir are provided from ambulance bases at Clonmel and Ardkeen. The HSE national ambulance office has advised that the information obtained from the spatial analysis study will assist in its review of how ambulance services are to be provided for the people of south Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir. The HSE south-eastern area is also reviewing the implications for the ambulance services in the county arising from the planned amalgamation of South Tipperary General Hospital with Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Cashel.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of developments in the HSE south-eastern area ambulance service in recent years. Additional funding was provided to facilitate the continued phasing out of on-call in the region. The HSE south-eastern area has advised that the elimination of on-call has been completed in south Tipperary which will facilitate further improvement in response times. Additional minor capital funding was allocated to the HSE south-eastern region to assist it with its fleet and equipment replacement programme which are essential prerequisites for enhanced speedy and appropriate care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter to find out what information technology supports have been or are intended to be given to a company in my constituency, Forward Emphasis Limited. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is present. He is aware of the serious decline north-east Donegal, especially Inishowen, has suffered with the decline of the textile industry. The Minister has been active in trying to find solutions to this problem.</P>
        <P>I was attending the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body when I received an e-mail about this matter. The body was discussing developing jobs and infrastructural links between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland, with particular emphasis on my constituency. The e-mail notified me that my constituency was possibly going to lose another company. Immediately I asked to raise the matter in the House and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to do so.</P>
        <P>In north Inishowen a company operating as a call centre and occupying a former Fruit of the Loom factory is in urgent need of fixed line broadband technology, such as ADSL, to satisfy its clients&rsquo; expectations and requirements. Private <Col N="131"/>telecommunications operators are able to satisfy the needs of companies in Inishowen by providing sophisticated services. I was therefore surprised to learn that Forward Emphasis, a company that has given indications of doing well financially in its venture with a substantial turnover, has this week publicly stated that it has not been able to secure the appropriate technology it requires to operate effectively. The company has not been given support by local government and employment bodies in order to do so. This leaves a question mark over its ability to continue in Malin Head.</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that Eircom, which formerly held a monopoly on technology such as ADSL, were some months back in a position to satisfy the company&rsquo;s needs. There would clearly be a cost for such sophisticated technology, which I believe was in the region of &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000, although I am open to correction. The lead-in time was approximately two months. I am aware from my time on Donegal County Council and since that the council has given significant support to Forward Emphasis, not only in selling them premises at a keen rate, which the council purchased following the closure of Fruit of the Loom, but in offering grant assistance for a three-month period to assist the broadband proposal.</P>
        <P>Other providers are entering the market and delivering fixed line broadband services into centres with minimum requirements regarding population density. However, this is taking some time, particularly in rural areas. Not everybody in towns with the population requirement can be connected. To be connected, a customer must be located within 3 km as the cable runs from the enabled telephone exchange. Often people situated immediately beside the exchange cannot avail of the technology because of the way the cable was initially laid in the ground by Eircom.</P>
        <P>
          <i>The Inish Times</i>, a company which is growing rapidly in Buncrana and has a circulation of between 5,000 and 6,000 copies, is highly dependent on technology. It had to install wireless broadband as it is currently connected to the old exchange, and fixed line broadband is connected to the new exchange. It has missed out despite the fixed line running approximately 500 yds from its building.</P>
        <P>There is considerable cost in installing the equipment to a telephone exchange in order to enable ADSL. A fundamental question arises of whether we want rural employment. Information technology is meant to be the way forward for rural areas. This is what was argued after the demise of the textile industry, and it was argued that location did not matter if a business had the requisite IT infrastructure.</P>
        <P>With specific regard to Forward Emphasis, I have worked on behalf of the company for many years on several issues. I have lobbied the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on the com<Col N="132"/>pany&rsquo;s need for fixed-line broadband. In the interim, the broadband provider involved in the roll-out of the community broadband initiative e-Hotspot has offered to facilitate Forward Emphasis by offering the company a free three month trial of a satellite system. This has come about through the local IRDL Leader company and the consultant it appointed to deliver the community broadband initiative. There have been some delays in getting this operational because of the company&rsquo;s wish to upgrade the size the dish involved. It is already in the process of being enabled. I hope this will provide an interim solution to the company&rsquo;s requirements.</P>
        <P>Is it possible for fixed broadband to be installed in Malin Head to assist this company, or for the company to be connected to the metropolitan area network planned for Carndonagh? The Malin Head coast guard and the meteorological stations located there may benefit from this type of technology. I ask for State agencies to mentor this and other companies in the area, if this is not already happening, to ensure that needs are met, including broadband requirements. I request that issues raised be taken on board by the interdepartmental group with regard to what I hope will be a successful venture for Donegal, and particularly my area.</P>
        <P>These outstanding issues must be embraced in any plan formulated from the working group. We must be told what the issues are and have solutions. I do not wish to read of more job losses in my area. If supports can be provided, or if supports have been given that could remedy this issue, I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s assistance.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and acknowledge her tireless efforts and representations on behalf of workers threatened by redundancy from Fruit of the Loom and other companies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Forward Emphasis is an outsourced direct marketing services company for financial, government, charity and not-for-profit sectors in the UK. The company is located in Malin, County Donegal, and employs approximately 40 people full time and 60 people part time. In December 1999, Enterprise Ireland approved support for the set up of the company and to date has paid a total of &euro;272,994 in supports. The company commenced operation in late 2000. I understand the promoters established a sister company, Forward Emphasis Limited, in Belfast which provides similar services.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the full range of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s supports are available to Forward Emphasis. These supports include strategy development, production and operations, marketing, human resources development, finance and research and development. In addition, a wide range of support and knowledge is provided by specialists in Enterprise Ireland offices <Col N="133"/>in Ireland and through its 33 offices worldwide. This independent support involves a range of services including identifying new opportunities, providing technical knowledge and expertise, providing market and technical information and promoting to clients both in Ireland and overseas.</P>
        <P>As regards the issue of broadband, I understand from my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. Market forces and the availability of suitable infrastructure and backhaul will determine whether a company offers broadband in any area. A principal reason for the slow roll-out of broadband services generally has been the lack of investment by the private sector in the necessary infrastructure to deliver broadband to all areas.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, in association with the local authorities, using Government and European regional development funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. MANs have already been completed in Gaoth Dobhair and Letterkenny, and MANs for Buncrana and Carndonagh are at the planning stage. I understand, however, that officials from the relevant Department have recently met with representatives from Donegal County Council as well as local interest groups and are currently examining a number of further options.</P>
        <P>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that there have been significant job announcements in Donegal recently, with over 210 new jobs announced recently by Zeus Industrial Products, Letterkenny, and PowerBoard, Burnfoot. These projects are being supported by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland, respectively. This was in addition to 423 jobs announced earlier this year by the Minister, Deputy Martin, for the north-west region. I assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, IDA, El, F&Aacute;S and Donegal County Enterprise Board, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in Donegal. In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also evidenced by ongoing development and support by the agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in Donegal. These include the completion of the IDA Letterkenny business park, the provision of a 25,000 square ft. advance office building at Windyhall, the completion of site development work at Ballyshannon for a new facility and also a development at Buncrana, where the IDA is working with a local developer to provide new manufacturing and office buildings.</P><Col N="134"/>
        <P>In addition to providing support for nine community enterprise centres in Donegal, Enterprise Ireland has also provided substantial support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology business development centre and the development of a marine biotechnology centre. However, it is also recognised that there have been significant job losses in Donegal in recent years, which is why the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has visited Donegal twice since becoming Minister. He has met, in conjunction with the Deputy, many groups and companies on these visits to discuss both the county&rsquo;s difficulties and positive developments. The Deputy will be aware that the Government also recognizes the particular difficulties in Donegal and will be working together to assist in improving the overall environment to increase the attractiveness of Donegal as a location for enterprises. In that context, the recently established interdepartmental group on Donegal, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been asked to report back to my colleague, Deputy Martin, as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that tackling the difficulties in Donegal is a priority for the Government and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the equal opportunities child care programme delivered in the Cootehill community resource centre, located in the Drumnaveil estate. The resource centre was established in 1999 by a voluntary committee and was initially a five-year programme. Grant aid of &pound;50,000 was provided per annum.</P>
        <P>Part of the conditions of the grant was that the group should have a strong focus on the disadvantaged, targeting those most in need. It is acknowledged that the programme is meeting these objectives, which is laudable. The centre is a shining example of what can be achieved by local voluntary committees with some grant aid. We should help these types of committees help themselves and their communities.</P>
        <P>It provides an excellent range of services for upwards of 320 people per month, a great number of people. The services range from a cr&egrave;che, dealing with two year olds to three year olds; to preschool, which deals with three year olds to five year olds; and homework support clubs which deal with four year olds to five year olds. The centre also provides after school activity dealing with children ranging from six to 12 years old. In addition a summer camp is run, which was attended by 80 people this year from locations as far away as Dublin, Belfast and Leitrim. It hopes to increase numbers to 100 people next year.</P>
        <P>The centre provides a range of courses, such as personal development courses in an anti-bullying strategy. This is useful for young people. It also <Col N="135"/>offers relationships and personal development courses targeted at children up to the age of 18, which is the age group that should be targeted in small towns to encourage them to undertake worthwhile programmes. It also deals with statutory bodies. Situations arise where the Health Service Executive refers people to the centre and the VEC makes use of the centre to run a range of night courses. In all, the centre is a wonderful asset for the town of Cootehill.</P>
        <P>However, a problem arises. In 1999, when the course was established for a five-year period, the centre was given grant-aid of &pound;50,000 per year, which would now equate to &euro;63,500. The centre received good news in a letter dated 27 September last, which stated that the course would run for an extra two years and four months and that the centre would be given &euro;124,000 to pay for this extension. However, when the figures were totted up, it became apparent that instead of the 15% increase indicated in the letter, a decrease would apply. There is not enough funding to run the service. If the service were to run at the required level for the period of two years and four months, it would cost &euro;170,000, but that funding has not been provided.</P>
        <P>Given the reduction in funding, the centre must consider other reductions. Three full-time and three part-time staff work at the centre. The options being considered at present are to reduce the number of staff at the centre, to reduce the number of hours they work or, worse, to reduce the number of weeks on which the service is provided to as few as 40 weeks per annum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should not be considering such options. Instead, we should be considering the benefits that this community resource centre is providing to the people of Cootehill. We must also remember that it is targeted at the most disadvantaged and those most in need. We are talking about reducing a service that is led by a voluntary committee. We should seek to increase the level of grant-aid and encourage the centre to provide a greater level of services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The population and demand for services in Cootehill are increasing on an ongoing basis. The centre is well-run and a shining example to the rest of the country. It would hope to be in a position to establish a purpose-built unit on the site, although that is further down the road. We should send a positive signal to those operating the centre that we intend to increase its funding rather than decrease it. The letter to which I referred stated that a 15% increase would apply with effect from 1 September 2005, yet there is a decrease of 20%. The Minister must consider the excellent value the equal opportunities child care programme offers to the people of Cootehill. Adequate funding should be provided to this voluntary committee to help it run this very effective service.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. The Minister for Justice, <Col N="136"/>Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has responsibility for this area of Government policy but his ministerial duties demand his presence elsewhere this evening. Deputy Connolly has referred to a particular facility in Cootehill, County Cavan. To respond to the Deputy it is necessary first to give a brief explanation of the equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP, for which the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government and the progress of the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06 are confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing services to support the child care needs of the parents of Ireland with a particular emphasis on those who may be in employment, or in education or training to prepare for employment. The EOCP has both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion perspective and aims to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55%, or 31,300 additional places, by the end of the programme. Current forecasts of impact suggest that it will ultimately create at least 39,300 places, including over 26,000 which have already been achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first meeting of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 was held within a month of the Government changeover in 1997 and all the evidence shows that child care has been high on our agenda since that time. The Government has consistently moved promptly, purposefully and proactively to facilitate the development of a top quality child care service throughout the country to support parents, the economy and social inclusion through labour market participation. Since the Government was re-elected in 2002, it has further increased the funding provision for the development of child care by over &euro;60 million. This includes part of the additional capital provision of &euro;90 million made available by the Minister for Finance in budget 2005 over the period 2005-09 to develop child care infrastructure, and brings the allocation for the present programme to almost &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that &euro;190,461 in staffing grant assistance under the EOCP was approved for Cootehill Community Resource House in July 2001. Further staffing grant assistance of &euro;124,500 has been approved to cover the period to the end of 2007. The funding approved to the end of 2007 was considered appropriate for the level of service being provided by the group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that the group has recently contacted the child care directorate of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appeal the level of funding approved. This appeal has been forwarded to Pobal, formally known as Area Development Management Limited, which is engaged by the Department to carry out detailed assessments of all EOCP grant applications. The appeal will undergo a thorough assessment by Pobal prior to its recommendation being forwarded to the programme appraisal <Col N="137"/>committee and a decision being made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Pending the outcome of this process, it would be premature of me to comment further on the group&rsquo;s appeal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many child care services throughout County Cavan have benefited from grant assistance under the EOCP. To date, the Minister has announced funding of over &euro;8.3 million for child care in County Cavan, which is supporting the creation of 677 new child care places and 783 existing places throughout the county. The Deputy will be aware of the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, in ensuring that Cavan gets every opportunity to benefit fully from the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since budget 2005 was announced in December 2004, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has announced a record allocation of some &euro;150 million in capital funding for community-based, not-for-profit groups. The availability of the additional capital funding enables the Minister to make further capital grant assistance available to groups which address significant child care service gaps and where the project proposal represents good value for money. It is only fair to emphasise that the equal opportunities child care programme has been central to the recent development of child care in Ireland, which will continue to flourish under the careful stewardship of the Government.</P>

      <sTitle>Sexual Offenders.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This matter concerns the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify his policy on convicted paedophiles while serving prison sentences and after release in the community. It is a serious matter which has been brought to my attention by a number of people and which I want addressed. I am not satisfied the necessary structures are in place to deal with the problem that exists, particularly in light of the Ferns Report.</P>
        <P>Approximately 10% of the prison population at any given time are sex offenders. However, the Government has taken no action to ensure that these offenders have access to treatment and counselling when convicted and serving a custodial sentence in prison. As a result, they leave prison in exactly the same condition that they entered it. This situation is serious, particularly in the case of paedophiles, as they return to the community with the same predatory instincts and intentions as when they entered prison.</P>
        <P>The annual report of the prison chaplains last week demonstrated the stark reality of the lack of counselling for sex offenders in our prisons. The Government response when sex offenders are released from prison is equally irresponsible. Sex offenders are obliged to register with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are put on a register of offenders, but that is the end of the matter. The register is a confidential document and only the <Col N="138"/>most senior members in a Garda station are aware of the identity of a paedophile in a Garda district.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The abused family or families are not necessarily informed that the offender has returned to the local community. In effect, nothing has changed and the sexual predator is free to move in the same circles, with the same opportunities to abuse. When the abused person and his or her family become aware of the situation, they are immediately plunged into a state of fear and frustration. Other children who may have been abused by the same paedophile but who may not have come forward to give evidence at a court case also live in fear, while their parents may be totally unaware of the situation affecting their children. Other children might be exposed to abuse for the first time.</P>
        <P>Released paedophiles who are loose in the community are walking bombshells and will re-offend, as the Ferns Report showed, because they do not see their behaviour as wrong. It is essential for convicted paedophiles to attend comprehensive programmes of treatment and counselling while in prison.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>Equally, it is essential that the register of sex offenders should mean something. There must be provision for supervision of all paedophiles after release and their attendance at treatment and counselling programmes and support groups; for the vulnerable victims and targets of previous abuse and for their parents to be informed of the paedophiles release and whereabouts; and lines of communication must be open at all times between the relevant members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the victims and their parents.</P>
        <P>The findings of the Ferns Inquiry highlighted the need for the State to introduce urgent measures to protect vulnerable children from clerical sexual abuse. It is high time urgent measures were introduced to protect vulnerable children from all forms of sexual abuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter and acknowledge his commitment to reform in the prison sector. I am deputising this evening for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
        <P>The management of sex offenders, both while they are in prison and in the community, is a matter which the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his Department and associated agencies continually consider. Before moving to the substance of this debate, I wish to clarify that my remarks refer to all sex offenders, not just the particular subset who can be classified as paedophiles, although that group raises particular concerns.</P>
        <P>While in prison, every effort is made to assist any offender willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. There are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders operating within <Col N="139"/>the prison system, namely, individual counselling from the Prison Service&rsquo;s <?oasys _ch?>psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the sex offender programme, in operation since 1994; and one-to-one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support for prisoners.</P>
        <P>The second intervention, which receives most media coverage, is the intensive offence-focused group programme. The programme is managed and delivered by members of the probation and welfare service and the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s psychology service. In keeping with international best practice in this area, the programme is a structured, offence-focused programme, employing a cognitive behavioural approach with a relapse prevention component. A total of 114 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date. A further eight men are undertaking the programme in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
        <P>The number of suitably motivated offenders applying for participation on the sex offenders programme has declined in recent years and this is a matter of concern. The Prison Service is examining this situation to determine what measures may be taken to increase the number of offenders participating on the programme. Several additional psychologists have recently been appointed to the Prison Service. These new psychologists will play an important role in working with offenders to address their offending behaviour, including work with sex offenders aimed at enhancing their preparedness for possible participation on the sex offender programme.</P>
        <P>The successful completion of any therapeutic intervention of this nature depends on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals. Continual consideration is given to encouraging prisoners to undertake interventions addressing their sexual offending. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Prison Service and the probation and welfare service are collectively examining all the issues involved in increasing the number of sex offenders attending programmes, both in prison and in the community. As well as looking at how to get prisoners into the current programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they are examining how the services can improve the range of interventions available to offenders, and thereby increase the number of offenders addressing their offending. Their core concern is that any approach proposed <Col N="140"/>should contribute to enhancing societal and community protection.</P>
        <P>Another development in this regard is the Minister&rsquo;s recently announced proposal for new statutory sentencing powers by way of amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The purpose of these new statutory sentencing powers is to provide a real and practical incentive to offenders to deal with issues giving rise to the offending and to stay away from crime.</P>
        <P>These new provisions will, among other things, give a court a statutory power to suspend or partially suspend sentences, other than mandatory sentences, subject to certain conditions. The conditions include a standard condition that the person keeps the peace and is of good behaviour during the period of imprisonment and the period of suspension.</P>
        <P>However, the court may also make its order subject to other conditions. For example, an order may include a condition that the person should undergo drug or other substance abuse treatment or a rehabilitation course for sex offenders, or that the person should agree to be subject to the supervision of the probation and welfare service. Breach of the conditions will result in the imposition of the suspended sentence and the sentence for any offence committed while the first sentence was suspended shall be consecutive on the first sentence.</P>
        <P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides <i>inter alia</i> for notification requirements in relation to convicted sex offenders. Under that Act, the court has a duty to consider imposition of a sentence involving post-release supervision. This allows for the possibility that during a specified period &mdash; the supervision period &mdash; which commences on the date of the offender&rsquo;s release from prison the offender is under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer and is required to comply with such conditions as are specified in the sentence for securing that supervision.</P>
        <P>Conditions may include the requirement that the offender receive psychological counselling or other appropriate treatment provided by the probation and welfare service or any other body which it appears to the court, having regard to any submissions made to it on behalf of the probation and welfare service, is an appropriate body to provide such counselling or treatment.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his Department keep the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 under regular review with a view to ensuring they operate in a satisfactory manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The national climate change strategy provides the basis for Government policy and action to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the most efficient and equitable manner, and for ensuring that Ireland meets its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The strategy identifies a range of policies and measures to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors and is currently under review in my Department so as to take account of developments at national, European and international levels since its publication five years ago.</P>
        <P>While my Department has overall responsibility for the strategy, it is a matter for Departments with direct responsibility for each sector identified in the strategy to implement the optimum mix of policies and measures in order to control and reduce Ireland&rsquo;s overall level of greenhouse gas emissions. To take a few examples from the wide range of measures involved, my Department has made progress in areas such as giving the building regulations a greater focus on energy conservation, the development of planning guidelines on wind energy, reducing emissions from waste facilities and the conversion of National Parks and Wildlife Service vehicles to biofuels. Examples of progress in other sectors include more efficient power generation plants, support for renewable energy, improvements in public transport, tax incentives for more fuel-efficient cars and biofuels, and the recent decision by the Minister for Agriculture to provide support for anaerobic digestion.</P>
        <P>I intend shortly to publish a review document, which will assess progress in implementing the strategy, assess emissions trends across each sector and propose additional measures for Ireland to meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol in the most cost effective way. I will <Col N="142"/>emphasise the need for Ireland to look at this issue in a holistic way, and to take account of our Kyoto requirements when we are setting policies across all the relevant sectors.</P>
        <P>In addition to the policies and measures set out in the national climate change strategy, Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto target will also be achieved through emissions reductions by installations participating in the EU emissions trading scheme and through the purchase by Government of carbon credits sufficient to address any shortfall.</P>

	<P>In the context of its continuing commitment to meeting the range of housing needs, the Government has given careful consideration to the Ninth Progress Report of the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, APOCC, concerning private property, as well as Report No. 112 of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, and a report by Goodbody Economic Consultants.</P>
        <P>The Government has been concerned to develop responses which are practical and focused on delivery and which have regard also to the current background of substantial progress in housing, with record output levels and increased investment in social and affordable housing measures.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Government has already approved the establishment of the affordable homes partnership to drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area; and the preparation of legislative proposals for additional powers should the partnership need these to deliver fully on its mandate.</P><Col N="143"/>
        <P>As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will be asked to review their land management strategies to maximise the availability of land for their own housing programmes, voluntary and co-operative housing, housing partnerships with the private sector and to secure more active use of brownfield land and derelict sites. My Department will communicate with local authorities in this regard shortly.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is giving detailed consideration to a possible &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; scheme that could entail compulsory acquisition of land for housing purposes at below market value in specified circumstances, and to the treatment of land purchase options.</P>
        <P>In relation to recommendations in the APOCC report concerning infrastructure, my Department is preparing a strategic infrastructure Bill which, among other things, will provide a mechanism to accelerate delivery of relevant infrastructure, amend the requirement for property referencing prior to compulsory acquisition of land, and modify the right to compensation for the acquisition of subsurface property rights.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 73 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>As I have previously indicated, Government efforts and resources, together with those of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, are continuing to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P><Col N="144"/>
        <P>The Government has over the years, largely through the RPII, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations. The RPII has long been encouraging householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</P>
        <P>Increasing the awareness of the public is considered to be a more effective approach than the introduction of a demand-led scheme of domestic radon remediation grants, which could require very significant public expenditure. Radon grant schemes are not operated by the majority of EU member states.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging that recent research commissioned by the RPII has found that 75% of the general population are aware of radon. In addition, there has been an increase of more than 150% in the number of radon measurements undertaken by householders during 2004 compared with previous years. That indicates the increasing effectiveness of the RPII&rsquo;s radon public awareness campaign.</P>
        <P>My Department introduced upgraded building regulations in June 1997, which required all new houses commencing construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. In October 2004, an updated edition of my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture), incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing construction on or after 1 April 2005, was published. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.</P>
        <P>In February 2002, a booklet from my Department entitled Radon in Existing Buildings &mdash; Corrective Options, became available. This booklet advises designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to, or below, the national reference level.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that a recent European study shows that, for those exposed to similar concentrations of radon, the risk of contracting lung cancer is 25 times greater for those who smoke, and that the vast majority of the radon-induced lung cancer cases occur among smokers and ex-smokers.</P>

	<P>Architectural protection grants in respect of protected structures are available from local authorities. These are resourced by my Department, with an increase in overall funding of 75% from &euro;3.9 million in 2004 to &euro;6.85 million in 2005.</P>
        <P>Conservation grants are available directly from my Department, with &euro;1.033 million available in 2005 to support projects on buildings of architectural or heritage significance which are in the ownership of public bodies, civic trusts etc. and are open to the public.</P>
        <P>In 2005, &euro;700,000 has been allocated in thatching grants by my Department, with grants having being provisionally approved for 152 roofs.</P>
        <P>On 7 November I announced the establishment of a steering group to advise on proposals for governance of the Irish Heritage Trust so that a workable and effective trust can be established as quickly as possible. The steering group is charged with reporting back to me no later than January 2006 and I expect the trust to be established very soon thereafter. The Minister for Finance is considering the provision of appropriate tax concessions to support the trust.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding for architectural heritage protection is also provided by the Heritage Council. In addition, tax relief is available under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of an approved building or garden meeting required opening hours requirements. Further protection is afforded through the ongoing maintenance of the State&rsquo;s own portfolio of historic properties. I am satisfied that, taken together, these provisions afford appropriate support for the conservation and protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

        <P>The report of the working group established to review the management of dog breeding establishments was submitted to me on 7 September 2005. The report contains a number of useful recommendations including in relation to the introduction of statutorily enforceable standards for the dog breeding industry in Ireland and proposes the introduction of a registration system for dog breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>On 20 October 2005, I announced a public consultation process on foot of the working group&rsquo;s report indicating that, in view of the many divergent views on the issue, I wanted to canvass public opinion more widely before taking final decisions on the matter. An advertisement inviting submissions was placed in the national newspapers on Monday, 24 October 2005. The closing date for receipt of submissions is Friday, 16 December 2005.</P>
        <P>I will further consider all of the recommendations in the report of the working group, including those relating to the introduction of legislation, following the conclusion of the consultation process.</P>

	<P>The general scheme of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill was approved by the Government in June 2005. The Bill&rsquo;s main purpose is to improve the efficiency of the planning system in relation to major infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The key features of the Bill will be the restructuring of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to establish a new, permanent strategic infrastructure division which will handle decisions on all major infrastructure projects; an extension of the board&rsquo;s role to include decisions on railways, gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines; and major transport, environmental and energy projects proposed by the private sector that are of strategic importance <Col N="147"/>will be referred directly to the board and will not need local planning permission.</P>
        <P>I have secured an additional 24 staff for the board to be recruited on a phased basis to deal both with the continuing increases in planning appeals received by the board, as well as the need to set up the strategic infrastructure division. I intend to monitor progress on the establishment of the new division closely as the Bill progress through the Houses in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Drafting of the Bill, which involves complex amendments to several different legislative codes, is at this stage well advanced and I expect to publish it early in 2006 with a view to early enactment.</P>

	<P>The 1990 regulations banning the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal were originally made to address the winter smog situation prevalent in the Dublin area at that time, and have since been extended to 15 other areas taking account of air quality monitoring data and population size.</P>
        <P>A June 2002 voluntary agreement between my Department and the Solid Fuel Trade Group provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the delivery of significantly cleaner standards for bituminous coal and petcoke on a phased basis. Under this agreement, there is at present a temporary moratorium on the designation of further coal ban areas during the life of the agreement except where required to ensure adherence to air quality standards.</P>
        <P>The agreement is currently undergoing a final review and discussions with the Solid Fuel Trade Group have been under way for some time with a view to further improving the environmental performance of the solid fuel sector. Pending completion of the review and the discussions with the Solid Fuel Trade Group, I have no plans to extend the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal. I expect the review and the discussions to be completed shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 29, 86 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume, AEV, is the first step in the Estimates process and does not take account of any further adjustments, particularly in relation to capital provision which may be announced on budget day. The 5% increase in the 2006 provision for housing, announced in the AEV, corresponds to an investment programme of &euro;1.3 billion in 2006. This is a significant financial commitment and maintains the momentum of a sustained period of investment in housing in recent years.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, over &euro;7 billion in funding has been provided under a range of social and affordable housing programmes and at the end of this year that investment will have met the needs of some 100,000 households.</P>
        <P>The 2006 provision will reinforce this progress and it is anticipated that the needs of over 13,000 households will be met next year, including some 5,500 completions under the main local authority programme; 1,850 units to be completed by the voluntary and co-operative sector; and continued focus on regeneration and delivery of some 3,000 units of affordable housing.</P>
        <P>The commitment to multi-annual capital programmes and the introduction of five-year local authority action plans for housing provide a strong strategic framework for the major investment programme in progress. The NDP provides the development strategy at national level and while output levels for social housing have been less than anticipated, housing has made an <Col N="149"/>important contribution to infrastructural development and social inclusion. Investment in the 2000-04 period under the NDP, at &euro;6.86 billion, was almost 10% ahead of forecast expenditure and has resulted in record levels of completions.</P>
        <P>There have been major advances in housing over the past decade. The overall supply has increased dramatically and the options open to people seeking to avail of social and affordable housing have improved. The AEV has once again provided for record levels of funding for the broad range of social and affordable housing. I am confident that with local authority action plans in place, supported by the significant levels of investment that I have outlined, real benefits will be seen in terms of both the output and the quality of social housing provision and in a reduction of numbers on waiting lists in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 53 together.</P>
        <P>I met Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman, and Sir Ian Roxburgh, chief executive, of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, NDA, along with the UK Ambassador to Ireland, on 17 November 2005. The meeting reflected the improved co-operation arrangements currently in place between the UK and the Irish Governments in relation to nuclear safety issues.</P>
        <P>The NDA was established by the UK Government in April 2005 to assume responsibility for the decommissioning and clean up of the UK nuclear waste legacy. It now has responsibility for the clean up and decommissioning of 20 nuclear sites in the United Kingdom, including Sellafield. It is required to operate in an open and transparent manner and consult with stakeholders. I am pleased that consultation processes between this new authority and Ireland are already well established and recognise Ireland as an important stakeholder in the work of the NDA.</P>
        <P>A detailed briefing was provided to me in relation to the NDA mandate, work programme and strategies. In response, I emphasised that safe and environmentally friendly decommissioning of nuclear facilities and the proposals of NDA to deal with legacy waste hazards can in principle be welcomed by Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, I emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s continuing concerns regarding the discharge of radioactive <Col N="151"/>waste to the Irish Sea and advised that decommissioning operations must not result in radioactive discharges to the marine environment. I also raised concerns in relation to a number of other issues which are currently the responsibility of and under deliberation by the NDA. These issues included our significant safety concerns in relation to the operation of the THORP plant following the leak in April 2005, the need for the UK Government to end reprocessing, future plans by the authority in relation to plutonium stocks held at Sellafield, ensuring that safety standards are not compromised in any way by efficiency drives or the use of contractors, and the concerns in relation to threats posed by rising sea levels and coastal erosion to the radioactive waste disposal facility at Drigg in the UK. These concerns, including those relating to Drigg, are also the subject of a submission by my Department, based on the expert advice provided by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, to the extensive consultation processes established by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</P>
        <P>My meeting with the Ambassador and the NDA representatives produced a valuable exchange of views. While the perspectives of the Irish and UK Governments are markedly different in relation to nuclear issues and remain so, I believe the significant diplomatic and legal initiatives taken by this Government have raised the awareness of the UK Government to Irish concerns. My Department, with the benefit of expert advice from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will remain fully engaged with the operation of the NDA through the extensive consultation processes provided and will utilise such processes where it is considered Ireland&rsquo;s interests may or will be affected.</P>

        <P>The function of the Irish Heritage Trust is to acquire for public access major important heritage properties which the State may not be in a position to acquire or manage directly and where there is imminent risk to the heritage value of the property through neglect or an appropriate use cannot be brought forward through sale to a private investor. The terms of the trust will be sufficiently broad to allow it to acquire other properties and land of heritage value, but it is envisaged that any extension of its activities will only happen once it has gained experience in relation to heritage buildings.</P>
        <P>On 7 November 2005 I announced the establishment of a small but broadly based steering group to advise on the finalisation of the trust arrangements. The group which has the experience and knowledge necessary for this task is to report to me by January next.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 30 and 84 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the making, by planning authorities, of development contribution schemes which set out the basis for the determination of the scheme and the contributions to be paid in respect of the different classes of public infrastructure and facilities. In my Department&rsquo;s circular letter PD 4/2003 of 27 June 2003 planning authorities were advised that while it was expected that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, care should be taken to avoid development contributions that are excessively high. Development contributions schemes are adopted following a statutory public consultation phase, during which my Department has an opportunity to comment on the draft schemes. The final schemes, including the level of contribution, are adopted by the democratically elected members of the planning authorities and it is a matter for each local authority to make a judgment on what is appropriate in their area.</P>
        <P>Development contributions should not unduly affect the price of houses and level of inflation. The major driver of house price increases in recent years has been the demand for housing, fuelled by rapid economic growth and demographic changes. The Government have responded to this unprecedented demand by focusing on measures to boost supply as the most appropriate way to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases. The key component of this strategy is ensuring a supply of serviced land for housing which the development contribution system helps fund.</P>
        <P>Development contributions continue to be attached as a condition of planning permission, and therefore paid by the person carrying out the development in advance of construction starting. They are not paid by individual house purchasers.</P>

	<P>A formal response by Ireland to the judgment of the European Court of Justice issued to the European Commission on 21 October 2005 detailing the measures now being taken in terms of the structures, legislation and policy approach to ensure the implementation of the provisions of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste, as amended by Council Directive 91/156/EEC of 18 March 1991, and thereby fulfil the obligations imposed by the directive.</P>
        <P>The response includes information on the establishment of the Office of Environmental Enforcement and its National Enforcement Network, which has greatly raised awareness and brought a more co-ordinated and systematic approach to environmental enforcement. Special training has been rolled out, procedures for site visits are being developed, a new national complaints procedure was launched on 22 September 2005 and a national waste complaints information line is being developed. This has been backed up with State funding of over &euro;7.5 million, which has led to over 110 additional enforcement officers being appointed across the local authorities permitting a greatly enhanced response on the ground with targeted exercises, road blocks, waste audits and port inspections.</P>
        <P>These initiatives will add to the capacity to respond to situations more effectively. In general I am satisfied that these institutional and operational developments better equip the national and local enforcement authorities to meet the challenge posed by environmental crime, especially in the area of waste.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 552 and 554 together.</P>
        <P>The improvement of non-national roads in its area is a matter for each individual road authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by grants provided by my Department. Responsibility for national roads is a matter for the relevant road authority and the National Roads Authority which operates under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P><Col N="156"/>
        <P>Consultants have recently completed a new pavement condition study of non-national roads and a review of pavement management systems for my Department. The study is essentially a needs analysis which is critical to the proper planning of the non-national roads restoration programme over the coming years.</P>
        <P>From 1997 to the end of 2004 the total grant assistance provided by my Department in respect of non-national roads was some &euro;2.9 billion. Of this, almost &euro;1.5 billion was paid to local authorities in respect of works under the restoration programme. In 2005, I have allocated of &euro;495.27 million to non-national roads, including &euro;234.222 million to the restoration programme. The 2005 allocation represents the highest level of funding ever provided for non-national roads and is more than double the 1997 allocation.</P>
        <P>By the end of this year nearly 80% of the deficient non-national road network identified in the 1996 pavement condition study will have been restored to good condition.</P>
        <P>The results of the new study will form an important part of the ongoing process of determining the investment needs of the non-national road network to address the impact of traffic volume growth. I am currently considering the results of the study and how best to implement the recommendations. I intend to announce road grant allocations for 2006 in respect of non-national roads early in the new year.</P>

	<P>Statutory protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities to whom my Department provides advice in the exercise of their functions in that regard under the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority is required, for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical <Col N="159"/>interest, to include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This may be done at the time of the preparation of the development plan or, where appropriate, at any other time.</P>
        <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them but also to safeguard their future.</P>

        <P>Analysis of plastic bag levy receipts on a quarterly basis in respect of transactions up to 30 October 2005 indicate a consistent pattern in the flow of income from the levy.

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities are required to make a scheme of letting priorities to determine the order of priority to be afforded to applicants in the lettings of dwellings provided by the authority. The order of priority of different categories of persons in such schemes and the basis on which applicants are assessed are matters primarily for decision by the local authority.</P>
        <P>In the context of its overview of schemes of letting priorities, my Department continues to advise local authorities of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different types of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking local authority and voluntary housing in the future.</P>
        <P>The guidelines issued by my Department to local authorities indicate that schemes of letting priorities should aim to promote equality of access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs to ensure that a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of needy persons is at a permanent disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other categories. There are no proposals for further guidelines to local authorities on this issue.</P>

	<P>I have not received such correspondence, but I am relaying the Deputy&rsquo;s concern to the Office of Environmental Enforcement.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of environmental legislation is a matter for local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement. Under section 59 of the Waste Management Act 1996, each local authority is responsible for the holding, recovery or disposal of waste within its functional area. The office, using its powers under section 63 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities through auditing their performance, providing advice and guidance and, in appropriate cases, giving binding directions. My Department has no function in these matters.</P>

	<P>The latest available inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, compiled annually by the Environmental Protection Agency, shows that emissions for the entire transport sector for 2003 were 11.85 million tonnes CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> equivalent, an increase of 130% since 1990. The inventory shows that emissions of C02 from road transport increased by 135% between 1990 and 2003. However, statistics for emissions of carbon dioxide from specific categories of motor vehicles are not available as emissions are calcu<Col N="162"/>lated on the basis of fuel sold rather than vehicle type.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy identifies a range of policies and measures to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors. Measures addressed to the transport sector include vehicle efficiency improvements, taxation measures and measures to promote modal shift. In this context, a 50% reduction in vehicle registration tax for hybrid-electric cars is available until the end of 2006. Separately, &euro;6 million in excise relief was granted by the Minister for Finance in August 2005 for a two-year pilot scheme to stimulate the development of the biofuels sector in Ireland. Both of these initiatives will promote the use of lower emission vehicles.</P>
        <P>In the context of the review of the national climate change strategy, the potential for further taxation measures to favour the purchase and use of vehicles with lower carbon dioxide emissions will be examined.</P>

	<P>The compilation and publication of the register is a matter for each registration authority in accordance with electoral law and involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local inquiries, including in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion. The draft register is published on 1 November each year and is made available for examination at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February.</P>
        <P>Each year, my Department undertakes an advertising campaign to coincide with the publication of the draft register to encourage electors to check the draft and ensure that they are correctly registered. In recent years, the advertising campaign has included elements specifically targeted at young people.</P>
        <P>Students who live away from home while attending college have the choice of being registered at their home address or their student residential address. Students pursuing a course of study on a full-time basis at an educational institution in the State who are registered at but living away from home and cannot attend their polling station may apply for entry in the postal voters list.</P>
        <P>Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, the grounds for making application for entry in the supplement to the register were widened to <Col N="163"/>allow a person who reaches 18 years of age on or before polling day to apply for entry in the supplement to the register; previously, the cut-off point was the closing date for the supplement.</P>
        <P>While the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register depend to a significant extent on the co-operation and engagement of the individual citizen, I will keep under review the scope for further initiatives to help registration authorities identify and target young people in this regard.</P>

	<P>In view of the importance of the thatched roof as part of our built heritage, I established a steering group of key interests and agencies in Ireland and Northern Ireland to commission the recently published report on the present and future protection of thatched structures in Ireland. A copy is available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
        <P>The report includes useful data for owners of thatched buildings, their professional advisers and the building industry, including a list of thatchers, suppliers of thatching materials and insurers of thatched houses. I have invited comment and feedback from all stakeholders in order to develop an improved approach to conserving the surviving stock of thatched buildings. Some of the actions proposed in the report are already being implemented, and a number of local authorities have commissioned inventories of the thatched buildings in their areas.</P>
        <P>My Department provides thatching grants set at two-thirds of the approved cost, subject to a maximum of &euro;3,810 in respect of non-medical card holders, rising to 80% of the cost or a maximum of &euro;6,350 in respect of medical card <Col N="164"/>holders. In the case of a house situated on certain specified islands off the west and south coasts of Ireland, the maxima are &euro;5,714 and &euro;8,252, respectively. These grants are payable in respect of necessary works of renewing or repairing existing thatched roofs of houses where the conditions of the scheme are met. Details regarding payments made under the scheme are available in the housing statistics bulletin, which is available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 56 and 115 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every consumer can now deposit waste electrical and electronic equipment free of charge. If a new item is being purchased, the retailer must accept an equivalent waste item on a one-for-one basis. Alternatively, items can be brought to the local civic amenity site. These facilities for consumers arise from the implementation, from 13 August 2005 onwards, of the EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, which required each member state to introduce regulations providing for a producer funded take-back scheme.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the directive involved the establishment of three new structures: two compliance schemes to fund the recovery of the waste equipment, WEEE Ireland limited and the European Recycling Platform, ERP; and an independent national producer registration body, WEEE register, whose job it is to register all producers of electronic and electrical equipment, determine market share and approve visible environmental management costs, EMCs, where these are dis<Col N="165"/>played by producers. More than 640 producers have registered to date with WEEE register and it is estimated that in the first 12 weeks of implementation, approximately 4,600 tonnes of WEEE has been collected.</P>
        <P>Local authority civic amenity facilities now accept all items of WEEE, within the scope of the directive, from householders free of charge. The latest figures collated by my Department show that there were 64 local authority civic amenity sites in operation throughout the country at the end of 2004 and a further five are understood to have opened to date during 2005. Some 39 of these civic amenity sites have been part funded through the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme, which is designed to assist local authorities in the provision of recycling and recovery infrastructure. Funding has been committed to another 17 facilities which are being developed at present. Some are at a more advanced stage than others. In considering further civic amenity facilities for grant assistance in the last round, I gave priority to those providing facilities for the collection of WEEE. A further 40 projects are under consideration by the Department, some of which are still at a very preliminary stage.</P>
        <P>While the funding of such take-back schemes is a producer responsibility, the directive allows producers for a transitional period of eight years &mdash; ten years for large household appliances &mdash; to show purchasers, at the time of sale of new products, the costs of recovery and recycling of &ldquo;historic&rdquo; waste, which was put on the market before 13 August 2005. While there were varying opinions on how the provisions regarding the historic waste should operate, the majority view among the industry and the independent retail sector, for reasons of fuller transparency and greater accountability, favoured a system of visible EMCs in the manner which has been provided for under the regulations. The design of the new system assures the public that the moneys collected for recycling are actually assigned for recycling activity and are not diverted elsewhere. It also ensures traceability and financial accountability and, by informing the public in an open way, ensures that profiteering is prevented.</P>
        <P>Visible EMCs are designed solely to cover the cost of recycling of WEEE. None of the revenue involved is handled by the Government. The WEEE register society limited &mdash; the industry-based national WEEE registration body &mdash; will monitor the implementation of the scheme and adjust the visible EMCs periodically to ensure that the not-for-profit principle is observed. Producers pay the appropriate EMCs into the producer recycling funds operated by the two approved collective compliance schemes operating in Ireland; WEEE Ireland and ERP. Visible EMCs are input costs and how these are dealt with in the pricing of products is part of the normal negotiations between producer and retailer. Market forces determine whether <Col N="166"/>increases in any input costs, whether it is in respect of EMCs, raw materials, transport etc., are absorbed or passed on.</P>
        <P>The new regime represents good value for money. The public can either dispose of this waste on a one-for-one basis or bring it to their local civic amenity site free of charge and this represents a considerable saving to them compared to previous waste disposal costs. It provides a &ldquo;cradle-to-grave&rdquo; system for the management of WEEE. While there has been criticism in this House in the past over delays in transposing EU directives, it is creditable in this case that Ireland is one of only a small number of member states which have fully implemented this directive by the due date. My Department is monitoring the operation of the scheme closely and where barriers to effective implementation are identified, these will be addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s policy statement Changing Our Ways, September 1998, which provided a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans under which specific national objectives and targets would be achieved, set out specific targets for the recycling of construction and demolition waste of at least 50% by end 2003, rising progressively to at least 85% by end 2013.</P>
        <P>A national construction and demolition waste council was established by the construction industry in June 2002 as a voluntary producer responsibility initiative to facilitate the achievement of the national construction and demolition waste recycling targets. In September 2004, the council launched its voluntary construction industry initiative which involves all key participants in the <Col N="168"/>construction industry committing to a series of specific actions that have the overall objective of increasing recycling rates for construction and demolition waste. The initiative aims to concentrate on the major waste fractions in the early years and establish the most suitable practices for Ireland through practical experience. It is envisaged that further steps will be initiated at a later stage to focus on the remaining elements of construction and demolition waste.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the launch of the voluntary construction industry initiative, my Department issued new draft best practice guidelines on the preparation of waste management plans for construction and demolition projects for public consultation. The aim of the draft guidelines is to promote an integrated approach to construction and demolition waste management throughout the duration of a project and to ensure the projects are designed to promote sustainable development, environmental protection and optimum use of resources. The guidelines introduce the concept of on-site construction and demolition waste management plans which would apply to projects above certain specified thresholds. It is my intention to finalise the draft guidelines as soon as possible following the completion of a comprehensive evaluation of the submissions recently received from the public consultation process. The finalised guidelines will be submitted to the national construction and demolition waste council for its formal endorsement.</P>
        <P>The preparation and publication of national waste statistics is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency and these statistics are published at three-yearly intervals by the agency. The most recent national waste database report in respect of 2001, which was published in July 2003, is the most comprehensive up-to-date source of information regarding waste arisings, infrastructure and management. The 2001 database report estimated that out of total construction and demolition waste arisings of 3,615,163 tonnes in that year, 2,364,866 tonnes &mdash; 65.4% &mdash; were recovered. This represented an increase from 1,171,572 tonnes recovered, or 43.3%, in 1998. The agency anticipates that the next full database report, in respect of 2004, will be available for publication by end 2005.</P>

	<P>The estimate mentioned in the <Col N="169"/>question, while referred to in the NESC report, does not arise from the NESC but from a team of researchers assembled by four non-governmental organisations to study the first round of housing strategies prepared by local authorities. This study, entitled an analysis of housing strategies and homeless action plans, 2002, estimated that approximately one-third of new households to be formed in the state between 2001 and 2005 would fall below affordability thresholds. However, the researchers also expressed some concerns, which are reiterated by the NESC, about the accuracy of the calculations as they found wide variation in estimates of affordability across the different housing strategies, and reckoned that some over-estimation had occurred.</P>
        <P>The NESC suggested that the methodology in the housing strategies for estimating affordability problems and experience in using them will improve as local authorities review and update their strategies. The issue of those falling below affordable housing thresholds has implications for local authorities&rsquo; social and affordable housing programmes and the assessment of the contribution required from developers under Part V of the planning and development Acts 2000-2004. In developing this approach, account has to be taken of the likely level of housing at affordable levels to be produced by the private market within the area of the plan.</P>
        <P>Five-year action plans for social and affordable housing programmes covering the period to 2008 have been developed by local authorities, at the request of my Department, in order to ensure that available resources are used to best effect in responding to the broad range of housing needs. A mid-term review of plans will be undertaken next year which will allow for adjustments to be made in light of actual performance and any new housing policy initiatives arising in the interim.</P>
        <P>Investment in housing in 2006 will be &euro;2 billion, more than double the investment as recently as 2000. This will further increase the output of social and affordable housing. It is anticipated that support for affordable housing measures should lead to the needs of some 12,000 new households being met between 2005 and 2007. The Government is giving careful consideration to the broad range of issues raised by the NESC and will consider whatever changes are required to better focus its efforts. We have already established the affordable homes partnership to drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area. A new statement of housing policy will be issued soon.</P>

	<P>My Department actively promotes the conservation of fuel and energy through Part L of the national building regulations and the related technical guidance document L. Progressively higher thermal performance and insulation standards introduced under Part L since 1992 have significantly reduced the energy required, from all sources, to heat space and water in buildings. For example, it is estimated that the increased Part L standards for dwellings, which came into effect on 1 January 2003, will reduce domestic heating requirements by between 23% and 33%, depending on the type of building, and will, by 2012, reduce CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> emis<Col N="171"/>sions from dwellings by 300,000 tonnes per annum. This delivers on a commitment made in the national climate change strategy, October 2000.</P>
        <P>With regard to windows, Part L of the building regulations effectively requires double-glazed windows incorporating energy efficient low-e glass or equivalent in new houses including local authority houses. This requirement was extended with effect from 1 July 2003 to cover replacement windows in existing houses. In this regard my Department provides funding to local authorities under a variety of schemes which entail the use of energy saving measures. For example, funding is provided to local authorities under the remedial works scheme for refurbishment work to houses in their stock, which includes the installation of central heating, the upgrading of insulation, where necessary, and the replacement of windows and doors. My Department also provides separate funding to local authorities for the installation of central heating and related energy improvement measures in their housing stock.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 503 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; ie, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics, silage bale wrap and sheeting &mdash; are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or, alternatively, to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish farm film producers group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P>Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and it is a matter for the company, under the terms of this producer responsibility initiative and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, to set a rate of levy which will cover its operational costs. The detailed information sought regarding the company&rsquo;s operations is a matter for the company and is not available in my Department.</P>
        <P>The scheme has operated successfully to date. It is estimated that approximately 8,500 tonnes &mdash; some 55% &mdash; of farm plastics placed on the market in 2004 were collected for recycling. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of the collection service in 2004. The IFFPG estimates that over 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics have been collected in 2005. While responsibility for the collection and recovery of farm plastics rests with the compliance scheme, my Department monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis. I am aware of the <Col N="173"/>specific issues raised and I am anxious to preserve and continue the success of the farm plastic scheme. Discussions are taking place involving my Department and the IFFPG to explore options for improvement to the scheme and resolution of outstanding issues.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the international legal action taken by the Government with a view to securing the closure of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36557/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government initiated international legal proceedings against the UK under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, with regard to the Sellafield MOX plant. The current position regarding the litigation by Ireland under UNCLOS is that the arbitration remains suspended pending resolution of jurisdictional issues in the dispute, which were raised by the European Commission. These issues are now the subject of legal proceedings between Ireland and the Commission before the European Court of Justice and a court hearing of the case took place on 8 November last. In line with normal procedure in such matters, the Advocate General indicated that his opinion on the matter will be made available on 18 January 2006 and the judgment of the court will issue subsequently.</P>
        <P>The tribunal in the UNCLOS case issued an order on 24 June 2003 after hearing an application by Ireland for provisional measures. The provisional measures award and orders recommended that Ireland and the UK enter into dialogue to improve co-operation and consultation between the two Governments and report to the tribunal on specified dates. The most recent report to the tribunal was submitted on schedule by both parties on 31 May 2005 and the next report is due to be submitted to the tribunal tomorrow. In line with the obligation on both parties to improve co-operation and co-ordination arrangements, complex discussions, confidential to the tribunal and the parties pending outcomes, are at present continuing.</P>
        <P>It was my stated intention to report on progress arising from this process at the appropriate instance and the signing of an agreement on notification and exchange of information arrangements between Ireland and the UK on 10 December 2004 afforded the two parties an opportunity to do so. The agreed package of measures announced is designed to address a wide range of issues related to nuclear safety and includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the facilitating of visits to Sellafield by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; provision of <Col N="174"/>access for the institute to the UK&rsquo;s radiation monitoring system, RIMNET; and a series of initiatives to develop and improve existing co-operation arrangements between both governments.</P>
        <P>The current position regarding these measures is that both the institute and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have visited Sellafield during the past 12 months and further visits are planned by both bodies. Earlier this year the institute published a report of its visit to Sellafield in September 2004. With regard to RIMNET, the institute now has full access to the real-time information provided by the system.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s programme for Government to use every legal and diplomatic opportunity to secure the orderly closure of Sellafield, both I and my Department utilise all bilateral and multilateral opportunities to articulate Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding Sellafield. Considerable opportunities arise at international fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the European Union and the OSPAR Commission to advance our views on issues such as marine transport of nuclear waste, nuclear safety, and radioactive discharges to the marine environment. All these issues have direct relevance to Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding Sellafield and I intend to continue Ireland&rsquo;s proactive engagement at these and other fora with a view to maximising support for our policies among like-minded states.</P>

	<P>Since the national parks and wildlife service came within the remit of my Department in 2002, the allocation to the service has been increased by almost 57%, from &euro;22.45 million to the 2006 abridged Estimate provision of &euro;35.23 million. In determining the 2006 provision, I have had regard to the lower than anticipated outturn for the service in 2005, which is due to slower than planned progress on some capital projects. The 2006 provision, therefore, provides for a significant real increase in 2006 on the anticipated 2005 outturn.</P>

	<P>It is the responsibility for the Irish Aviation Authority to licence airports and aerodromes, having regard primarily to aviation safety. Provision for licensing is made in a statutory instrument under the Irish Aviation Act 1993, which comes within the remit of the Minister for Transport.</P><Col N="176"/>
        <P>With regard to ground-based facilities, the position is, as stated in reply to Question 429 of 16 November 2005, that any consequential land-use developments arising from a change in designation of an airport or aerodrome or any increase in activity would have to be dealt with by the relevant planning authority in accordance with the planning code.</P>
        <P>Under section 11(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may take whatever measures it considers necessary to consult with, <i>inter alia</i>, transport infrastructure providers when it is reviewing its development plan to ascertain any long-term plans for the provision of infrastructure and services in the area of the authority and the provider must supply the necessary information to the authority.

Local authorities are being urged to address this issue both with regard to their own accommodation and in discussions with the voluntary sector active in the housing area. Initiatives currently being undertaken in a number of areas regarding the provision of tenancy sustainment services will assist in this process. I am confident that we will see a significant increase in assistance to homeless persons under these headings from now on.</P>
        <P>Funding available from my Department for recoupment to local authorities of costs incurred in the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons in 2005 is &euro;51 million. This brings to &euro;240 million the total funding available from my Department for this purpose since the implementation of the integrated strategy in 2000. In addition, some &euro;106 million was provided by the Department of Health and Children for care-related services in the same period.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 501, 527 and 539 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission on 29 July 2005. Last month, I issued a consultation paper, together with the text of draft regulations to give legal effect to the action programme. The closing date for comments was 4 November 2005.</P>
        <P>A total of 76 submissions were received from a wide range of stakeholders, including farming organisations, co-operatives, local authorities and other interested parties. My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food have reviewed the submissions received and I expect to make the final regulations in early December. This will allow Ireland to pursue with the European Commission and other member states our case for a derogation from the limit set by the directive in appropriate cases.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s original proposal for a derogation from the general livestock manure limit &mdash; 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year &mdash; laid down in the nitrates directive was submitted to the Commission in November 2004. This has now been updated and submitted informally to the Commission. Our proposal is designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions <Col N="180"/>and controls, up to a level of 250 kg. The scope of the derogation being sought will cater not only for intensive dairy farmers who may need a derogation for their own farming activities, but also caters specifically for grassland holdings importing manure from intensive pig and poultry farms.</P>
        <P>To assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates action programme and regulations, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has announced details of a proposed revised farm waste management scheme for which EU approval is now being sought. Under these proposals, pig and poultry producers will be eligible for the first time for on-farm investment aid and grants of up to 70% will be available. Among other new elements, the scheme will introduce a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to maximum eligible investment of &euro;80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs and &euro;40,000 in the case of specialized slurry spreading tankers and related equipment. The scheme will increase the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from &euro;11,000 to &euro;15,000 with the grant rate remaining at 20%. Issues such as Teagasc recommendations and REP scheme 3 specifications are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

It highlights the European Commission&rsquo;s determination to achieve full implementation of the directive by the final deadline of 30 October 2007.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the directive in Ireland is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 and 2003 and related regulations. It is my view that Ireland is well placed to meet the directive&rsquo;s requirements within the required timeframe.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 83 and 117 together.</P>
        <P>The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority in accordance with electoral law and includes the carrying out of house-to-house enquiries, delivery of registration forms and running local awareness campaigns. It is the duty of registration authorities to ensure as far as possible the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register. In carrying out this work, registration authorities depend to a significant degree on the co-operation and engagement of the general public.</P>
        <P>The focus of my Department&rsquo;s work with regard to the register is to support and assist registration authorities through, <i>inter alia</i>, ensuring that an appropriate legislative framework is in place, developing best practice guidance for registration authorities and overseeing related national awareness campaigns.</P>
        <P>In this regard, on 14 July 2005, my Department requested registration authorities to take all necessary steps to secure significant improvement in the quality of the register for their areas in 2006-07. New best practice guidance on preparing and maintaining the register has been drafted in my Department. The guidance has been sent to registration authorities, returning officers and the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government for comment prior to finalisation. In view of the importance of the matter, authorities were asked on 10 November 2005 to implement the guidance immediately, including the carrying out by authorities of reviews of procedures used in compiling the register. A national awareness campaign associated with preparation of the next register has also recently concluded.</P>
        <P>I will continue to keep these issues, including the scope for further improvements, under review. In this regard, the issue of use of PPS numbers in the context of electoral registration is being examined in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other relevant interests. In taking forward work regarding the register generally, it will be important to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, the requirement to maintain the security and integrity of the electoral process and, on the other, providing for a reasonable degree of flexibility in arrangements for registration.</P>

	<P>The agreed programme for Government includes a commitment regarding developing further the concept of community gain in association with the delivery of major infrastructure projects. This would build on specific examples already to hand where planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la have attached conditions to permissions requiring the provision of necessary community facilities in parallel with infrastructure development. In the context of the forthcoming Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill, I propose to include a mechanism whereby An Bord Plean&aacute;la could attach conditions providing for community gain to consents for strategic infrastructure. I intend to publish this Bill early in 2006.</P>

	<P>Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs, was due to be transposed into national legislation by 21 April 2002, that is, within 18 months after the publication of the directive on 21 October 2000. <Col N="184"/>My Department has been actively engaged with the society for the Irish motor industry, the Irish motor vehicle recyclers association, the metal recyclers association of Ireland and other stakeholders since before the adoption of the directive with regard to the effective implementation.</P>
        <P>While enabling provisions to facilitate implementation of the directive were incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, regulations on the detailed arrangements for implementation of the directive in Ireland have yet to be made. The delay in fully transposing and implementing the directive is primarily due to difficulties encountered in reaching agreement with the relevant sectors on the detailed mechanisms for the operation of the free ELV take-back arrangements required by the directive.</P>
        <P>Against this background, my Department has held a number of meetings with the relevant sectors with a view to developing an effective and pragmatic approach to implement the directive in Ireland. On foot of these discussions, it is my intention to announce draft regulations shortly which will facilitate the full transposition and implementation of the directive&rsquo;s provisions when made.</P>
        <P>Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise was due to be transposed by 18 July 2004. The provisions of the directive with regard to noise-mapping are already being implemented in part and progress is being achieved in this regard. Regulations to transpose the directive are at an advanced stage of drafting and I intend to make them shortly.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether a legal action or enforcement under the Air Pollution Act 1987 is appropriate in the case of backyard burning by a householder since it requires an authorised person to show that a pollutant is present in the resulting emissions and since it requires the authorised person to give 24 hours&rsquo; notice in writing to a householder before visiting their premises; if in view of same he intends to amend waste legislation to provide effective enforcement against backyard burning.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions, including smoke emissions, from such premises. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting an emission in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act provides local authorities with powers to prevent or limit air pollution and penalties include fines and-or imprisonment upon conviction.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>The Waste Management Act 1996 places a general duty of care on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities are empowered to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</P>
        <P>Both the Air Pollution Act and the Waste Management Act require that an authorised person notify, in writing, the occupier of a private dwelling at least 24 hours in advance of their intention to enter their dwelling for the purpose of carrying out their functions. Notification is not necessary when the authorised person has the consent of the occupant. Furthermore, under the Waste Management Act, an authorised person may apply for a warrant to the District Court to authorise entry when it is believed that evidence related to a suspected offence under the Act may be present and is in danger of being removed or destroyed.</P>
        <P>A recent report on the nature and extent of unauthorised waste activity in Ireland, published by the Office of Environmental Enforcement, identifies backyard burning of household waste as a problem area in regard to waste management which requires further action. The report draws attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of over 100 additional waste enforcement officers across the local authorities funded by my Department and the stepped up enforcement by the office of environment enforcement and local authorities. The report identifies additional actions which can further assist in stamping out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice. In light of this report, I am reviewing the effectiveness of existing legislation in dealing with backyard burning of household waste and, if necessary, I will seek to strengthen the powers of local authorities in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 548 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decision in February 2000 to move to electronic voting and counting in Ireland aimed at securing a broad range of identified benefits compared with the current manual arrangements, including more democratic outcomes through the minimisation of invalid votes and the more accurate counting of votes; provision of a higher level of service to the public; greater flexibility and speed in the voting and counting processes and increased use of modern information and communication technologies.</P>
        <P>A programme of further assessment, testing and validation of the electronic voting and counting system is under way to address issues raised by the commission on electronic voting and demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately. The timing of the further use of the system is dependent on the progress made with the above work, the ongoing work of the commission on electronic voting and on the dates on which future polls may be held.</P>
        <P>The total cost incurred to date in the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is &euro;51.088 million, which includes &euro;96,074 paid in 2005 to consultants undertaking a security and risk assessment of the system as part of the above work. In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage cost for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment is some &euro;696,000. It is not possible at this stage to quantify total additional costs that may arise with regard to the electronic voting and counting system. In any event, such costs are likely to be small relative to the capital investment already made.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 550 together.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;3.7 billion will be spent under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 on the provision of water services infrastructure. Substantial increases in water treatment and storage capacity are being achieved as a result of this investment. Schemes completed since 1997 have produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 985,000. The increase in storage capacity over the same period was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of 1.575 million.</P>
        <P>Management of public drinking water supplies is the responsibility of the local authorities which have a range of instruments and measures available to them to conserve sufficient stocks to meet anticipated needs and ensure quality standards. In addition, my Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of watermains.</P>
        <P>Details of approved proposals for further new and upgraded public water supply schemes are set out in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2004-2006, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The schemes included in the programme are mainly derived from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department&rsquo;s request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting additional water supply and treatment requirements.</P>
        <P>Successive Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports on drinking water quality testify to the good quality of public drinking water supplies in Ireland. The most recent EPA report, for 2003, confirms a compliance rate with mandatory drinking water standards for public water supplies of 97.7%. Earlier this year, I announced a record capital allocation of &euro;125 million for the 2005 rural water programme. Water quality problems are now largely confined to group water schemes using private sources such as rivers, lakes and boreholes, many of which are subject to <Col N="189"/>organic pollution. These schemes serve approximately 4% of households nationally and, for the most part, supply water to group members without any prior treatment or disinfection. My Department, in partnership with the county councils and the group scheme sector, is implementing a comprehensive action plan aimed at improving water quality in schemes with private sources. Some &euro;81.35 million has been ring-fenced in 2005 for spending on the provision of water treatment and disinfection facilities on quality deficient schemes and, where feasible, in connecting these schemes to high quality public water supply systems.</P>
        <P>My Department provides 100% capital grants for the construction of essential water treatment and disinfection facilities on schemes with private sources. At present, there are 18 grouped design build operate contracts being progressed for new water treatment plants for 246 individual schemes which, between them, serve 43,786 rural households. Projects are also under way to connect around 70 schemes to the public water supply and county councils propose to take a further 38 poor quality group schemes into public charge. A further 36 schemes which currently supply water in compliance with the required standard will benefit from the provision of new water disinfection and sterilisation equipment. Overall, the necessary resources are being committed to securing a high quality water supply system to remedy deficiencies where they exist and to meet current and future needs.</P>

	<P>The value for money unit of the local government audit service has published 22 reports to date covering the following activities: purchasing &mdash; general; advertising; insurance; parking charges; photocopying; the machinery yard; energy efficiency in local authority buildings; differential rents; property management; public lighting; stores; water production and distribution; housing maintenance; debt collection; waste collection; treasury management; a review of performance indicators; comparative data on local authorities revenue collection; machinery yard &mdash; a guide; internal audit in local authorities; internal audit &mdash; guidance handbook; and motor tax in local authorities.</P>
        <P>These reports contain in excess of 200 recommendations for improving existing procedures, practices and systems. It is a matter for each local authority to adopt the recommendations best suited to their particular local circumstances. As part of its routine regulatory-financial audit, the local government audit service follows up the implementation of these recommendations with local management.</P>
        <P>The audit service is now also undertaking follow-up examinations on some of the areas already subject to review. The first follow-up report on the internal audit function in local authorities is due to be published in December 2005. A feasibility study is being carried out at present for a study on best practice in financial reporting and management information usage and it is also planned to carry out a feasibility study on energy management shortly.</P>

        <P>Income available to local authorities through the local government fund rose from &euro;797 million in 1999 to &euro;1.29 billion in 2005. I am satisfied that the funding I will make available to local authorities, including Donegal County Council, for 2006 through general purpose grants from the fund will make a significant contribution to meeting their increased costs in 2006 and enable them to provide a reasonable level of services while avoiding the need for any undue increases in commercial rates, fees and other charges. Buoyancy in the fund overall since 1999 has ensured that general purpose grants increased by more than double the level of increase in the annual rate on valuation and more than three times the cumulative rate of inflation. I intend to notify local authorities of their general purpose allocations for 2006 shortly.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s consideration of this matter will be informed by the outcome of the statutory housing needs assessment being finalised at present and the work by the housing forum in reviewing the effectiveness of the existing social and affordable housing schemes in the context of the Sustaining Progress agreement.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place a number of new arrangements to facilitate the delivery of strong programmes of social and affordable housing. In consultation with my Department, local authorities have developed five-year action plans for their social and affordable housing programmes covering the period to 2008. The preparation of these plans has improved the identification of priority needs and will help to ensure a more coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services.</P>
        <P>They have also provided an overview of delivery by a range of providers &mdash; local authorities, voluntary and co-operative housing bodies and the private sector, through Part V and public private partnership arrangements.

	<P>I refer to the replies to Question No. 413 of 12 October 2005 and Question No. 637 of 25 October 2005. Statutory protection of the architectural heritage is pri<Col N="196"/>marily a matter for the planning authorities to whom my Department provides advice in the exercise of their functions in that regard under the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>On 25 August 2005, I recommended to Dublin City Council in accordance with section 53 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, that 16 Moore Street should be added to its record of protected structures, RPS, because of its historical and architectural interest. I understand that the city council has received an assessment of the architectural and historic importance of the building and will shortly bring a proposal to the council to add the building to the RPS. I also understand that the city council has recently been able to arrange for the owners to carry out essential repairs to the roof of the premises to ensure the essential fabric of the structure is protected while appropriate decisions are taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not aware of any application for funding under any of the schemes available. As a protected structure on the RPS, the owners of 16 Moore Street would be eligible to apply to Dublin City Council for a grant under the scheme of architectural protection grants which is administered by local authorities and resourced by my Department. The standard amount of grant is 50% of the approved cost of works, up to a maximum of &euro;13,000. A local authority may in exceptional circumstances determine an amount greater than the standard amount up to a maximum of &euro;25,000. Funding for the scheme was increased from &euro;3.9 million in 2004 to &euro;6.85 million in 2005.</P>
        <P>Funding for architectural heritage protection is also provided directly by the Heritage Council under its buildings at risk programme and the council also administers certain once-off grants directly on my behalf. In addition, tax relief is available under 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of an approved building or garden where certain requirements regarding public access are met.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for a scheme of EU co-financed grants for the conservation of the architectural heritage. This scheme provides support for local authorities, civic trusts, and other not for profit bodies to upgrade buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally. This grant scheme is available under the regional operational programme 2000-2006 and is administered by my Department. In accordance with the conditions of the scheme the closing date for the 2006 scheme for the east region was 23 October 2005. Maximum funding available under the scheme is generally some &euro;30,000. All applications for funding under the scheme are assessed by an independent advisory panel.</P>

        <P>At the launch of the interim review, I announced a total of 13 new initiatives designed to provide a renewed momentum to the implementation of the plan for the future. These initiatives include the establishment of a dedicated biodiversity unit in my Department, which also acts as chair of the interdepartmental steering group which oversees implementation of the plan; the establishment of a new biodiversity fund of &euro;1 million, spread over 2006-2007; the establishment of a biodiversity forum as a standing committee of Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership; and the establishment of a biological records centre as an essential mechanism and resource for documentation, monitoring and research in the area of biodiversity.

	<P>The national parks and wildlife service of my Department regularly carries out trapping of mink to protect particular bird colonies. As mink is not a protected species under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000, they can also be trapped freely by landowners and their agents.</P>
        <P>A major scientific study carried out over three years 1983 to 1986 into the biology of the feral mink and its impact and control issues in Ireland concluded that mink populations naturally stabilise. While recommending trapping in specific locations where they are causing a problem, for example, to game birds or to island and colony nesting birds, the study concluded that it is difficult to substantially reduce mink populations over larger areas. It advised that attempting to do so could even exacerbate the problem by creating a vacuum to be filled by young colonisers, which would be liable to cause more problems than a well-established, stabilised population. In most situations the scientific advice is that it is best to leave mink to stabilise naturally.</P>

	<P>The national spatial strategy, NSS, is a 20-year strategic planning framework, published in 2002, aimed at achieving more balanced regional development. Substantial progress has been made at national level in implementing the strategy which is having an increasing influence on policies and programmes across a number of Departments and agencies such as the Department of Finance, Department of Transport, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the development agencies. At regional level, a key policy bridge between national development priorities and local planning has been put in place with the adoption in mid-2004 of regional planning guidelines, RPG&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>At county and city level, strategic land use and planning strategies for the Cork, Waterford and <Col N="199"/>Sligo gateways are in place, while the Limerick and Galway strategies have been prepared and are awaiting adoption. Other strategies for gateways are in preparation and are expected to be put in place over the course of 2006.</P>
        <P>Some practical examples of implementation progress to date include the incorporation of a requirement in capital envelope agreements between Department of Finance and spending Departments that Departments must demonstrate how investments are being prioritised to implement the NSS; the Government&rsquo;s decision in July 2005 that the regional dimension of the next national development plan, which is now in preparation, will be broadly based on the NSS; the recognition of the priorities of the NSS and regional planning guidelines in the ten-year investment plan for transport, Transport 21, recently published by the Government; the &euro;90 million investment in the Mallow-Cork-Midleton commuter rail system now being implemented in accordance with the development framework set out in the Cork area strategic plan and which will support a new 20,000 home development corridor for Cork over the next 15 years; the objectives incorporated in the development plans for Dublin City, Fingal, South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown to promote a substantial increase in housing output in the Dublin metropolitan area and to thus reduce urban sprawl and long distance commuting &mdash; a key objective of the NSS; and in Sligo, a series of private sector hotel, leisure, retail and commercial developments, totalling around &euro;200 million in value, have all commenced since its designation as a gateway.</P>
        <P>Key ongoing and future work in implementing the NSS includes ensuring that the strategy continues to inform the macro-investment agenda. This will continue to require a concerted effort, co-ordinated across Departments and their agencies, regional and local authorities, with a particular focus on driving the accelerated development of the gateways with the support of the necessary investment, particularly in the new NDP period. To support the development of the NSS gateways a major study has been undertaken of their potential for accelerated development in housing, commercial and employment terms and the key infrastructure priorities that will be necessary to facilitate such development. Similar work is also being undertaken in relation to the hubs identified in the NSS. Work on a feasibility study to develop further the concept of an Atlantic gateways corridor, with enhanced linkages and networking between Cork, Galway, Limerick-Shannon and Waterford is also nearing completion. Considerable attention is also being given to the cross-Border aspects of the implementation of the NSS in conjunction with the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland, with particular emphasis on the linked gateway of Derry-Letterkenny and cross-Border <Col N="200"/>elements of the regional planning guidelines for the Border region. Proposals are also being developed to put in place a monitoring framework to report on progress in implementing the NSS, with a special emphasis on up-to-date regional population and housing projections that take account of the latest CSO national population estimates which suggest a national population of up to 5 million by 2020.</P>
        <P>The above processes appropriately apply the national spatial strategy to regional and local requirements and to newly emerging circumstances and opportunities. There are no proposals to make changes to the strategy.</P>

This includes an increase of over 6.5% in the current provision of &euro;839 million. These provisions will contribute to a significantly increased resourcing of the local government sector in 2006.

In this context, the views of the Competition Authority will be given careful consideration. I would hope to be in a position to advance proposals in this regard early in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of legislative measures have been put in place to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to fulfil their responsibilities under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock. These measures are kept under continuous review in my Department.</P>
        <P>The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to behaviour which is acceptable and that which is not. The local authority is empowered under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 is to provide for a range of measures to assist local authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour. The Act gives recognition to the role of local authorities in actively promoting the interests of tenants and other occupiers of the housing and <Col N="202"/>also in working towards the avoidance, prevention and abatement of anti-social behaviour. One of the main provisions of the 1997 Act enables a local authority tenant, or the local authority itself in certain circumstances, to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against an individual member of the household who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. The measures contained in the 1997 Act are essential to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to take effective action in this area.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contains a number of provisions to address the issue of anti-social behaviour in private rented accommodation and also extends the local authority power to obtain excluding orders in respect of the occupants, other than the owner, of tenant purchased houses. It also extends the local authority power to refuse to sell a house to a person it has reason to believe may engage in anti-social behaviour under the tenant purchase scheme to the shared ownership scheme, the affordable housing scheme and affordable houses deriving from Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>In addition to the considerable investments made in regeneration projects under my Department&rsquo;s area regeneration programme, my Department also provides further support to local authorities. The housing unit, which is funded by my Department and local authorities, has produced good practice guidelines on preventing and combating anti-social behaviour. The unit has also organised training courses for local authorities in this regard. In this wider context, my Department has put in place a housing management initiatives scheme which includes funding for programmes to improve estate management, tenant liaison and training initiatives.</P>
        <P>Further issues, including matters of a criminal nature, come within the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>Under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, announced by the Government in July 2004, local authorities will, over a four-year period, progressively assume responsibility for accommodating supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, rent supplement recipients of 18 months or more continuous duration with a long-term housing need.</P>
        <P>The RAS is a collaborative project between my Department, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the community welfare service. All local authorities are due to <Col N="203"/>implement the new arrangements during 2005. Roll-out commenced in an initial group of lead authorities, namely, Dublin, Galway and Limerick city councils, South Dublin, Donegal, Offaly and Westmeath county councils and Drogheda Borough Council. Cork City and County councils and South Tipperary County Council are now implementing the RAS.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 677 of 25 October where I outlined the main actions taken in implementing the scheme. The first transfers to the RAS occurred in the Galway City Council area where 56 households have transferred from the SWA rent supplement scheme. A further 220 households will transfer to the RAS on 1 December in the Dublin city area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Land-based wind energy development is governed by the requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, in making a decision on an application must consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the development plan and the proper planning and sustainable development of the area involved, including the preservation and improvement of amenities. They must also, where relevant, consider the policy, including the energy policy, of the Government or of any Minister of the Government. An Bord Plean&aacute;la accords priority to major infrastructure projects, including large-scale wind energy development.</P>
        <P>Existing guidelines for planning authorities on wind energy development 1996 are being revised by my Department. I intend to publish final revised guidelines to planning authorities on wind energy development shortly, following an extensive consultation on draft revised guidelines published in August 2004.</P>
        <P>The new guidelines will seek to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for wind energy developments. The guidelines will also include a step by step guide to the evaluation of suitable areas for wind energy developments. In addition, visual and landscape aspects of wind farm developments are addressed, including the provision of photomontages of wind farms in various types of landscapes.</P>
        <P>The making of regional planning guidelines is a matter for the relevant regional authority in <Col N="204"/>consultation with the planning authorities within its region. Regional planning guidelines were adopted in all regions by May 2004 and best practice guidance on their implementation was subsequently issued to all regional and local authorities. In accordance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the matters which such guidelines must address for the whole of the region to which they relate include transportation, water services, waste disposal, energy and communications networks.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy addresses at a broad strategic level the issue of the economic and social infrastructure necessary to support the objective of more spatially balanced development. Work is progressing on the planning and development (strategic infrastructure) Bill which will provide for a streamlined development consent procedure for relevant strategic infrastructure projects that are currently subject to the normal planning consent procedure. I intend to publish the Bill in early 2006.</P>

	<P>The exact information as requested by the Deputy is not available. Statistics on employment and unemployment are compiled at a regional level from the quarterly national household survey. The latest statistics show that there were 25,500 people classified as unemployed in the Dublin region in the March-May quarter of 2005. Sub-regional statistics of the kind requested by the Deputy are not available from the quarterly national household survey.</P>
        <P>The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. The most recent information available is for October 2005 and this indicates that there are 3,146 persons on the register in the Tallaght office. It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey; the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office. For instance, in the Tallaght local office there may be registered, persons from the Blessington area.</P>

	<P>The Law Reform Commission, which comes under the aegis of my Department, has a part-time project manager who is a former employee, chief executive officer, Legal Aid Board-assistant secretary, Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform. The project manager assists the Attorney General&rsquo;s consultative committee in monitoring the implementation of the Law Reform Commission recommendations for law review, and relations with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, the Law Reform Commission and the Office of the Attorney General. The project manager was selected by the Office of the Attorney General and then assigned to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission also employs a former employee of the Office of the Attorney General. The commission&rsquo;s annual budget includes a sum of money to engage the services of legal expertise on short-term contracts as the need arises and it is on that basis that the former employee, parliamentary draftsperson, of the office of the Attorney General was engaged to <Col N="206"/>draw up draft Bills including the draft criminal justice (DNA database) Bill 2005, included in the recent report published, The Establishment of a DNA Database, LRC 78-2005.</P>
        <P>During the period in question, the Office of the Attorney General employed several experienced drafters on a contract basis. On average there were 3.5 such persons retained during the past three years, including the former staff member referred to above.</P>
        <P>In June of this year, my Department contracted a temporary clerical officer when there was no clerical officer panel in existence. The recruited individual was afforded development and training opportunities within the Department of the Taoiseach. No former employees have been brought back to work on contract in my Department or in any of the other bodies under its authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of Health and Children, was established to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Authority, NDA, on behalf of the working group, and in line with its own remit, commissioned research into the feasibility of a cost of disability payment in Ireland. The purpose of this research was to advise regarding the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of the disability and the appropriate mechanisms or instruments by which to address identified additional costs. The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was published by the NDA early in 2004.</P>
        <P>The working group in March of this year produced a position paper, which gave an overview of the work they have undertaken to date. It outlined the group&rsquo;s current thinking and also gave an indication of the next steps the working group intend taking.</P>
        <P>The working group recommends that urgent steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland. This might include, for example, adjustment of existing data gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office or other relevant bodies to <Col N="208"/>include questions on the numbers per household with disabilities, the nature of the disability, severity of impairment, etc. The working group considers that it is vital that comprehensive data is available on which to base consideration of the feasibility of a cost of disability payment. Given its advisory and research remit, the working group considers that the National Disability Authority has an important role to play in addressing these data gaps along with other relevant bodies.</P>
        <P>The working group acknowledges that a number of Departments and agencies have previously carried out reviews of the various supports-payments for people with disabilities. However, these reviews have tended to focus solely on the operation of individual schemes without taking a broader overview of how these measures fit into the overall system of disability supports. The working group proposes to examine the scope for rationalising and streamlining the various disability supports measures, with a particular focus on mitigating the additional costs of disability for a greater number of people with disabilities, particularly in the case of those who wish to move from a position of total welfare dependance to one of greater economic independence. The working group is now proceeding to follow up on these various matters including issues related to transport for people with disabilities. The assessment of and entitlement to a mobility allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant area of the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 144, 148, 158 and 203 together.</P>
        <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was established on 2 October 2001 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961. The agency is to work with a wide range of agencies and interests to ensure a co-ordinated approach to address the issue of crisis pregnancy. The agency reports that over the past three years it has enabled the capacity for crisis pregnancy counselling to be increased by more than 50% and this year, the agency will allocate more than &euro;3.5 million towards supports and services within crisis pregnancy.</P>
        <P>The manner in which persons or agencies provide information about pregnancy termination services outside the State is regulated by the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995. This Act permits the provision of abortion information to a pregnant woman only in the context of full counselling as to all available options and without any advocacy of abortion.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency that Positive Options is an information campaign. The agency has indicated that the campaign seeks to empower women to make an informed decision to deal with their crisis pregnancy by informing them, in a neutral way, of the support services available. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has advised me that it has received legal advice that the contents of Positive Options comply with the terms of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995. The work of the agency is monitored by my Department and I have no plans to amend its role or functions.</P>

	<P>Section 4 of the Health Contributions Act 1979 states: &ldquo;There shall be paid, subject to and in accordance with this Act and regulations under this Act, by or in respect of each individual who is over the age of sixteen years, contributions . . . towards the cost of the provision of services under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1978.&rdquo; Further section 7, as amended, provides for the payment of health contributions by individuals with &ldquo;reckonable income . . . in any contribution year&rdquo;.</P><Col N="211"/>
        <P>The definition of &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; for the purposes of the collection of health contributions mirrors that as set down by existing social welfare legislation. As defined in section 6, amended, of the Health Contributions Regulations and further in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, &ldquo;reckonable income means, in relation to an individual, the income aggregate of the individual&rsquo;s income from all sources for the contribution year as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts&rdquo; without regard to various sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This definition does not include any provision for losses.</P>
        <P>Health contributions are, therefore, calculated on all reckonable income in that contribution year and there is no provision for losses carried forward from a previous year to be deducted in this calculation. This approach, which supports the principles underpinning the social insurance system, is the same as that taken in relation to the calculation of liability for PRSI.</P>

	<P>Hospital waste falls into two broad categories, clinical or health care risk waste and non-risk waste. Health care risk waste makes up about 20% of the waste generated in acute hospitals and consists of material or sharp items with the potential to cause injury or infect those who come into contact with the waste. It is classified as hazardous and over 95% of this waste is disposed of by disinfection treatment at Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, licensed plants prior to final disposal. The final disposal is by means of controlled landfilling at a site which is also licensed by the EPA. There are two contractors collecting health care risk waste operating licensed treatment plants, both of which are located in Dublin. The fraction of health care risk waste unsuitable for disposal by disinfection is sent to Belgium or Holland for incineration at suitable licensed hazardous waste facilities.</P>
        <P>The use of radioactive substances and sources, in sealed or unsealed form, together with the accumulation, storage and disposal of radioactive waste in hospitals is controlled by conditions laid down under licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII. The terms of the licences normally require used sealed sources to be returned to the supplier. Unsealed substances are usually short-lived and it is normally permissible to store waste arising until its activity has decayed to a level where it may be safely disposed of as non-radioactive waste.</P>
        <P>Hospital non-risk waste makes up over 80% of the waste generated in acute hospitals and nearly all of the waste in non-acute hospitals. It is largely domestic in nature and is disposed of through the normal municipal or commercial waste disposal route for non-hazardous waste. This is done at numerous EPA licensed facilities by contractors holding waste collection permits issued by the local-regional waste authorities.</P>

	<P>It is accepted that the infrastructure at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children does not generally meet the standards required for a modern paediatric hospital. The available facilities do not satisfactorily accommodate the range and extent of clinical and associated activity. In recognition of this, a project team was established to plan for the overall future development of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, either on the existing hospital site or at an alternative green field location.</P>
        <P>The project team undertook a detailed examination of the potential to redevelop the hospital on its present site. It concluded that the existing clinical services could be retained and developed on the present site but also set out the implications of such an approach in terms of time, cost and disruption to services. As a consequence, it is likely that the new hospital will be located at an alternative site.</P>
        <P>I asked the Health Service Executive to arrange for a review to be undertaken of highly specialised paediatric services to ensure they are <Col N="218"/>provided in the most efficient and effective manner. The outcome of this review will help to inform the decision on the range of services to be provided at the new Crumlin hospital. I expect this review to be completed as a matter of urgency. It is proposed that a site option appraisal study will be carried out when the review has been completed. The focus of the study will be to evaluate the options for the relocation of the hospital, leading to the acquisition of an alternative site, if such is recommended by the process. The study will be subject to public tendering procedures.</P>
        <P>Pending final decisions with regard to the future location of the hospital, three clinical departments were identified as requiring urgent upgrade or expansion. The three departments are haematology and oncology, radiology including MRI, and cardiology. The haematology and oncology project consists of the provision of new accommodation for day and outpatient services. The radiology project will provide new MRI facilities in Crumlin. The cardiology project will provide dedicated inpatient cardiac beds, together with diagnostic, outpatient and administration facilities. Additional revenue funding is required in 2006 to commission the MRI facilities, and I can confirm that this funding is available to the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>I am extremely aware of the negative effects of harmful drinking in Irish society, which include violence, public order offences, drink driving, under-age drinking, unsafe sexual practice, lost productivity, attendance at accident and emergency units, certain cancers and suicide.</P>
        <P>The strategic task force on alcohol was established to recommend evidence based measures to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm and published two reports with more than 100 recommendations. I am hopeful that with the full implementation of these measures we will begin to address the serious problems associated with harmful drinking. I believe a cultural shift in attitudes is required in Ireland to make harmful consumption of alcohol unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A working group on alcohol was recently established to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. The working group operates in the context of the special initiative on alcohol and drug misuse under Sustaining Progress. The working group comprises the social partners, the relevant Departments, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the national <Col N="219"/>drugs strategy team and the Health Service Executive. The working group seeks to agree a programme of actions which can deliver targeted results on underage drinking, binge drinking and drink-driving. It is expected to produce a set of recommendations in late 2005.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the second report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, published in June 2003, contains proposals for the development of psychiatric services for 16 to 18 year olds. It recommends that, in the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services, priority should be given to the recruitment in each Health Service Executive area of a <Col N="221"/>consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence. The report emphasises the importance of co-operation and close liaison between child and adolescent mental health services and suggests that the current arrangements, whereby the adult services provide a service to the population of their catchment area, including the 16 to 18 age cohort, should continue on an interim basis, pending the development of the specialist services referred to earlier.</P>
        <P>The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority for my Department in recent years. Since 1997, additional funding of more than &euro;20 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of a further 23 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally, 56 such psychiatrists are now employed. The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy which is due to complete its work shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to developments in the area of suicide prevention, as the Deputy is aware a new national strategy for action on suicide prevention Reach Out was launched on 8 September 2005. The national office for suicide prevention which was established by the Health Service Executive following the publication of Reach Out will oversee the implementation of the strategy. This office will also co-ordinate suicide prevention activities across the State, will consult widely on the planning of future initiatives and ensure best practice in suicide prevention measures particularly for adolescents and young people.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The recently published Abridged <Col N="223"/>Estimates Volume 2006 provides gross non-capital funding of &euro;11.684 billion to the Health Service Executive for 2006. This compares with a published figure of &euro;10.975 billion for the HSE's Vote in the Revised Estimate 2005. This is a headline increase of &euro;709 million or 6.4%. However, in the Revised Estimates 2005 certain once-off provisions were made due to the establishment of the HSE as a Vote holder, as well as other items which arose in 2005 within the HSE's Vote.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of &euro;122 million was provided in respect of accumulated overdrafts of the former health boards which fell to be repaid at the start of 2005 as the HSE, with its own Vote, is precluded from running an overdraft. A further once-off provision of &euro;94 million was also made available in respect of certain statutory and other deductions from health board employee salaries in December 2004, which were actually paid to Revenue in January 2005, and therefore had to be charged to the HSE's Vote. This had the effect of charging 13 monthly deductions in 2005 rather than the usual 12 monthly deductions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Also included in the list of once-off items is &euro;40 million which was made available under subhead B13 of Vote 40 in respect of the <i>ex gratia </i>payment scheme established in the context of the issue of charges for long-stay care in health board institutions. A once-off sum of &euro;23.8 million was provided in 2005 for arrears to GPs under Partnership 2000. These once-off items total &euro;280 million. Therefore, the 2005 REV figure comparable with that published in AEV 2006 excludes these items and amounts to &euro;10.695 million. Comparing this with the HSE's gross non-capital funding for 2006 shows an underlying increase of 9.25%.</P>

	<P>Disposal of blood and other clinical-healthcare waste materials in hospitals is expected to be carried out in accordance with guidelines entitled Segregation, Packaging and Storage Guidelines for Healthcare Risk Waste, the most recent edition of which was published by my Department&rsquo;s hospital planning office in April 2004. General practitioners must make arrangements to have healthcare risk waste disposed of in accordance with environmental and health and safety regulations.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, does not currently accept blood donations from people with haemochromatosis. Blood donors must donate on a voluntary basis and a significant reason why donations are not taken from people with haemochromatosis is that blood is taken from them as part of the treatment for their condition rather than for the specific purpose of donating. The IBTS is working with the Irish Haemochromatosis Association to identify practicable solutions that would address the concerns of people with haemochromatosis in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the Irish Haemochromatosis Association that a proposal for a screening programme was developed by St James&rsquo;s Hospital in conjunction with the IBTS, but was not successful in obtaining research funding from the Health Research Board in 2005. I am unsure whether another application will be made for funding in 2006.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a <Col N="240"/>letter issued to the taxpayer on 22 November 2005, outlining the various methods by which he may make application for tax relief for service charges and attaching a copy of the information available on the website. Claims for claiming back credits in respect of service changes may be lodged through any one of the following channels: by contacting any of the four regional lo-call telephone numbers, details in table 1; by accessing the Revenue website where, on the home page, a person is invited to use electronic services to claim for domestic refuse charges; by using the PAYE self-service mobile telephone text messaging facility, details of this facility are again available on the home page of their website; or by calling into one of the nationwide network of revenue information offices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to Dublin, the Revenue Commissioners also have a number of regional offices throughout the country in Galway, Castlebar, Sligo, Letterkenny, Athlone, Dundalk, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Thurles, Cork, Limerick and Tralee. Specific details on tax relief for service charges are contained in form IT 27, which is available on their website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i> and gives an overview of: the service charges which qualify for tax relief; the individuals who <Col N="241"/>qualify for tax relief; the conditions applicable for tax relief; and the amount of the tax relief. In addition, the leaflet outlines the application procedure for claiming tax relief, depending on the method of payment of the service charges.</P>

	<P>The position is that, as a general rule, the tax credits available to parents are not related to family size. Accordingly, a claimant who qualifies for the one-parent family tax credit, which is in addition to the basic personal tax credit, is entitled to only one such credit for any year of assessment irrespective of the number of qualifying children resident with her or him in that year.</P>
        <P>However, any parent, including a single parent, who has an incapacitated child, or children, is entitled, in addition to the basic personal tax credit and the one-parent family tax credit, if appropriate, to an incapacitated child tax credit in respect of each incapacitated child.</P>

	<P>The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to it closed on 30 April 2002. The accounts are due to mature between May 2006 and April 2007 at the end of the five year period. A total of 1.17 million accounts were opened during the period outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The specific goal of the SSIA scheme was to encourage people to save over a period of at least five years. Its effect has been to stimulate such savings over varying income ranges which is evident in the extensive take-up by many low income earners. The scheme has been a success in those terms. The scheme has a specific duration.</P><Col N="242"/>
        <P Just="Left">As regards re-investment advice, I refer the Deputy to yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the financial regulator. The consumer director of the financial regulator will be producing information in the new year that will help people to make informed decisions about what to do with their SSIA money. In the meantime, the regulator&rsquo;s savings and investments guide, which outlines the different types of savings and investment options available may be obtained by phoning the consumer help-line on lo-call 1890 77 77 77, by visiting <i>www.itsyourmoney.ie</i> or by calling into the consumer information centre at 6-8 College Green, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not the practice to comment in the lead up to the annual budget and Finance Bill on the intention or otherwise to make changes in taxation.</P>

By order made on 9 February 2004 the High Court adjourned the matter generally with liberty to re-enter on notice to enable various persons to be notified of the claim. The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office has informed me that proceedings will shortly be re-entered in the High Court. Another party disputes our entitlement to part of the lands adverse to that of the Minister for Finance and she will be put on notice of our application.

        <Quest>the framework for greenhouse gas taxation; if same has been put in place since 2002; the greenhouse gas taxes which have been introduced or which are contemplated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36731/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The climate change strategy says that from 2002 onwards taxes will begin to take into account the amounts of greenhouse gases produced in any activity. It is indeed Government policy to take greenhouse gas emission into account when formulating or developing tax policy in any particular area.</P>
        <P>In September 2004, the Government decided not to introduce a specific carbon tax, following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including how a carbon tax would be implemented and the associated environmental, economic and social impacts. In addition, my Department carried out an extensive consultation process in which 117 written submissions were received. Following this examination, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the other measures under the national climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>The Government concluded that the environmental benefits of a carbon tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax. In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases, particularly as a result of recent increases in international oil prices. While a carbon tax would have involved a range of compensatory measures, these would not fully address the adverse economic and social effects arising. Moreover a carbon tax would apply to products which are in the main already subject to excise duties and where a new tax is not specifically necessary to increase tax rates.</P>
        <P>The carbon energy tax was just one possible element of the Government&rsquo;s approach to meet<Col N="244"/>ing Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to which the Government remains fully committed. Taxation can play a part in attaining environment objectives. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that in developing policy on tax measures we take into account any effects on Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness, particularly concerning non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from the carbon tax, the national climate change strategy envisages other initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for green initiatives. Essentially, this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour. Such examples include capital allowances for corporate investment in renewable energy projects which have been available since 1998, and a provision for the current pilot scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, I cannot comment on any plans in this area which may be the subject of a budget provision.</P>

	<P>An exemption from capital gains tax on the disposal of, or an interest in, an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence has been in place since the introduction of capital gains tax in 1975. The exemption applies to all individuals, including those who have been cohabiting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general a gain on the disposal by an individual of, or an interest in, his or her principal private residence is exempt from capital gains tax if the property has been occupied as his or her only or main residence throughout his or her period of ownership. The last 12 months of ownership is, in any event, regarded as a period of occupation. Where the dwelling house was not so occupied throughout the period of ownership, a proportion of the gain on the disposal is exempt. Where a principal private residence is jointly owned each owner must separately satisfy the conditions for the relief.</P>
        <P>Where a cohabiting couple dispose of the family home but do not qualify for the full principal private residence relief as already outlined, they would be liable to capital gains tax on the part of the gain which is not exempt, the same as any other individual.</P>

        <P>As the taxpayer is the assessable spouse, she is entitled to the basic personal tax credit for a married person for the year of separation, &euro;3,160 in 2005, and is assessable on her spouse&rsquo;s income until the date of separation.

        <Quest>the projects which have been subjected to detailed cost benefit appraisal in the past six months; the benefit cost ratio which emerged from this test; if he has satisfied himself that projects being selected not only pass this test but represent a better return than competing uses for the same limited funds; and the way in which this process influences the size of the capital envelope for different project areas.</Quest>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to major capital projects which must be the subject of a detailed cost benefit analysis in accordance with the guidelines for appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector. As the Deputy will appreciate, given its functions, my Department is not engaged in major capital projects. Its capital expenditure in 2004 was &euro;13.286 million and its capital allocation in 2005 is &euro;11.108 million, and in both years most of the moneys were allocated for use by other bodies. Accordingly, no capital proposal put forward by my Department was the subject of a detailed cost benefit appraisal in the past six months.</P>
        <P>I should add that although the Office of Public Works is not funded directly or indirectly by my Department, in view of the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my Department has asked that office to communicate to the Deputy any relevant information concerning it.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s capital allocation in 2005 is &euro;11.108 million and most of the moneys allocated are for use by other bodies. My Department is not engaged in managing major capital projects and the issue of reviewing contracts in excess of &euro;30 million does not therefore arise.</P>
        <P>I should add that although the Office of Public Works is not funded directly or indirectly by my Department&rsquo;s Vote, in view of the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my Department has asked that office to communicate to the Deputy any relevant information concerning it.</P>
        <P>In my address of 20 October last to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce I set out a number of measures to promote better value for money including a requirement that for large projects over &euro;30 million there will be a formalised contracts review by the Departments concerned with reports to their Minister and with provision for audit by my Department. This provision is focused on the internal management by Departments of capital projects. I wrote to all Ministers on 20 October asking them to ensure that their Departments take immediate steps, as appropriate, to implement the measures in my address in areas under their remit. Follow-up work is under way in my Department on updating exist<Col N="250"/>ing guidelines and other necessary steps to ensure that all the measures are implemented in full. Consideration is being given in this context to the arrangements to be put in place in my Department regarding the provision for audit of contracts for major projects in excess of &euro;30 million.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Based on information supplied by Departments, I am setting out as follows details of 54 expenditure reviews completed or under way in 2005 under the existing round of expenditure reviews. The indicative estimate of the expenditure covered by the reviews is over &euro;3.8 billion. Some 12 of the reviews have been completed, 14 have been quality assessed and are close to completion, seven are at quality assessment stage, and 21 are ongoing. Any reviews not completed by the end of the year will be required to be completed as part of the 2006-08 round of expenditure reviews which I will be submitting to Government shortly for approval.</P><Col N="249"/>

        <P FLI="0">The Government approved the topics for review for the first year and the indicative list of topics for the second and third years of the existing round of expenditure reviews and the overall arrangements for carrying out reviews. In general, review topics were to focus on major policy issues or significant levels of expenditure. The expenditure review process is overseen by the expenditure review central steering committee. The committee is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and its secretariat is also provided by my Department. Responsibility for the conduct of the reviews rests with individual Departments and offices. Any questions regarding individual expenditure reviews should therefore be directed to the relevant Departments or offices.</P>

        <Quest>the terms of the Revenue Commissioners ruling on the application of VAT to the collection and disposal of waste; the annual revenue collected <Col N="254"/>in VAT on these activities and the extra revenue anticipated in view of this ruling; and the impact it will have on privatised collection and disposal services compared with those operated by local authorities.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36952/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that earlier this year they became aware that VAT was being applied inconsistently in the private waste management sector. Indeed, compliant members of the trade wanted the Revenue Commissioners to ensure consistency of treatment across the industry. There was a lack of clarity on the part of some private operators about the application of VAT to waste disposal. The legal position regarding the VAT treatment is clear. In the case of privately operated landfill facilities, VAT is chargeable at 13.5% on the total consideration that the operator is entitled to receive, inclusive of the landfill levy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June 2005, the Revenue Commissioners issued instructions to their staff confirming the legal position on the application of VAT in the private waste management sector and the necessity for consistency of treatment across the sector. The commissioners subsequently published an article in their tax briefing publication, which explained the correct VAT treatment. Revenue officials also recently met representatives from the Irish Waste Management Association to confirm the correct VAT treatment.</P>
        <P>In so far as the application of VAT to local authorities engaged in the collection and disposal of waste is concerned, the legal position is that such authorities are exempt from VAT. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide, nor can they claim VAT back on any of the inputs that go towards providing a service. Essentially, only VAT registered <Col N="255"/>businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>Finally, regarding the annual yield from VAT in the area of private sector waste management, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be provided. Waste collection and disposal services are classified within the same economic sector as a wide range of other services and can not be separately identified.</P>
        <P>There is nothing I can do in this matter as EU rules dictate how VAT should be levied.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he intends to take to increase the provision of renewable energy following the report from the Commission for Energy Regulation in 2005 which estimates that the cost of electricity is set to rise significantly due to higher fuel costs and rising carbon emission costs.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have announced publicly a new support programme to increase the consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources from approximately 5% currently to 13.2% by 2010. This target to more than double output in a five-year period will require developers to more than double the 675 MW currently available to 1,450 MW by the 2010 deadline.</P>
        <P>The new support mechanism moves from competitive tendering to a fixed price scheme, in order to ensure this target is delivered. This means that any applicant who meets the published criteria, after the new programme is formally launched, may submit an application for support at a predetermined fixed price.</P>
        <P>The new programme, the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, REFIT, will better ensure that we can more than double the amount of renewable energy powered electricity plant connected to the electricity network thereby doubling output within a five-year period.</P>
        <P>The question of what further targets can be set and in what timeframe is one that requires further analysis and technical input, largely but not exclusively, on grid access and associated technical issues to ensure the continuity of electricity supply to all customers at the most reasonable cost possible.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>New fishing effort limitations for, <i>inter alia</i>, crab, edible crab and spider crab, were established under EU Regulation No. 1415/2004 of 19 July 2004. Separate limits, expressed in kilowatt days, were established for Ireland for International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, areas V and VI, which includes the waters off the north-west coast of Ireland, and for ICES area VII, which covers the rest of the waters off the Irish coast including the west coast. Within the area VII allocation there was also a sub-allocation for the biologically sensitive area, BSA, or new Irish Box.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there are no catch quotas for these fisheries, the effort limitations require that the fisheries be managed at national level and closed where effort limitations are reached. The closure on the west and north-west coasts referred to by the Deputy is implemented by the Crab (Fisheries Management and Conservation) Regulations 2005, SI 676 of 2005, in respect of areas V and VI, which came into operation on 2 November 2005, and the Crab (Fisheries Management and Conservation) (No.2) Regulations 2005, SI 705 of 2005, in respect of area VII, which came into operation on 11 November. These regulations applied to Irish sea-fishing boats over 15 m in length, with the exception of the area within the BSA where they applied to Irish sea-fishing boats over ten metres in length. However, the area VII fishery, with the exception of the BSA, has now been reopened for the period from 25 November to 9 December, and the area VI fishery has been reopened from today until 12 December after I secured additional fishing effort for this fishery. In the event of the effort not used and-or I secure further effort, I shall reopen after 9 December in respect of area VII and the 12 December in respect of area VI.</P>
        <P>I am also pursuing a scientific case at EU level to increase the EU effort allocation for the fishery off the north-west coast, in order to bring long-term stability to this important fishery.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am advised that the Marine Institute in conjunction with the regional fisheries boards, fishery owners, engineers from this Department and consultants-contractors has installed some 22 fish counting systems on the following Irish salmon and sea trout rivers: Dee, Boyne, Liffey, Slaney, Suir, Bandon, Kerry Blackwater, Laune, Waterville, Feale, Casla, Gowla, Invermore, Erriff, Moy, Ballysadare, Garravogue, Eany, Eske and Dungloe. Furthermore, I understand that the ESB has also installed fish counting systems on a number of rivers under its jurisdiction. There are also a number of fish counters on privately owned fisheries.</P>
        <P>It has not been possible within the time available to extract from all of these agencies the precise information being sought by the Deputy. I have asked the agencies concerned to provide me with this information as soon as possible and I will forward the details to the Deputy as soon as I have received and collated it.</P>
        <P>Since taking up office as Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have emphasised that I expect the regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute to collaborate in managing the fish counter programme in the most effective and efficient way possible. In order to achieve this, the Department is currently reviewing the current arrangements in respect of the operational, data management and quality assurance issues for the national fish counter management programme.</P>
        <P>I expect this review to be completed shortly so that an enhanced national management programme will be established within the available resources and will be carried out by the regional fisheries boards in partnership with the Marine Institute in 2006 and future years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>On 6 October 2005 the European Commission published its proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel to previous <Col N="258"/>levels. I am advised that this proposed regulation has been drawn up following the work of a technical advisory group of experts, which included appropriate Irish representation.</P>
        <P>The principal element of the proposed regulation is the establishment of national eel management plans by each member state. The key objective of each national plan would be to allow a minimum of 40% escapement of adult eel from rivers to the sea to allow for spawning. The national plan would set out the mechanisms by which this objective would be achieved and also the methods to be employed to monitor the implementation of the plan. The EU Commission propose that national plans would be submitted to the Commission by the end of 2006 and subject to approval by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, would be operational by 1 July 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition to these national plans the Commission also proposes that there would be a prohibition on fishing for eel for the first 15 days of each month. Once national plans are established and implemented this prohibition could be lifted subject to all the conditions set out in the plan being met.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Commission proposals on establishing recovery measures for the conservation of glass and silver eels. While I also accept the scientific assessment of the status of the stock, there is some evidence to suggest that stocks in Ireland have not, to date, deteriorated as dramatically as elsewhere in Europe. Nevertheless, a full recovery of the eel stock will have benefits for both the international community and for the Irish fishery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of issues remain unclear in the draft regulation that has caused much discussion between member states&rsquo; scientists and on which clarification will be required. I am advised that the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposed regulation will be discussed at working group level and Council level over the next six months. Officials from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, including appropriate technical experts from the relevant State agencies under its aegis, will be involved closely in these discussions in order to clarify the implications of the proposed regulation from an Irish perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, the Department will work with relevant state agencies and stakeholders in Ireland to develop a national eel management plan. This plan, including the incorporation of the eel in the Common Fisheries Policy and the data collection regulation, will impact on traditional eel fisheries, pose challenges for fisheries&rsquo; management and scientific structures and for other users of water resources. The aim will be to have this plan ready for submission to the EU within the deadlines ultimately specified in the proposed regulation when ratified by the EU Parliament.</P>

	<P>Ten staff members from within the units of my Department decentralising to Clonakilty have formally accepted transfer offers to that location. Five members of staff in areas of the Department relocating to Drogheda have formally accepted offers to transfer there. A total of 18 staff members currently within areas in the Department due to decentralise to Cavan have formally committed to move to that location. A further 16 staff members within these areas have made a first preference priority application to decentralise to Cavan under the central applications facility and have yet to receive formal offers of transfer for decision. In addition to the above, eight other Dublin-based Department staff have formally committed to relocate to one of the three decentralised locations.</P>
        <P>Three staff members who wish to relocate to Clonakilty have been re-assigned to units within the Department for the purpose of decentralising to that location. One staff member who has opted to decentralise to Drogheda has been re-assigned to a unit of the Department that is relocating there. One other member of staff who has opted to decentralise to Cavan has been re-assigned to a Department unit that is due to relocate there. The re-assignment of these five staff took place in recent months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sixteen staff members who have not opted to decentralise with their Department units have been re-assigned to other areas within the Department, to date, in 2005. These re-assignments did not arise from decentralisation but as part of mobility policy. The areas of the Department to which these staff have been re-assigned are also due to relocate, as all of the Department is due to decentralise to Cavan. In 2005 to date, 15 former staff members who did not opt to decentralise with my Department have transferred to other Departments or offices. Only three of these transfers were, however, due to decentralisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most recent data from the central applications facility indicate that there are 36 applications for the 39 posts in Sustainable Energy <Col N="262"/>Ireland, SEI, which is decentralising to Dundalk. Some 24 staff, or 62% of the work force, have expressed an interest in moving with the organisation. In the case of the Central Fisheries Board, CFB, 31 expressions of interest have been received for the 62 posts decentralising to Carrick-on-Shannon, of which three are internal to the CFB.</P>

However, internal staff surveys suggest interest in relocating with the agency of up to 26 staff. Central developments will have a bearing on trends and developments at agency level over the coming months.</P>

	<P>Louth County Council owns Port Oriel harbour at Clogherhead and is responsible for the development of the harbour. The original proposal for the development of Port Oriel was based on a &euro;6.5 million total cost project. This was subsequently increased to &euro;8.55 million, of which the Department is providing 75% grant aid towards the total cost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recently visited the site at Clogherhead and discussed the development project with local interests. The current project provides for a 75 m extension to the pier and this work is advancing. Louth County Council has requested its consultants to examine the possibility of providing a<?oasys _jy?>105 m extension at the harbour and to give an estimate of the costs involved. I await an update from the council of this examination. The decision on such a further extension of the pier is a matter for Louth County Council and in considering that option, the council will have to consider the additional cost burden, revisit the cost-benefit analysis and recalculate the internal rate of return for the project. In the event that a decision is made to proceed with a further extension of the pier, it will be a matter for the council to apply to this Department for additional funding. The Department would consider such an application, having regard to the amount of fund<Col N="263"/>ing available for fishery harbour development and overall national priorities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In June 1998, the Council of Fisheries Ministers took a decision to ban drift netting for tuna with effect from 1 January 2002, a decision which was provided for in EU law by Council Regulation 1239/1998.</P>
        <P>In this regulation, the introduction of the ban on drift netting for albacore tuna was postponed until 2002. As part of the transition process to new methods of fishing this valuable species, Bord Iascaigh Mhara provided substantial EU-assisted support to interested fishermen to develop alternative fishing techniques. A variety of fishing gears and techniques was tested and the results of trials undertaken have shown that it is possible to catch tuna with non-drift netting techniques and, in these circumstances, the question of compensation does not arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish fishing boats have been successfully fishing for tuna since 2002, mainly by means of mid- water trawl but also with trolling. BIM continues to work on improving our understanding of this species and during 2005 undertook trials in conjunction with a Spanish research institute, AZTI, and the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation in order to improve our understanding of the migratory and daily patterns of movement of this species.</P>
        <P>The aid package agreed in 1998 was specifically designed to facilitate the development of alternative fishing techniques to drift netting. There is no question of money allocated by the EU for the compensation of tuna fishermen being spent for other purposes.</P>

	<P>The term non-governmental organisation is commonly applied to not-<Col N="265"/>for-profit organisations which have a charitable or humanitarian focus. As far as my Department is concerned, the non-governmental organisations it has contact with are typically involved in a variety of charitable activities, fund raising and development work targeted at the Third World. They range in size from small once-off initiatives to large organisations such as Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire. Although they may have a volunteer base of membership they also have, in many cases, a professional staff to administer their operations.</P>
        <P>In order to be eligible for funding from the Department, an organisation must normally be registered in Ireland as a tax-exempt charitable organisation. The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the administration of charitable tax exemption under taxation legislation. They currently issue a charity reference number, for example, CHY 123, to bodies which are granted charitable tax exemption by them. They maintain and publish, including on their website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i> a list of those bodies.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is currently preparing new legislation covering the charitable sector. This legislation will introduce an integrated system of mandatory registration, proportionate regulation and supervision. The proposed independent regulatory body, to be positioned as the centrepiece of the regulatory regime, will be responsible for setting up and maintaining a register of charities.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, in addition to requiring charitable status, also requires that any organisation which it funds has in place an acceptable structure of corporate governance and demonstrates that it has the staff and capacity to implement effectively the projects or programmes for which funding is sought.</P>
        <P>In general, the Department funds the work of organisations which have as their focus the improvement of the lives of the most vulnerable sectors of the population, including children, in the developing world. Through innovative mechanisms, such as the multi-annual programme scheme, MAPS, it has implemented international best practice regarding the effective disbursement of development aid to NGOs. A strong emphasis on the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the systems, practices and performance of the NGOs funded has also helped ensure that the quality of Irish aid to the developing world remains at the forefront of the international development effort. In this context, Development Co-operation Ireland does not specify any particular additional requirements for the funding of organisations with a remit to support children in the developing world.</P>

        <P>The main consular services provided by our embassies and consulates abroad are as follows: issuing emergency passports, assisting victims of serious accidents, illnesses or crime, assisting people detained, arrested or imprisoned abroad, transferring funds to Irish citizens abroad where conventional means are unreliable or non-existent, repatriating Irish citizens in emergency circumstances and providing assistance in connection with deaths abroad and the return of remains to Ireland.</P>
        <P>If a death of an Irish citizen occurs abroad, the Department, as stated above, will offer all possible assistance and support including, where necessary, with autopsies, death certificates, liaising with undertakers and airlines, and so forth. In the great majority of cases, the cost of repatriation would be covered by the family in question. When necessary, the Department is happy to provide financial assistance locally, on a cost recoverable basis. In addition, in exceptional circumstances, including natural disasters, the repatriation of remains has been undertaken at State expense.</P>
        <P>The Department strongly advises intending travellers abroad to take out adequate travel insurance prior to travel. This advice is available on our website at <i>www.dfa.ie.</i></P>

	<P>The Irish Embassy in Madrid was informed on 9 August 2005 of the tragic death of a person in Ibiza and subsequently assisted the family with the repatriation of the remains. Officials from the embassy liaised directly with the police investigating the death, as well as the pathologist, the undertakers, the court and the doctors who had treated the deceased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The autopsy report has been obtained, translated and sent to the family. Medical samples from the body were retained and sent to the National Toxicological Institute in Barcelona, so <Col N="267"/>that an accurate assessment of the cause of death could be made. It is standard procedure in Spain to remove samples where the autopsy concludes that further investigation is needed. A translation of the resulting toxicological report has already been sent to the family. The Irish Embassy in Madrid will be very happy to liaise with the institute on the family&rsquo;s behalf to obtain the return of these samples. The family has been advised to this effect and also, in accordance with Spanish requirements, to forward a written authorisation to the Department of Foreign Affairs to enable the request to be pursued.</P>
        <P>A separate investigation into the premises where the person died is ongoing and our honorary consul in Mallorca is monitoring this investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On behalf of the family of the deceased, the embassy in Madrid also obtained the relevant police report and hospital medical file. These documents have now been translated and forwarded to the family.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Embassy will be very happy to continue to assist the family, to whom our deepest sympathy goes, in every way possible.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, announced in December 2003, the development co-operation directorate, DCD, of the Department of Foreign Affairs, currently based in Dublin, is scheduled to decentralise to Limerick. This will involve the relocation of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007.</P>
        <P>Already, a total of 28 posts in the directorate, including that of director general, are filled by officers who have applied to decentralise to Limerick. Of these, 13 officers were already serving within the directorate and three were serving elsewhere in the Department. A total of eight officers were recruited from other Departments via the central applications facility and four were assigned from inter-departmental promotion panels. There are a further 17 officers serving elsewhere in the Department, one based in Dublin and the remainder abroad, who have also expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick. To date, three officers from DCD, who did not wish to decentralise to Limerick, have <Col N="269"/>been transferred to other divisions of the Department.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>The process of transferring to the directorate the officers currently serving elsewhere in the Department and of recruiting further staff for Limerick via the central applications facility will be accelerated in the new year.

	<P>I met the Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Hain, in Dublin on 19 October when we jointly chaired a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. At that meeting, the Secretary of State and I underlined our determination to work with the political parties to continue to restore trust and confidence and to rebuild political momentum in the peace process. In that context, we indicated we would make ourselves jointly available for a series of stocktaking meetings with the political parties. As part of this exercise, I met the Secretary of State on 14 November at Hillsborough where we had a series of meetings with Sinn F&eacute;in, the PUP and the UKUP. We met again at Hillsborough on 24 November for a second round of meetings with the SDLP, the UUP and the Alliance Party. These meetings complemented the bilateral meetings which both Governments have had with political parties in recent weeks, including the Government&rsquo;s meeting with the DUP in Dublin on 18 November.</P>
        <P>My meetings with the Secretary of State on 14 and 24 November were a useful opportunity for a comprehensive exchange of views on current issues in the peace process and on how we could best make progress in the coming months. Our discussions with the parties were constructive and covered a broad range of issues including the prospects for restoration of devolved institutions. Our primary purpose was to listen to the views of the parties and to take stock of the issues which need to be addressed in order to advance the process in the period ahead. Both the Secretary of State and I confirmed our determination to build confidence, to maintain political momentum and to make progress on behalf of all communities in Northern Ireland. We were very much encouraged that all of the parties indicated to us that they too wished to see confidence in politics restored so that those elected to represent their communities could deliver for them.</P>
        <P>In addition to discussions on the political way forward at our meeting in Hillsborough on 24 November, the Secretary of State and I also discussed the importance of the two Governments working together to foster economic growth in <Col N="270"/>the north west region. We agreed that we would take forward this work by asking relevant sectoral Ministers, North and South, to meet and explore ways in which we can cooperate more closely to maximise the potential of the north west.</P>
        <P>In light of our recent meetings with the parties, I expect to have a further meeting with the Secretary of State in December to consider the best way of taking work forward in the new year. The next meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is scheduled to take place in early 2006. Both Governments will also continue to maintain ongoing contact with the political parties.</P>

        <P>The company in question has issued notice of temporary lay-off to 19 temporary employees in order to reduce costs until trading conditions improve. The company has informed the agency that it is awaiting word over the next few weeks on a number of potential contracts which, should the company win them, would require the reinstatement of the employees currently on protective notice.</P>
        <P>In a genuine lay-off situation, an employee can terminate his or her employment for redundancy after four weeks on lay-off if the employer, within a further four week period, is not in a position to offer him or her 13 weeks unbroken service in the employment. In such a case, the employee would be entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment, based on age, length of service in the employment and at the gross weekly wage, subject to a ceiling on wages of &euro;600 per week. No claims have been received this year from the company in respect of statutory redundancy.</P>
        <P>The company in question has received &euro;696,123 in grant assistance from IDA Ireland since 1970. IDA Ireland is not aware of any plans by the company to relocate to another jurisdiction. In the event of a decision to relocate, IDA Ireland <Col N="274"/>would take all appropriate action to recover outstanding liabilities. This company has not received any grant assistance from Enterprise Ireland. However, another company currently owned by the company in question received grant aid amounting to &euro;170,870 from Enterprise Ireland, for which there are liabilities outstanding. I understand that an agreement has recently been reached regarding payment of the outstanding liabilities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Current policy is that generally new work permits are issued only in respect of highly skilled and-or highly paid positions. I am aware that within the European Economic Area there are communities from the main ethnic groups who are active in the restaurant and catering sector and, as a result, suitable employees are available to fill these positions. However, a limited number of work permit applications for fully-trained chefs for ethnic restaurants are considered. These applications are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>I indicated in my address on the Second Stage of the Employment Permits Bill 2005, on 12 October, that new arrangements would be introduced in order to implement an active managed economic migration policy. These comprise a green card for occupations where there are skills shortages, which will be available for a restricted list of occupations in the annual salary range from &euro;30,000 to &euro;60,000 and for a more extensive list of occupations in the annual salary range above &euro;60,000; other sectors work permits will only be granted where it can be demonstrated, following a rigorous labour market test, that suitable employees are not available within the EEA; and a re-established intra-company transfer scheme for temporary transnational management transfers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The current Department of Finance Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure requires that a cost benefit analysis should be carried out in respect of projects with a value of over &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>My Department was not directly involved in carrying out capital projects of this magnitude within the last six months.</P>
        <P>Within my Department&rsquo;s agencies, an IDA Ireland project was approved within the last six months where the value of grants exceeded &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>This project related to the establishment of the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training. The decision to make the investment in the NIBRT was made following wide consultation with industry and academia in Ireland as well as in the US and Europe, led by IDA Ireland, which determined that there was a strategic competitive need for Ireland to establish a state-of-the-art, industry-focused centre in biomanufacturing and bioprocessing technology education, training and research if Ireland was to continue to compete for international large scale biopharmaceutical investments.</P>
        <P>Given the specific nature and characteristics of this project, it was considered more appropriate to evaluate the investment using an international review panel model rather than carrying out a more general cost benefit analysis. This process involved appointing a panel of international experts to ensure that the project was assessed by people with the appropriate knowledge and expertise. A process auditor was also appointed to oversee the process.</P>
        <P>An open call for proposals to establish the NIBRT was held in July 2004 and three proposals were received. The international review panel carried out a very extensive evaluation of the proposals before making its recommendation to IDA Ireland. A UCD-led consortium was selected, based on the international review panel&rsquo;s report.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>The board of IDA Ireland was satisfied that there was a clear need for this investment and that clear benefits would accrue to the State in the form of further substantive investment by the biotechnology industry in Ireland, the development of appropriate skills for the biotechnology industry and the development of research in biotechnology techniques and methodologies.</P>
        <P>The board approved grants totalling &euro;72 million to this project in May 2005 and Government approval for this project was received at the end of August 2005. The grants will be paid over a period of years on the achievement of specified milestones and with ongoing and annual reviews being carried out by IDA Ireland, with the assistance of appropriate experts. The funding will be paid from IDA Ireland&rsquo;s allocation in my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently announced a number of initiatives to deliver better value for money in both current and capital expenditure. These include a provision that, in future, a full scale cost benefit appraisal will take place on all projects with a value of over &euro;30 million. My Department will be putting the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that this initiative is implemented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for payments made towards future pension provision to be exempted from liability for PRSI contributions for self-employed contributors who are outside the PAYE system. To narrow the base for social insurance by introducing such a provision would give rise to a significant loss of contribution income for the social insurance fund, while still maintaining responsibility for the cost of benefits and pensions for which the self-employed are eligible.</P>
        <P>Self-employed contributors are liable for contributions at 3% of reckonable income and in order to maintain the capacity of the social insurance fund to meet its commitments, the question of a rise in contribution rates for self-employed contributors would have to be addressed. Exempting contributions payable towards private pension provision without an increase in rates would diminish the contributory principle that underpins the social insurance system. There are no plans to alter current rules.</P>

The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 sets out the income liable to social insurance contributions from self-employed contributors. The basis of assessment or reckonable income of a self-employed is defined as meaning the aggregate income, excluding reckonable earnings, reckonable emoluments and any other income that may be prescribed, from all sources for the contribution year as estimated in accordance with the Income Tax Acts, but without regard to artists exemptions, profits from stallions, woodlands and other issues relating to the taxation of married couples.</P>
        <P>The definition provides that some elements of income, which would normally be exempted from income tax, such as artist&rsquo;s exemptions, profits from woodlands and stallions, are not similarly exempt from liability for social insurance contributions.</P>
        <P>Equally, it provides that aggregate income is the basis of assessment used for the purposes of assessing liability to social insurance purposes and not the total income basis used for the calculation of income tax liability. While total income provides for loss relief, the definition of aggregate income does not.</P>
        <P>As such, social insurance is calculated on all reckonable income in that year and does not provide for the deduction of losses carried forward from a previous year in the calculation of liability for PRSI. The approach supports the solidarity and contributory principles that underpin the social insurance system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 268, 269 and 273 together.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P>
        <P>From January this year the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for a carer under 66 years increased from &euro;139.60 to &euro;153.60 per week, while the maximum rate for a carer over 66 years increased from &euro;157.80 to &euro;169.80 per week.</P>
        <P>In addition, all recipients of the carer&rsquo;s allowance receive the household benefits package of free schemes and the annual respite care grant. A person caring for two or more people also receives an additional 50% on his or her personal payment.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person.</P>
        <P>I made provision in 2005 for major improvements to the respite care grant. This included the extension of the grant of &euro;1,000 to all persons providing full-time care and attention, regardless of their means. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, will be entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full-time care condition.</P>
        <P>This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers, especially with regard to respite and it is estimated that more than 31,000 carers will receive a respite care grant in 2005.</P>
        <P>With regard to the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance, the weekly income disregards have been <Col N="282"/>increased to &euro;270 for a single person and to &euro;540 for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn up to &euro;30,700 and receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, while the same couple can earn up to &euro;49,200 and receive the minimum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>The complete abolition of the means test would have substantial cost implications, estimated at &euro;140 million in a full year. Any further improvements to the carer&rsquo;s allowance will be considered in the context of the budget and overall social welfare policy reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to figures collected under the quarterly national household survey by the Central Statistics Office for the final quarter of 2004, there were an estimated 84,000 students aged 19 to 22 years. Extending child benefit to this category would cost in the region of &euro;144 million per annum. Any change to the qualifying conditions for child benefit would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing demands for available resources.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to child dependant allowance was extended to age 22 from October 2003, where the parent of a full-time student has been in receipt of a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more. Short-term schemes include such payments as unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance. The provision already applied to recipients of long-term payments. In addition, family income supplement is payable to low income families in respect of children aged up to 22 years while the child remains in third level education.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health service executive payments towards their additional heating needs during the winter season.</P>
        <P>It is a long-standing policy within the scheme that fuel allowances are not payable in cases where a person has access to his or her own fuel supply, or is benefiting from a subsidised heating service, such as that provided by Dublin City Council at a number of its housing complexes.</P>
        <P>In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, the Department recently ceased fuel allowance entitlement which had been paid in error in a number of cases where recipients were in local authority accommodation with subsidised heating. The allowances were withdrawn in these cases with effect from the start of the winter heating season.</P>
        <P>Fuel allowances were paid in error to these people in previous years. In some instances, fuel allowance was awarded because the applicants indicated that their heating costs were not being subsidised. It could be considered to be inequitable to retain the fuel allowance in these cases when neighbouring tenants in the same circumstances are not eligible and are managing their budgets accordingly. Nonetheless, I am conscious of the particular circumstances which apply in the cases concerned and I am reviewing the position now to see if there is scope to resolve the situation in the context of the budget.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that a range of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually improved by providing access to the wide range of payment options and new services and facilities now available.</P>
        <P>Current payment methods include payment at post offices by means of a pension order book, electronic or manual postdraft issued to the customer&rsquo;s designated post office each week, payment by cheque to the home addresses of customers and direct payment to customers&rsquo; bank or building society accounts by electronic fund transfer. Where possible, my Department provides a payment option which best suits the needs of customers. My Department does not promote the use of any one payment method over another.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Dublin north east area of the executive has advised that the sister of the person concerned applied for assistance with the cost of respite care for the person.

        <P>Social welfare supports available from my Department for carers comprise carer&rsquo;s benefit and allowance, as well as the domiciliary care allowance scheme administered by the Health Service Executive. Carers receiving payments through one of these schemes may also qualify under the respite care grant scheme administered by my Department. This grant scheme is not means-tested.</P>
        <P>Respite care grants are also available to those who are providing all-of-the-time care, but not receiving carer&rsquo;s benefit, carer&rsquo;s allowance or domiciliary care allowance, subject to the following conditions: the carer must be aged 16 or over, ordinarily resident in the State, caring for the person on a full-time basis, for at least six months &mdash; this period must include the first Thursday in June, for example 2 June 2005 &mdash; and living with the person being cared for or, if not, be contactable quickly by a direct system of communication, for example, telephone or alarm.</P>

	<P>My Department administers a range of back to education supports, under the umbrella of its employment support services, to encourage and facilitate single parents and others to return to work through the acquisition and improvement of skills and academic qualifications which will enable them to compete more successfully for employment. The programmes which the people concerned pursue range from basic literacy courses through to certain postgraduate university courses. One of the main supports provided by my Department is the back to education allowance scheme, which covers full-time second and third level courses.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is a social welfare income replacement scheme which is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that the applicant had been receiving prior to participating in the scheme. The allowance also has a number of unique features attaching to it. It is payable for the duration of the course of study, which in the case of lone parents, includes all holiday periods. The scheme itself is not means tested and, consequently, lone parents may take up part-time employment during the academic year and full-time employment during the summer period without affecting their payment. In addition, participants receive a cost of education allowance of &euro;400 which is payable at the beginning of each academic year. Participants also retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they had while in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment that qualified them for participation in the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of support to single parents to stay in or return to education is also addressed through the education system. With regard to first chance education, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science has in place a range of programmes for single parents wishing to stay in or return to education, including the home tuition scheme, the vocational training opportunities scheme and Youthreach. In addition, the Department of Education and Science provides child care supports for people participating in certain education programmes funded by VECs. In some cases, people accessing those programmes do so with the support of my Department&rsquo;s back to education allowance scheme. However, since its inception, child care support has never been a feature of the back to education allowance scheme <i>per se</i>.</P>
        <P>The question of such support to participants in receipt of the allowance would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other supports such as <Col N="288"/>those funded by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>In general, I am satisfied that the current arrangements ensure that my Department&rsquo;s back to education allowance scheme continues to support those who are most distant from the labour market, including single parents. This scheme is, however, being kept under regular review to ensure that it continues to support those in need. In addition, I am currently examining reports on the obstacles to employment, training and education for single parents in the overall context of social policy reform in this area.</P>

	<P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The purpose of the scheme is to assist long-term social welfare recipients who would benefit from full-time education. The scheme is not intended to support full-time students with income needs. At present, to qualify for participation in the scheme an applicant pursuing a third level course of study must be, <i>inter alia</i>, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 12 months or nine months if participating in the national employment action plan process.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is a student. He does not meet the qualifying period requirement and does not, therefore, satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme.</P>

	<P>To qualify for a full Christmas bonus, an unemployment assistance customer must have been in receipt of the payment for a minimum of 390 days prior to 23 November 2005. The person concerned has been in receipt of unemployment assistance since 15 July 2005. He had a previous claim for the period 29 September 2003 to 7 September 2004. For the purpose of deciding his entitlement to a Christmas bonus these claims were linked, giving a total of 386 paid days prior to 23 November 2005.</P>
        <P>On further examination, it came to light that a short period in respect of which the person concerned did not collect his payment, but during which it was subsequently confirmed he was <Col N="289"/>unemployed and entitled to payment, was omitted from the calculation of the number of payment days. Inclusion of this period in the calculation results in the person concerned being entitled to a full Christmas bonus payment this year. Arrangements are being made to issue the full bonus payment to him.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to increasing the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years to the level of the maximum personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. A number of special increases have been given over several budgets in pursuit of this target. In budget 2004, the rate of the allowance for persons aged 66 and over payable to invalidity pensioners was brought up to the level paid in respect of qualified adults who are 66 years of age and over on the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This involved a special increase of &euro;16.10 per week for this particular group of qualified adults and was one of the steps necessary to fulfil the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area.</P>
        <P>The cost, based on current rates of payment, of fulfilling the Government commitment in this area is &euro;47 million in a full year. In that context, further progress on aligning the relevant rates will be considered in budgetary context, and in the context of overall welfare reform measures.</P>

	<P>The rail freight market is to be opened to competition from 1 January 2006, in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 for domestic freight operations. Liberalisation is in accordance with EU Directive 2004/51/EC on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways. Significant progress has been made on the transposition of this directive and I will be finalising it in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14-?>My Department has already transposed a number of EU directives as preliminary steps for the liberalisation of the rail freight market. These include mechanisms for the licensing of rail operators and allocation and charging for track access. While no formal applications have yet been received for a railway undertaking licence or for track access, my Department has received a communication from an operator stating its intention to establish itself as a freight operator in Ireland.<?oasys _ic0-?></P>
        <P>As I have stated previously, it is my policy that Irish Rail remains in the rail freight industry and Irish Rail has made good progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, such as in the carriage of sugar beet, cement and pulpwood. Irish Rail continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present. However, as in all businesses, it must adjust the freight business from time to time to reflect changes in the market place.</P>

I am confident that 50 transport posts will be transferred to Loughrea by 2007 in line with the target. However, the decision to establish a Road Safety Authority which will take over many of these functions has required a number of issues to be clarified before assignments take place.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the planning, design, and implementation of transport infrastructure improvement projects including the carrying out of cost-benefit analysis is a matter for the implementing agencies as part of the appraisal process applicable to capital projects the information sought by the Deputy in relation to individual projects is held by these agencies. It should be noted that cost benefit analysis is only one element in the appraisal of transport investment projects. The appraisal also addresses environmental issues, safety benefits etc. In this context the outcome of a cost-benefit analysis is not simply a pass or fail criterion.</P>
        <P>The development of Transport 21 took account of investment priorities under the five-year capital envelope to end in 2009 and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the national road needs study. More specifically, my Department also engaged with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Trans<Col N="296"/>portation Office. This process enabled my Department to identify the broad direction and investment priorities for the ten year period. From this, the Department and its agencies developed the full scale of projects to be implemented under Transport 21.</P>
        <P>The projects within Transport 21 will be subject to normal statutory procedures where required, capital appraisal in line with the Department of Finance guidelines and the value for money initiatives set out in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s speech of 20 October 2004.</P>
        <P>Some elements of the overall investment programme, including metro north and the rail investment programme for the greater Dublin area, have had business cases prepared for them by their promoting agencies. These business cases included an economic evaluation. The outcomes of these processes will of course be kept under review to ensure that the projects continue to be in sympathy with the investment priorities and outcomes set out in Transport 21.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. The scheme is open to people aged 65 and over who have a genuine need for assistance under this scheme and is administered by community and voluntary organisations throughout the country on an annual basis with support provided by my Department.</P>
        <P>Having a closing date for receipt of applications allows my Department to assess the amount of funding sought under the scheme in a given year and to ensure that the funding available is distributed as equitably as possible to all applicant organisations. Given the nature of the scheme, my Department exercises a degree of flexibility in relation to the closing date. After the closing date and in circumstances where an individual requires equipment urgently, my Department will accept additional applicants to the group&rsquo;s application during the period of processing.</P>
        <P>While I thank the Deputy for his suggestion, I believe that the involvement of a local voluntary organisation in the delivery of this scheme sus<Col N="297"/>tains the link between the older person and the wider community, which is an important feature of the scheme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, in July 2000, on foot of a report carried out by P.J. Tobin and Co. Limited for my Department, I approved a grant of &euro;1.84 million to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cable car and associated services between Inis Bigil and Acaill at B&eacute;al an Bhull&aacute;in. This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of &euro;2.03 million with Mayo County Council to provide the balance of &euro;190,000. While it was hoped that the cable car would be fully operational by spring 2003, there was a delay because of an objection lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of land required for the project. While An Bord Plean&aacute;la subsequently confirmed the CPO, this decision became the subject of an application for a High Court judicial review. As a result of a settlement between Mayo County Council and the landowner, this application was withdrawn and subsequently Mayo County Council sought my Department&rsquo;s approval to proceed with the acquisition of land and the appointment of consultants to prepare contract documents for the project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In view of the time that had elapsed since this project was originally approved for funding, I decided late last year that it would be appropriate, in line with current guidelines and best practice for securing value for money for the Exchequer in respect of capital expenditure, to carry out a review of the 1999 report of the con<Col N="300"/>sultant engineers on the project. Consultants Malachy Walsh and Partners, in conjunction with McClure Watters, were appointed by my Department to carry out this review. In their final report, the consultants concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that the recent development of new piers on Inis Bigil and at Doran&rsquo;s Point over the past number of years had satisfied a key departmental objective to provide safe access to Inis Bigil and that if the cablecar project was to be progressed, it should only be done so within the context of an integrated tourism development plan for the Acaill-Ballycroy area, with the aim of maximising the tourism benefits of the project and other local tourist attractions, of which Ballycroy National Park is one.</P>
        <P>In the light of the latter conclusion and in view of the impending expiry of the time allowed for the issue of notices to treat in respect of the compulsory purchase orders on the land required for the project, Mayo County Council was authorised by me earlier this year to purchase the said land so that all realistic options for providing the cable car service could be usefully explored.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has engaged in discussions with both Ireland West Tourism and Mayo County Council with a view to ascertaining the tourism potential of the project and has consulted with the National Development Finance Agency and examined the feasibility of obtaining both public and private partners to build and operate the facility.</P>
        <P>The issue of whether to proceed with the preparation of contract documents for the project is now being examined by my officials in the light of this consultation process.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a meeting held in Belmullet in May 2003, which was the only public meeting that I attended in relation to the Shell gas terminal at Ballinaboy. On funding the gas line from Ballinaboy to Belmullet, the record of what I said at the meeting is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">I give a commitment here tonight that I will do all in my power and will use the money at my disposal, if this gas comes in, to try to make sure that a pipe is built from Ballinaboy to Belmullet. I have, year after year, as you know, put money into roads in this area and have put money into piers. The cost of a pipe would be in the region of &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million. My Department alone is spending &euro;9 million this <Col N="301"/>year in County Mayo. I think I will be able to find my share of the money to bring the pipe to anywhere where there is a likely useful need.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In line with the commitment given at the meeting, I will continue to work, as promised, to achieve the objective that gas, when available, will be provided to the town of Belmullet. I will also give favourable consideration to making funds available to achieve this objective, subject to State aid regulations, to CER approval and to the approval of other relevant Departments. However, given the current status of the overall Shell gas project, it would be premature to consider any specific allocation at this time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Funding is provided by my Department annually under a range of headings for promotion of the Irish language. The allocations and expenditures are set out in the Estimates volumes and appropriation accounts, as published, for the relevant years. As the Deputy will be aware the Abridged Estimates for 2006 have been published and final allocations will be set out in the revised volume to be published in the new year. It is not possible at this point to give an indication of the position beyond 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s strategy statement for the period 2005 to 2007 sets out the strategic goals for the Irish language for this period, namely to support the maintenance and strengthening of Irish as the principal language of both household and community in the Gaeltacht and to increase the use of the Irish language countrywide. Having regard to the strategy statement, my medium-term priorities are: to secure improved provision of public services through the medium of Irish on a phased, planned and agreed basis through the full implementation of the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003. This objective will primarily be achieved through the implementation of agreed language schemes by public bodies; to work and co-operate with other relevant Departments and agencies in ensuring that appropriate resources are in place in order to comply with the obligations associated with the Irish language becoming an official and working language of the European Union and European institutions with effect from 1 January 2007; to progressively increase the availability of third level education through Irish, particularly outside <Col N="302"/>the Gaeltacht and by institutions other than those that have already a tradition in this regard, in association with the Department of Education and Science, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge and the Higher Education Authority and to continue to fund, support and co-operate with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta with a view to its achieving its overall objectives of developing the economy of the Gaeltacht and encouraging the preservation and extension of the Irish language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under its recently published statement of strategy, which is available on its website <i>www.udaras.ie</i>, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s sets out its principal areas of focus for the next number of years, which are: to continue to provide funding for the Gaeltacht improvement schemes which are administered by my Department, in order to continue with the programme of capital grants that are available to improve Gaeltacht marine works, improve Gaeltacht roads, and provide or improve community and leisure facilities such as community halls, playing fields and other such facilities. The aim of these grants, through developing infrastructure, is to improve the economic, social and cultural life of Gaeltacht areas as well as strengthening the Irish language as a community language in these areas; to continue to fund the Irish language schemes designed to conserve and promote the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht and to ensure that these schemes continue to be administered as efficiently as possible and reviewed and modernised where necessary; to continue to financially support Ciste na Gaeilge which provides assistance for the promotion of the Irish language through various agencies and projects. As part of Ciste na Gaeilge, I am establishing three subsidiary funds with effect from 2006 to promote the teaching of the Irish language in third level institutions overseas, to support partnership initiatives involving local authorities and the business community in the promotion of the Irish language in their local area and to promote research on the placenames of Ireland. Finally, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s will continue, as appropriate, to avail of the advice of F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge in overall pursuit of the stated objectives of the Department in relation to the Irish language in general while having specific regard to the F&oacute;ram&rsquo;s brief as set out on its establishment in 2004.</P>

        <Quest>the allocations made by his Department under all headings to Irish language groups for each of the past five years for promotion and preservation of the Irish language; if he has assessed the programmes and plans of the organisations concerned; and if he has satisfied himself as to their validity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding is provided by my Department annually, both directly and through other bodies, under a range of headings for the promotion and preservation of the Irish language. In so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, it is intended to continue with the programme of capital grants that are available under the Gaeltacht improvement schemes, which are administered by my Department to improve Gaeltacht marine works, improve Gaeltacht roads and provide or improve community and leisure facilities such as community halls, playing fields and other such facilities. Grants are also paid under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts to qualifying applicants in the Gaeltacht to build new houses and for improvements to existing houses. The aim of all of these grants, through developing infrastructure, is to improve the economic, social and cultural life of Gaeltacht areas, as well as strengthening the Irish language as a community language in these areas. The Gaeltacht also benefits from a range of social and cultural schemes, designed to assist in the preservation and promotion of Irish as a community language. These schemes include well established ones, such as sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge and the Irish summer colleges scheme, as well as new initiatives such as the language planning initiative, sc&eacute;im na gc&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga and sc&eacute;im na gcampa&iacute; Samhraidh. Reviews of a number of these schemes and of associated expenditure programmes have been carried out in recent years.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides substantial funding to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, whose primary responsibility is to develop the economy of the Gaeltacht in order to strengthen the preservation and enrichment of the Irish language as the main language there. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s also works, in co-operation with my Department, to promote community, cultural and language development activities in the Gaeltacht. The provision of assistance to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is contingent on its meeting certain requirements relating to employment creation and expenditure targets annually. It is also required to operate within a strategic framework approved by my Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments.</P>
        <P>Outside the Gaeltacht, funding is provided by my Department under Ciste na Gaeilge for the <Col N="306"/>promotion of the Irish language through various organisations and projects. The programmes and business plans of funded organisations are negotiated and assessed as part of the funding process. As already announced, I am establishing three subsidiary funds within Ciste na Gaeilge, with effect from 2006, to promote the teaching of the Irish language in third level institutions overseas, to support partnership initiatives involving local authorities and the business community in the promotion of the Irish language in their local area; and to promote research on the placenames of Ireland.</P>
        <P>My Department has also provided significant funding over the period in question, in conjunction with the co-sponsoring Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, to the North-South Body, An Foras Teanga, which comprises Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency. The primary purpose of Foras na Gaeilge, which receives three quarters of its funding from my Department, is to promote the Irish language throughout the island of Ireland, including support for Irish language voluntary organisations. The annual business plans for Foras na Gaeilge are jointly assessed and approved by both sponsor Departments and both Finance Departments and the business plans of funded organisations in turn are assessed and evaluated by the Foras. The allocations and expenditures under all the above headings are set out in the Estimates volumes and appropriation accounts, as published, for the relevant years.</P>

        <Quest>the projects which have been subjected to detailed cost-benefit appraisal in the past six months; the benefit-cost ratio which emerged from this test; if he is satisfied that projects being selected not only pass this test but represent a better return than competing uses for the same limited funds; and the way in which this process influences the size of the capital envelope for different project areas.</Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector require that a detailed cost benefit appraisal be carried out in the case of projects costing in excess of &euro;50 million. No such projects have arisen in my Department during the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal examines and makes recommendations on applications for additional quota from individual producers. The person named has applied to the tribunal in the current 2005-06 quota year and an acknowledgement letter has issued to him confirming receipt of his application form. The tribunal will examine applications between now and the end of the quota year in March 2006 and all applicants will be notified of the outcome in their case.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The person named applied for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve under category B which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. The position is that over 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants early in 2006. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed.</P>

	<P>At present, the only costs being met by my Department for meat and bone meal, or MBM, storage and disposal relate to the funding of three incineration contracts. These contracts provide for the destruction of surplus MBM stocks, which were taken over by my Department following the EU-wide ban on the use of MBM in animal feed. The contracts, which were placed in 2003 and are scheduled to be completed in 2006, provide for the storage, removal and incineration of over 172,000 tonnes of MBM. The total cost of these contracts amounts to approximately &euro;23.5 million.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an <Col N="312"/>application for consideration of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances in respect of his entitlements under the single farm payment scheme. As the medical evidence furnished in support of the application related to a broken ankle sustained in 1996 the application was deemed unsuccessful. An appeal was then submitted to the single payment appeals committee citing a number of medical conditions during 2000 to 2002. However the medical evidence furnished with the appeal was non-specific and as the stock numbers on the holding remained constant during 2000, 2001 and 2002 the independent single payment appeal committee recommendation was that the appeal should be disallowed.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the serious impact the nitrates directive will have on the pig farming industry which is a &euro;2 billion industry here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission on 29 July 2005. Following a consultation process, regulations giving legal effect to the action programme are expected to be available shortly. Ireland will then proceed with the case for a derogation, which proposes to cater largely for inten<Col N="314"/>sive dairy farmers and for grassland holdings importing manure from intensive pig and poultry farms.</P>
        <P>Throughout the discussions on Ireland&rsquo;s proposals, the European Commission has taken a firm position on the minimum storage capacity required for pig producers. It has also insisted that such storage facilities must be put in place at the earliest possible date. The nitrates action programme submitted to the Commission on 29 July reflects those discussions and therefore states that a storage capacity of 26 weeks is required for pigs and must be in place by 31 December 2006. However for small units a lesser storage requirement, 16, 18, 20 or 22 weeks depending on the zone, applies to holdings with 100 pigs or fewer, conditional on the holding having adequate spreadlands to utilise all the manure on the holding without exceeding nitrogen and phosphorus limits.</P>
        <P>While the implementation of the action programme will certainly have implications for pig producers, I believe that the level of anxiety being expressed in some quarters is excessive. I have taken measures to alleviate the impact on the sector, and farmers as a group can also do much to help each other.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates action programme, I have announced details of a proposed revised farm waste management scheme for which EU approval is now being sought. I hope early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming from the European Commission so that it can be introduced quickly. Under these proposals, pig and poultry producers will be eligible for the first time for on-farm investment aid, and grants of up to 70% will be available. Among other new elements, the scheme will introduce a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to maximum eligible investment of &euro;80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs and &euro;40,000 in the case of specialised slurry spreading tankers and related equipment. The scheme will increase the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from &euro;11,000 to &euro;15,000 with a grant rate of 20%.</P>
        <P>I also intend to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies to help the agriculture sector meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. The purpose of the scheme, details of which are being finalised at present with a view to an early introduction, is to look at new and emerging technologies for the treatment and possible use in bio-energy production of livestock manures, in particular from the pig and poultry sectors.</P>
        <P>The other issue facing pig producers will be having access to enough land to spread the quantities of slurry produced on their holdings in a way that meets the nutrient limits and other <Col N="315"/>requirements of the action programme. I am acutely conscious of the need for pig farmers to continue to have adequate spreadlands for pig slurry. In that context I will be asking Teagasc to undertake a very active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser, and I will be urging REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I will also be seeking to ensure that the necessary record-keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary.</P>
        <P>Furthermore there is much that farm organisations and individual farmers can do to promote the use of imported organic fertilisers such as pig slurry. It is in the interests of other farming sectors, such as the tillage sector that provides feed, to assist the intensive pig producers by considering the use of manure on their crops. Pig producers also need to be proactive in identifying and encouraging suitable recipients to take and utilise their manure. I would encourage the farm organisations to explore these possibilities.</P>

The enhancements included the payment of a flat rate of compensation in respect of any ram which, when tested between 1 September and 18 <Col N="316"/>November 2005, was found to be in one of those categories which are susceptible or highly susceptible to scrapie, provided that such rams are slaughtered on or before 30 November 2005.

        <P>Regarding imports of pigmeat, all such imports must be sourced from EU approved establishments applying the highest standards in veterinary controls, particularly in legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, residues programmes and other food law. A health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation must accompany pigmeat being imported from third countries. All consignments must first be landed at an approved border inspection post and undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. Once it has been established that the meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Community. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>

        <P>Under the relevant EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, each member state is subject to a regional beef quota limit.

The second age premium was supplemented by a payment from the Exchequer resulting in a final quota cut of 11.38% for those applicants. Only applicants with in excess of 25 animals were subject to this quota cut.</P>
        <P>As the person named applied on 43 eligible animals under the 2004 special beef premium scheme, it was appropriate to apply a quota cut on all animals.

        <Quest>the scientific analysis that has been carried out to justify the increased notional amount of nitrates produced by an individual sow and the consequential effect for the livelihood of pig producers in view of the proposed implementation of the Nitrates Directive.</Quest>

	<P Just="Left">The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The nitrates directive specifies a limit on the amount of livestock manure that can be applied to land, being an amount containing 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per annum. The directive also requires that the nutrient requirements of the crop to which the fertiliser is to be applied must be taken into account when applying fertilisers.</P>
        <P>Figures for the annual production of nitrogen and phosphorus by different livestock types were reviewed in the context of developing regulations to give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme. Analysis of current management practices on Irish pig farms necessitated a revision of the nitrogen and phosphorus excretion figures for pigs. Relevant factors on farms include changed feeding regimes, including use of the phytase enzyme, the increased number of litters per sow resulting in an increased number of pigs being sold and increased slaughter weights. Arising from this revision the annual nutrient excretion rates for nitrogen for sows, integrated unit, are increased from 67 kg per year to 87 kg per year but the rates for phosphorus are reduced from 22 kg per year to 17 kg per year.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the standard phosphorus value for pig manure is significant and will benefit pig producers seeking other farmers to take their manure. On most recipient farms it will be the crop phosphorus requirements that will be the <Col N="323"/>first limiting factor that will determine the amount of pig slurry that can be applied. Furthermore, there is scope for the replacement of chemical fertiliser with pig slurry on many farms, particularly on tillage farms, and farmers need to be aware of the savings that can accrue as a result.</P>
        <P>I am acutely conscious of the need for pig farmers to continue to have adequate spreadlands for pig slurry. In that context I will be asking Teagasc to undertake a very active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser, and I will be urging REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I will also be seeking to ensure that the necessary record-keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary.</P>

	<P>The Department of Finance&rsquo;s guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector currently require that projects of a value in excess of &euro;50 million be subject to a full scale cost benefit analysis. The Minister for Finance recently announced his intention to reduce this value to &euro;30 million as one of a number of new initiatives to obtain value for money from public sector contracts.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of capital expenditure in my Department relates to capital grant schemes involving relatively small scale investments by farmers and others in the agri-food sector. There were no capital projects costing in excess of either &euro;50 million or &euro;30 million, and therefore requiring detailed CBA, undertaken by my Department in the period referred to.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the Government decision to approve my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000, I asked the Garda Commissioner to review the eligibility criteria for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I initially increased the maximum age of applicants from 26 to 35 in time for the recruitment competition in November 2004. That change has had a significant effect, with a significant percentage of recent recruits coming within the extended age range.</P>
        <P>In advance of advertising the current Garda recruitment campaign, which commenced on 29 September last, I was keen to make any reasonable changes to the entry criteria that would facilitate recruitment from different ethnic backgrounds in our society. I am of the belief that future intakes of recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should as far as possible reflect the composition of Irish society, and my view is that this is an opportune time to ensure that the criteria for entry meet the evolving needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the society it serves.</P>
        <P>For this reason I asked the Commissioner to examine whether any of the eligibility criteria militated, however indirectly, against the recruitment of members from ethnic communities in Ireland. The main issue that arose in this context was the requirement to hold an academic qualification in Irish, a matter which, of course, is of particular relevance not only to those from different ethnic backgrounds but to all those who did not receive their schooling within the Irish educational system.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the Commissioner&rsquo;s review and following consultations with my colleagues in Government, in particular the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and with the Attorney General and the Garda representative associations, I brought proposals to Government and obtained its approval for the introduction of significant changes to the criteria for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations. Chief among these changes is that the requirement to hold a qualification in both Irish and English in the leaving certificate or equivalent has been replaced with a requirement to hold a qualification in two languages, at least one of which must be Irish or English.</P>
        <P>It is intended that recruits who do not have a qualification in Irish will undertake basic training in the language in the Garda College as part of their training, and the details of that language training will be finalised shortly in consultation with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>These changes will open up entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to persons in Ireland from all parts of the community and from all ethnic backgrounds. This is a hugely significant step which will help ensure that future intakes of recruits to the Garda <Col N="327"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflect the composition of Irish society to the benefit of the force and the people it serves.</P>
        <P>However, while the absolute requirement for Garda trainees to hold an academic qualification in Irish is now removed, Irish will continue to have an important place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All Garda recruits will be required to achieve an appropriate standard in Irish before becoming full members of the force, and basic training in Irish will be given to recruits who have no qualification in the language. Everyone who wishes to must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Indeed, proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force and that will continue to be the case.</P>

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that in 2004 two mountain bikes were allocated to the Bridewell Garda station for use by the community policing unit. However, due to wear and tear, both bikes became unavailable for use in July 2005.</P>
        <P>However, there are currently ten bicycles allocated within the north central division which are available as divisional resources. Furthermore, there are currently 40 mountain bikes on order awaiting delivery which will become available for allocation early in 2006. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that there are four garda&iacute; trained in the use of Garda mountain bikes in the Bridewell Garda station.</P>
        <P>Mountain bike units are engaged in mainstream policing, in conjunction with the community policing units, concentrating on areas such as parks and laneways, which are more easily accessed by such transport and supplement beat and other mobile patrols within the council area. The mountain bike units have been very successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour in local parks and estates and work well in conjunction with other units. Overall, the units have proven to be very successful to date due to their ability to respond quickly and effectively and capacity to provide a high visibility presence.</P>
        <P>Mountain bike units have made a significant and positive contribution to a proactive approach in tackling crime. Garda management has received very positive feedback from the community on the work of these units.</P>

The DPP will make this decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and-or statute law. As the DPP is independent in the performance of his functions, it would therefore be inappropriate for me to intervene in any way.</P><Col N="331"/>

	<P Just="Left">My concern about unacceptable elements within the private security industry was one of the reasons I brought forward the Private Security Services Act 2004 to regulate the private security industry. It should be noted that the Security Institute of Ireland is a separate body, independent of my Department and the Private Security Authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Private Security Authority is the statutory body established under the Act to regulate this important industry. The PSA has put in place stringent criteria to ensure that the private security industry operates to a high standard. In this regard, all applicants for a licence must undergo criminal record checks by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, be they employees, principals or directors of private security companies. It is an offence in itself not to disclose details of a conviction when applying to the authority for a licence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The authority commenced licensing contractors providing private security services in the door supervisor and security guarding sectors on 3 October this year, and licensing for suppliers and installers of intruder alarms commenced at the beginning of this month. The authority proposes to license all other sectors of the industry on a phased basis during 2006 and 2007. Licensing for individuals employed in the private security industry will commence next April.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 to 357, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There is currently a range of measures employed in the Irish Prison Service with the aim of eliminating both the supply of and the demand for drugs within the prison system. These include education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.</P>
        <P>Drug treatment services for prisoners involve a significant multi-dimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations. These programmes and interventions are delivered on an individual and co-ordinated basis by the psychology service, probation and welfare service, prison education service and prison officers. Particular initiatives put in place include drug misuse awareness programmes, support programmes and other appropriate health interventions, substitution therapies, vaccination programmes and treatment for viral illnesses. In addition, the Irish Prison Service provides prisoners with a range of opportunities to encourage them to adopt a drug-free lifestyle, thereby reducing demand for illicit substances.</P>
        <P>Many staff appointments have been made in this area in recent years and specific new expertise now in place includes the services of a pharmacist, deputy governor, with responsibility for drugs-related staff training, co-ordinator of drug treatment services appointed by the Health Service Executive, additional psychologists and a probation and welfare service team led by a senior probation and welfare officer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, many new health care staff such as a co-ordinator of prison nursing and 84 additional professional nurses have been appointed in the Irish Prison Service in recent years, as well as consultant psychiatrist in addictions sessions allocated by relevant Health Service Executive areas. However, it is accepted that the difficulties in appointing particular specialist staffing &mdash; for example, addiction counsellors &mdash; have arisen and have impacted on recruitment. These difficulties are being resolved and will allow further appointments to be made.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>Given the diverse range of general and specialist services providing drug treatment, which are not funded by my Department, and the fact that many of the prison employed staff carry out drug treatment work as part of a wide range of interventions, it is not possible to readily estimate the exact number of individuals who could be referred to as working entirely in the drug treatment area.</P>
        <P>I have recently held a seminar for prison governors on the new drugs policy for the Irish Prison Service, which I will publish in the coming weeks. This policy when implemented will bring a renewed focus on improving the organisational arrangements both within prisons and between prisons and the community to offer prisoners a more coherent and joined-up service. An underlying aim of the new policy is the operation of all programmes within a coherent policy framework, understood and supported by all agencies involved in drug treatment within the prison system. Such coherence is critical to the successful development of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment process which would assist in matching prisoners to the most effective and appropriate treatments and interventions available; the development of individualised programme plans for prisoners having due regard to their particular circumstances; and making provision for continuity of post-release treatment, care and support services.</P>
        <P>In addition to these new arrangements which are focused on improving the manner in which treatment services are organised, the new policy will involve the implementation of a range of new supply elimination measures such as mandatory drug testing, new visiting arrangements and the introduction of drug detection dogs.</P>

	<P>Section 16 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 provides that a video recording of any evidence given by a person under 17 years of age in respect of sexual or violent offences shall be admissible at a trial as evidence. My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a committee to draw up guidelines for persons involved in video recording interviews with a complainant aged under 14 years of age or with a mental handicap about a sexual or violent offence during an interview with garda&iacute; or other person competent for the purpose, which subsequently forwarded good practice guidelines to me with related recommendations.</P>
        <P>Devising a new mechanism to oversee the implementation of the guidelines by the garda&iacute; and the health authorities requires input from a number of Departments and agencies, including this Department, the Department of Health and Children, as well as the garda&iacute; and the Health Service Executive. This view is shared by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Department has, therefore, asked the Health Service Executive for its views on the most effective mechanism to oversee the implementation of the guidelines and also on the related issues of how a joint national training programme might be developed by the agencies involved and how suitable places to conduct interviews of the type in question might be made available. The Health Service Executive has indicated that it us currently examining the issues involved internally and will revert to my Department shortly.</P>

        <P>Resulting from the review, and in the absence of evidence from the contractor that he was in possession of a lease for the centre which would permit agency to consider extending the contract, it indicated to him on 18 November 2005, in compliance with its contractual obligations, that it did not intend to renew the contract beyond its expiry date of 18 January 2006.</P>
        <P>The contractor has since responded to the agency&rsquo;s letter of 18 November 2005 indicating that he is now in possession of a lease for the premises. The agency has accordingly entered into further discussions with him about the possibility of an extension of the contract in this case.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 25 April 2003 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 16 May 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>This person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 &mdash; prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>&mdash; of the Refugee Act 1996.

	<P>Since becoming Minister, I have been determined to eliminate the spiralling costs of overtime in the Prison Service. In this regard, I implemented strict budgetary controls and overtime costs have been reduced from &euro;58.9 million in 2003 to &euro;45.5 million last year. However, prison officers have, following prolonged negotiations, accepted a proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service, which will eliminate overtime working and its replacement with a new additional hours system. This new system, which has been introduced in four institutions and will be phased in to the remaining institutions before the end of February 2006, will substantially reduce the cost of extra attendance in the Prison Service. The introduction of the proposal for organisational change will contribute to a more efficient and effective Prison Service going forward into the future. Almost all prison officers received overtime payments during 2004. Approximately 13% of these earned under &euro;1,000. The average overtime payment awarded to prison officers in 2004 was &euro;14,000.</P>
        <P>The top 20 earners are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division. Local Garda management report that the question of a replacement Garda for Fethard Garda station will be considered during future allocations of newly attested garda&iacute; and where possible by way of interdivisional transfer for permanent garda&iacute;. Garda management also report that resources from Clonmel are utilised to augment Garda strength in Fethard as required. Garda personnel assigned to areas in Tipperary, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are constantly monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>With regard to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the <Col N="347"/>commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context the needs of Tipperary will be fully considered.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Tipperary division as at 1 January 1998 was 297, all ranks. The personnel strength of the Tipperary division as at 1 January 2005 was 316, all ranks. This represents an increase of 19 or 6.39% in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Tipperary division since that date. I am further advised that details of the number of garda&iacute; who were assigned to community policing duties in south Tipperary on 1 January 1998 is not readily available. However, the number of garda&iacute;, all ranks, assigned to community policing duties in the Tipperary division as at 21 June 2005 &mdash; the latest date for which figures are available &mdash; was ten. Constituency boundaries do not correspond to Garda divisional boundaries. Local Garda management states all members of the Garda have responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with community policing issues as they arise. All policing in the area referred to by the Deputy is community-based from existing and mainstream policing resources. Local Garda management also report the mountain bike unit is utilised to engage in high visibility policing.</P>

	<P>In the case of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, of my Department, <Col N="349"/>psychologists always obtain written parental or guardianship consent prior to undertaking educational psychological assessments. A similar procedure obtains where children are assessed by panel psychologists under the scheme for commissioning of psychological assessments, SPCA, which NEPS administers. Best practice requires the prior consent of parents or guardians where an assessment of a child is undertaken within the school by a professional person employed by an external organisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 to 391, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Four special needs assistants are employed in the school in question supporting the care needs of six pupils. The school&rsquo;s enrolment at 30 September 2005 is 611 pupils. A new general allocation system has been announced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. Under the new system, the school in question has a specific teaching allocation of four full-time teaching posts and ten part-time hours. In addition, the school has the equivalent of two temporary teaching posts to support the needs of pupils with low incidence special educational needs. The teaching posts being provided under the new general allocation scheme are designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with support appropriate to their needs. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. My Department, therefore, does not have details of the <Col N="350"/>number of pupils receiving such support within the school.</P>
        <P>My Department does not retain a record of pupils who are withdrawn from schools. I am, however, aware that one pupil was withdrawn from the school recently by the parents. The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is the national agency with responsibility for encouraging and supporting regular school attendance. Specifically, the NEWB was established to ensure every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives an education or participates in training. The local education welfare officer and special educational needs organiser are liaising with the parents of the pupil in question with a view to identifying a suitable school placement.</P>

	<P>The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into schools has been examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on foot of a report from a task group set up in 2000, which included representatives of the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Safety Council, the Garda, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, Rosary College, Crumlin, the CCEA Northern Ireland and the NCCA. The NCCA also commissioned a study on driver education in post-primary schools from Dr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College Dublin.</P>
        <P>The NCCA, whose role is to advise the Minister for Education and Science on curriculum and assessment issues, recommended that road safety be addressed within the context of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and that driver education, and specifically learning to drive for pupils aged 17, should not become part of the school curriculum. The NCCA noted this concurred with the practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of the 2001-02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for Transition Year and the Senior Cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road <Col N="351"/>users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road. In the preparation of the staying alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was positive.</P>

        <P>In accordance with the rules and programme for secondary schools, the approved course for the established leaving certificate must include Irish and not less than four of the examination subjects listed, all of which are optional: classical studies; ancient Greek; Latin; English; Hebrew studies; French; German; Italian; Spanish; history; geography; mathematics; applied mathematics; physics; chemistry; physics and chemistry; agricultural science; biology; agricultural economics; engineering; technical drawing; construction studies; home economics &mdash; scientific and social; accounting; business; economics; art, including crafts; music; Russian; Arabic; Japanese; and religious education.</P>
        <P>Rule 46 of the rules and programme for secondary schools and in my Department&rsquo;s circular M10/94 makes provision for exemption from the study of Irish in limited special circumstances. In the established leaving certificate examination, separate higher, ordinary and foundation level papers are set in the case of the subjects Irish and mathematics. In the case of the other subjects papers are set at both ordinary and higher levels. The subject economic history has been discontinued. It was examined for the last time in the leaving certificate in June 2005.</P>

        <P>In the post-leaving certificate sector, an additional 1,540 student places have been approved by my Department during 2005. The majority of these additional student places were notified to PLC providers on the basis of applications received earlier this year. A further 60 student places will be approved shortly. On the basis of a pupil:teacher ratio of 20:1.25, or 16:1 in whole figures, in the PLC sector, an additional 96.25 teaching posts would be available. However, at the time of writing, 74.29 posts have been taken up by schools.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department are in consultation with the relevant management authority and schools to ensure, in so far as possible, an entitlement to new resources under this initiative is applied this year. I am anxious that the schools should take up these posts. Lists of schools benefitting under the initiative will be prepared and sent to the Deputy shortly.</P>

	<P>The terms and conditions of the career break scheme for civil servants are agreed centrally by the Department of Finance. Child rearing is one of the purposes for which a career break may be approved. A career break consists of special leave without pay for a period of not less than six months and not more than five years at any one time. A career break may be extended in six monthly periods or in periods in excess of six months, provided the total period of special leave without pay does not exceed five years in all. Eligible staff may, in general, avail of two career breaks in the Civil Service. A second career break may only be taken when the officer has served for a period equal to the duration of the initial career break. The total period of the special leave should not exceed ten years in all.</P>
        <P>In the case of first and second level teachers, the terms and conditions of the career break scheme are agreed centrally at the teachers&rsquo; con<Col N="357"/>ciliation council. A career break consists of special leave without pay for a period of not less than one school year and not more than five school years. A teacher may engage in one career break spread over five years or may wish to participate, at varying intervals, in separate arrangements subject to the approval of the school authorities and the condition that the total period of special leave without pay does not exceed five years in all. In exceptional circumstances, the school authorities may authorise a teacher to commence a career break during the course of the school year. In such circumstances, provided the overall five year limit is not exceeded, the period of special leave will terminate not earlier than the end of the subsequent school year and is deemed to be a two-year career break.</P>
        <P>The existing terms and conditions for civil servants and teachers availing of career breaks are very generous. I am not aware of proposals to extend these time limits.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 to 429, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the rules and programme for secondary schools, the approved course for the established leaving certificate must include Irish and not less than four of the following examination subjects, all of which are optional: classical studies; ancient Greek; Latin; English; Hebrew studies; French; German; Italian; Spanish; history; geography; mathematics; applied mathematics; physics; chemistry; physics and chemistry; agricultural science; biology; agricultural economics; engineering; technical drawing; construction studies; home economics &mdash; scientific and social; accounting; business; economics; art, including crafts; music; Russian; Arabic; Japanese; and religious education.</P>
        <P>Rule 46 of the rules and programme for secondary schools and in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter M10/94 make provision for exemption from the study of Irish in limited special circumstances. In the established leaving certificate examination, separate higher, ordinary and foundation level papers are set in the case of the subjects Irish and mathematics. In the case of the other subjects papers are set at both ordinary and higher levels. The subject economic history has been discontinued. It was examined for the last time in the leaving certificate examination in June 2005.</P>

	<P>The Higher Diploma in Education Applications Centre, HDEAC, was formed in 1998 to accept applications for admission to the higher diploma in education courses offered by the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland at Dublin, Cork, Galway and Maynooth. The centre operates a common application and common selection process on behalf of the relevant universities. Trinity College operates its own application system. Advertisements are placed in the national press each year seeking applications from degree holders, across the range of subject areas required at post-primary level, to train as teachers for this sector. The position regarding mathematics for the higher diploma training programme for 2005-06 is that 558 applications were received from applicants with mathematics in their primary degree; 243 offers were issued with 198 acceptances and these students are currently pursuing the higher diploma programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that I have previously suggested changes to the H. Dip. programme to ensure an adequate ongoing supply of new entrants in areas experiencing difficulties in either recruiting or retaining teachers such as mathematics. I understand officials from my Department are working on this matter with the education departments of universities and the HDEAC.</P>

	<P>A second level teacher must hold, in addition to the required teacher training, a suitable primary degree or equivalent award, from a nationally recognised university or similar third level college, which is adequate to enable the holder to teach to the highest level at least one subject from the second level schools curriculum. The duration of such a degree programme must be at least three years of full-time study or equivalent. A suitable degree for the purposes of teaching mathematics to the highest level, that is, to leaving certificate higher level, is one where a person has studied mathematics as a major subject in the degree extending over at least three years. The criteria by which qualifications are assessed for the purpose of teaching individual <Col N="360"/>subjects, including mathematics, are set out in the document on the general requirements and subject specific criteria for teachers of recognised subjects and additional requirements for <?oasys _ch?>specialist teaching posts in mainstream post-primary education, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following address: <i>http://www.education.ie/servlet/blobservlet/rcst_qualification_requirements.doc?language=EN</i>.</P>
        <P>Qualifications already approved, and the subject or subjects for which they are recognised, are set out in the Registration Council booklet Appointment to an incremental position in a Secondary School &mdash; Necessity for approval of qualifications by the Registration Council.

	<P>Teachers trained outside the jurisdiction of the State, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period these teachers are expected to obtain their Irish language qualification, scr&uacute;d&uacute; le haghaidh c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, in order to become fully recognised. They must also provide certification that they have resided in the Gaeltacht while attending an approved three-week course or its aggregated equivalent.</P>
        <P>The following tables detail the number of candidates who sat for, passed and failed the SCG examination from 1998 to date in 2005. Information on the number of times candidates repeat some or part of the examination is not readily available in my Department. Such a breakdown would require an inordinate amount of official time to prepare. Up to 2004, my Department was responsible for administering the SCG examination. The cost each year has been in the order of &euro;100,000. In 2005, Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino was responsible for the SCG examination. My Department is making a contribution of the order of &euro;306,000 to Col&aacute;iste Mhuire towards the costs involved. It should be noted that this contribution includes provision for the once-off costs associated with the development of courses, the training of tutors and the provision of materials etc. in <Col N="361"/>addition to the cost of running the examination. My Department also funds the Education Centre Network, 21 full-time centres and nine part-time centres to deliver local courses based on locally identified needs and Irish language courses form a part of this local course provision. </P>

        <asker>Mr. Gregory</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the names and number of national schools in Dublin 1, 3 and 7 which have suffered a reduction in resource teachers during the school year 2005-06; the reason for the reduction in each case; if this matter will be reviewed in view of the high number of children with special educational needs in these schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[36411/05]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The specific information requested for schools in Dublin 1, 3 and 7 is not readily available to my Department. The Deputy will be aware that the general allocation of learning support-resource teachers, LS-RTs, is intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs. The system was constructed in order that LS-RT allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The new system has a number of benefits associated with it: it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; and it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services.</P>
        <P>In introducing the general allocation system transitional arrangements were also introduced whereby transitional hours were allocated to schools to cater for children for whom individual teaching resources had previously been allocated <Col N="364"/>but which it would not have been possible for the school to continue to provide from its general allocation. In the circumstances no child should have experienced a loss of resource teaching support. It has, however, always been the case that schools that were in receipt of resource teacher support in respect of pupils with special educational needs would lose teacher support, either full posts or part-time hours, when the pupils who triggered the extra support left the school.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances I do not propose to restore learning support or resource teachers to schools that no longer need them. It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation. Officials from my Department have discussed the concerns of these schools with the Irish National Teachers Organisation and requested that they send any information that they feel supports a case for additional special needs supports to my Department. We are awaiting full details in order that the case can be considered.</P>
        <P>There are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that in the next two years 500 extra teachers will be allocated in primary schools to reduce class size and tackle disadvantage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 434 and 491 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the general allocation of learning support-resource teachers, LS-RTs, is intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs. The system was constructed in order that LS-RT allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new system has a number of benefits associated with it: it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools <Col N="365"/>more certainty about their resource levels; it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; and it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services.</P>
        <P>In introducing the general allocation system transitional arrangements were also introduced whereby transitional hours were allocated to schools to cater for children for whom individual teaching resources had previously been allocated but which it would not have been possible for the school to continue to provide from its general allocation. In the circumstances no child should have experienced a loss of resource teaching support. The general allocation for the school referred to by the Deputies is two full-time teaching posts and 17.5 part-time hours. Prior to the introduction of the new general allocation system, the school had four special education teaching posts. It has always been the case that schools that were in receipt of resource teacher support in respect of pupils with special educational needs would lose teacher support, either full posts or part-time hours, when the pupils who triggered the extra support left the school.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances I do not propose to restore learning support-resource teachers to schools that no longer need them. It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation. I am satisfied that at this stage the general allocation system is working well and has been favourably received by schools. My Department will continue to work with schools and the education partners with a view to ensuring this remains the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. I am also pleased to advise the Deputies that in the next two years 500 extra teachers will be allocated in primary schools to reduce class size and tackle disadvantage. This will mean that class size will be significantly reduced in the coming years. This will benefit all pupils, including those with special educational needs in mainstream classes, including the school referred to by the Deputies.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that, following allegations of financial impropriety at the institution referred to by him, I asked the accountancy firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, to examine the use of moneys paid by my Department to the institution in question. The main findings of the review, which I published in early August, revealed that there has been no misuse of the public moneys paid by my Department to the institution in question.</P>
        <P>The report recommends, among other things, that a separate bank account be maintained in respect of the college in question. In that context, officials in my Department have met the management authorities at the institution in question, regarding the implementation of this and other recommendations in the PwC report. My Department is satisfied that the trustees and governing body of the institute in question are fully co-operating with the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>In relation to the financial position at the college in question, I have previously set out my views on this issue. Although my Department did not have any concerns regarding the use of funding provided for the purpose of training teachers, it was, nevertheless, important in view of the level of public and media interest in this matter, to demonstrate clearly that public funding was properly applied for teacher training. I am happy that the findings of the examination confirm this position.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student. It is only in cases where an appeal under section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct the school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB has indicated to my Department that <Col N="367"/>it will treat children for whom an appeal under section 29 has been unsuccessful as priority cases in offering such assistance. In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the appeals committee did not uphold the appeal but in its determination, the committee recommended that the educational welfare officer, EWO, in consultation with a special educational needs organiser, SENO, should seek an appropriate educational placement for the child. Both the EWO and the SENO were involved in the processing of the appeal and both have been informed of the outcome of the appeal and of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations. I understand the EWO has already been in contact with the family in this regard.</P>

	<P>Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act 1998 assign each board of management and principal teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools at both primary and post-primary level. Principals should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours. In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch breaks, assembly and dismissal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the rules for national schools and section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and-or on school activities. Accordingly, the responsibility of all teachers, individually and collectively, to provide a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the school in which they teach, including periods of supervision, remains. Special needs assistants, who may be assigned to schools to cater for pupils with significant care needs, may be required to assist such pupils, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>A person is considered to be a qualified primary teacher if she-he has successfully completed a teacher education course for primary teachers in a recognised college of education in the State; has otherwise successfully completed, in the State, a course recognised for the purposes of employment as a primary teacher or, if trained outside the State, has fulfilled all the requisite qualification and Irish language requirements. To be eligible for appointment to a teaching position in a vocational school, an applicant must hold a suitable qualification at degree level or equivalent in the subject or subjects of the post as advertised. In order to be appointed to a permanent teaching post in a voluntary secondary, community or comprehensive school, a person must hold an acceptable primary degree or equivalent together with an acceptable training-in-teaching qualification &mdash; the higher diploma in education or its equivalent. The decision as to whether a post should be filled in a permanent or temporary capacity is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school concerned subject to the approved level of permanent posts not being exceeded.</P>

	<P>Language development is a central element of the revised primary curriculum. Although the focus is on English and Irish, a number of primary schools also offer foreign languages. My Department launched a pilot project for modern languages in primary schools in September 1998. The aims of the pilot project <Col N="370"/>included the development of communication skills in four target languages which are French, German, Spanish and Italian, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in schools. To achieve these aims in the project schools the teaching of a modern European language to pupils in fifth and sixth classes was introduced.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to introduce Chinese at primary level. However, my Department is working closely with language experts from the Council of Europe to facilitate the analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary level, with a view to the formulation of an integrated language policy. This analysis will include the development of criteria for decision making on issues such as the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum. This will complement ongoing work by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which is engaged in reviewing languages in the post-primary curriculum and the feasibility of expanding provision at primary level.</P>

	<P>Copies of the policy document referred to in Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question have been received in my Department a few days ago. I note that the policy outlined by Conradh na Gaeilge proposes the following: that as part of their pre-service programme, teachers of languages at primary and post-primary levels would participate in a total immersion programme of one year&rsquo;s duration in a place where the particular language was the ordinary medium of communication; that as well as learning Irish, all students would learn one other subject through the medium of Irish; that one area of the curriculum would be taught through the medium of a foreign language; that separate Irish syllabi would be provided for native speakers of Irish and those who were learning Irish as a second language; that learning support programmes in Irish would be made available for students who had received part of their education abroad; and that State examinations would be available through a range of languages as presented by the non-national population.</P>

	<P>It is a fundamental principle of the primary and post-primary school curricula that due allowance should be made for individual student differences in ability, interests and circumstances. In accordance with this principle, the various programmes in Irish at first and second level are designed to cater for the learning needs of students with a wide diversity of learning ability. The study of an approved course in Irish at senior cycle is compulsory for all students, except those who have received an exemption from the study of Irish under the terms of Circular M10/94.</P>
        <P>In October each year, all post-primary schools make returns to my Department on all students and the subjects which they are being taught. Students who are not studying Irish and who do not have a valid exemption under the terms of circular M10/94 do not qualify for recognition for the purposes of capitation and teacher allocations. If, in the course of subject inspection and-or whole school evaluation, an inspector became aware of any instances of students who are not studying Irish and who have not got an exemption the school authorities would be requested to ensure that those students follow an approved course.</P>

	<P>The report of the Irish Language Commissioner highlighted the fact that despite appreciable time devoted to Irish in the school system, many students emerge from primary and post-primary education without achieving a reasonable command of the language. Particular concerns were raised about students&rsquo; command of the spoken language. While I absolutely accept that the standard of oral Irish, in particular, of many of our young people is not as it should be, it is important to note that significant efforts have been made by my Department in recent years to improve standards in the teaching and learning of Irish in our schools.</P>
        <P>The revised Irish language programme at primary level places a strong emphasis on oral Irish. This programme, implemented in all schools since September 2003 and supported by extensive in-service training by the primary curriculum support programme, should bring significant improvement to the standard of spoken Irish over time. This development at primary level complemented similar curricular changes at second level where syllabus reform is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements are being made in regard to the provision of materials and resources for the teaching of Irish. An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has been established to progress this area and to provide support services for schools.

	<P Just="Left">The leaving certificate syllabus in Irish at higher level aims to foster a positive attitude towards learning the language among students and to provide students with an experience of studying Irish that is enjoyable, as well as offering intellectual and emotional stimulus. Specific objectives of the course in relation to the skill of writing include that the students will be able to express themselves in language that is accurate and precise, that they will be able to communicate ideas confidently in writing and that they will gradually develop a personal style. In my view, the rote learning of material is not conducive to the achievement of these aims and objectives.</P>

	<P>The inspectors of my Department evaluate the standard of spoken Irish in the course of their work in school evaluation. Inspectors offer advice for the improvement of standards where necessary. They submit written reports to my Department which are then issued to the staff and management of schools. During the 2004-05 school year the inspectorate carried out a detailed evaluation of the standard of Irish and either English or mathematics in about 40 primary schools throughout the country. A detailed report on the outcomes of the focused evaluation will be published later in the current school year.</P>
        <P>Some criterion referenced tests of Irish have been carried out in primary schools in the past two decades. The work was carried out by Institi&uacute;id Teangeola&iacute;ochta &Eacute;ireann in co-operation with Department inspectors and also with assistance from the Educational Research Centre and Trinity College in the most recent instance. The report on the most recent survey of the attainment standards of pupils in sixth class across mainstream, Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools has just come to hand and my officials are studying its contents.</P>
        <P>My Department offers significant support to primary teachers for Irish through the primary curriculum support programme. Teachers get advice on the planning and teaching of Irish and there is also a cuiditheoir or advisory service through which staff are assisted in their own schools. It is a policy of my Department that at pre-service level, all student teachers as well as candidates for an scr&uacute;d&uacute; le haghaidh c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge must attend a three-week approved course in the Gaeltacht. This can play a very important part in developing the teacher&rsquo;s competence in oral Irish when taken in conjunction with the in-house work of the colleges of edu<Col N="375"/>cation. As the Deputy knows, a minimum grade C at higher level leaving certificate Irish is required of all entrants to pre-service teacher training and just over 41% of the marks derive from the oral and aural components.</P>

	<P>The minimum entry requirement for all undergraduate and postgraduate teacher education programmes for the primary sector is a grade C3 on a higher level leaving certificate Irish paper. This has been the position for more than ten years. As the Deputy may be aware, just over 40% of the marks for that exam derive from the oral and aural components. In the case of undergraduate programmes, interviews were held in all colleges up to 1991. Students are now accepted onto undergraduate courses in four colleges solely on the basis of leaving certificate performance, and applications are processed through the Central Applications Office. These colleges are Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, Marino Institute of Education, Dublin, St. Patrick&rsquo;s College of Education, Dublin and Froebel College of Education, Dublin. In the case of the fifth college, the Church of Ireland College of Education, applications are processed through the CAO and an interview is held as an element of the selection process. Part of the interview is conducted through the medium of Irish.</P>
        <P>Applicants to competitions for postgraduate courses, who have met the minimum entry requirements or approved equivalents, undergo an interview and an oral Irish test. In the case of Irish, courses accepted as equivalent include a pass in a university first arts examination, a grade C at GCE A Level, a grade C in the matriculation examination or the diopl&oacute;ma sa Ghaeilge from NUI, Maynooth. The selection procedure for these postgraduate courses, which has been laid down by my Department, sets out the grades and points which are to be allocated at both the interview and oral Irish test. Assessment criteria for the oral Irish test have been developed by the colleges which have responsibility for organising and managing the competitions. Applicants who get a fail grade on the oral Irish test are eliminated.</P>
        <P>Mature students for the undergraduate programmes have the option of applying through the CAO system or directly to the colleges. In the case of direct application, once candidates have <Col N="376"/>met the minimum entry requirements or approved equivalents, selection is on the basis of a competitive interview and oral Irish test. Applicants who get a fail grade on the oral Irish test are eliminated.</P>
        <P>Applicants to the on-line course, having met the minimum entry requirements, are interviewed and half of the interview is conducted through the medium of Irish. Applicants who do not meet the standard set by the college are considered ineligible for the course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there are many opportunities available to primary teachers to improve their proficiency in their spoken Irish. The cuiditheoireacht service, which is part of the primary curriculum support programme, PCSP, continues to support teachers in schools on the teaching of Irish. The training is conducted through the medium of Irish. The support service has also commenced a sustained support model of provision. It is a developmental approach to support the improvement and enhancement of the curriculum through one-to-one in-class teacher coaching.</P>
        <P>Each year, summer courses in Irish are provided by bodies such as Oideas Gael in Donegal and Gael-Linn which are at the appropriate level for primary sector teachers. Other summer courses deal primarily with the methodology of teaching Irish and these are conducted through Irish. Universities and some other third level institutions also run courses in Irish for adults and primary teachers can, of course, also apply to participate in these courses.</P>
        <P>A considerable number of primary teachers are involved in the delivery of col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh courses each year. Participation by teachers in these programmes allows them to develop and enrich their own competence in the language. In addition, my Department funded 25 Irish language courses, involving over 600 participants, which were provided as part of the 2005 summer course programme for primary teachers in line with the requirements of the revised primary curriculum. Some 600 primary teachers attended these courses throughout the country. The Deputy may be aware that extra personal vacation, EPV, is granted to such teachers in order to incentivise the learning of Irish in such a manner.</P>
        <P>My Department also funds the Education Centre Network, 21 full-time centres and nine part-time centres, to deliver local courses based <Col N="377"/>on locally identified needs and Irish language courses form a part of this local course provision.</P>

	<P>Revised syllabi for both the leaving certificate higher level and ordinary level in Irish were introduced in September 1995 and first examined in June 1997. The syllabi are built on the communicative approach to the learning of Irish and expect an integrated approach to the development of the four language skills, listening, speaking, reading and writing. The syllabi outline a range of topics recommended as a means of practising the language in real communicative situations. The list of topics is flexible so as to allow teachers to choose topics that are of interest to students. In addition, students study literature comprising prose texts and poems. The list of prescribed texts has changed a number of times since 1995, the most recent being September 2004 when a gearrscann&aacute;n, or short film, was introduced as an option for the first time. Language awareness and cultural awareness are integral components of both the higher and ordinary level syllabi. Full details of the current syllabi and prescribed material are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>There is provision for an optional oral examination in Irish at junior certificate level. Where schools opt to provide such an examination, the State Examinations Commission issues assessment guidelines to them for use by class teachers in assessing candidates. The optional oral Irish examination at junior certificate level is not assessed by the State Examinations Commission but by class teachers. Marks awarded by teachers are sent to the State Examinations Commission for processing without external assessment or monitoring. Candidates who take the <Col N="378"/>optional oral Irish examination are marked out of 400 marks, whereas candidates who do not take it are marked out of 320 marks.</P>

	<P>Officials from my Department have discussed the concerns of these schools with the Irish National Teachers Organisation and requested that they send any information that they feel supports a case for additional special needs supports to my Department. We are awaiting full details in order that the case can be considered.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the general allocation of learning support-resource teachers, LS-RTs, is <Col N="381"/>intended to cater for children with learning support and high incidence special educational needs. The system was constructed in order that LS-RT allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>The new system has a number of benefits associated with it: it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services.</P>
        <P>In introducing the general allocation system transitional arrangements were also introduced whereby transitional hours were allocated to schools to cater for children for whom individual teaching resources had previously been allocated but which it would not have been possible for the school to continue to provide from its general allocation. In the circumstances no child should have experienced a loss of resource teaching support.</P>
        <P>It is intended that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken within three years of operation. There are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 to 466, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The level of funding that my Department provides for Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided for Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Scoileanna L&aacute;nghaeilge, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional funding for Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The amount provided in 2005 was &euro;81,133. As I indicated in my statement on the publication of the Estimates for 2006, extra funding will be made available to the primary school management bodies, including Educate Together, and I will be in touch with them in the coming weeks about this.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, as Minister, I am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State. Applying <Col N="383"/>this provision to the development of multi-denominational education at primary level, my Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post-primary level the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through non-designated vocational education committee schools.</P>
        <P>To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for state-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band one rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable.</P>
        <P>These measures are a strong indication of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do so as part of its own statutory obligations and in the context of the national development plan which is structured to support the development of all educational sectors, regardless of ethos.</P>

	<P>My Department will be based in Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore. Three hundred and one posts will be based in Mullingar, which will be a new location for my Department. At present, 323 posts are based in my Department&rsquo;s office in Athlone, but following completion of the programme of decentralisation this will rise to 424. There will be some reorganisation of work to facilitate the moves to Mullingar and Athlone. This will impact on the existing office in Tullamore and will increase the number of posts based there by 3.5.</P>
        <P>The number of persons who are assigned to posts that will decentralise and who will relocate with those posts are 24 for Mullingar, four for <Col N="385"/>Athlone and one for Tullamore. The numbers of other Dublin based employees who have opted to move with the Department to either Mullingar, Athlone or Tullamore are 31 for Mullingar, 12 for Athlone and nine for Tullamore. These people will be assigned to units moving to their location of choice in the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of the programme of decentralisation my Department&rsquo;s presence in Dublin will consist of two regional offices, in Tallaght and Blanchardstown, and a number of members of the inspectorate and National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, who work directly with Dublin schools.</P>
        <P>This leaves a very limited capacity to reassign or offer alternative postings within my Department. For this reason, Dublin based employees who opt not to decentralise with my Department will be redeployed to other organisations in accordance with centrally agreed protocols as part of the implementation of the programme of decentralisation.</P>

	<P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes in respect of students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions and one maintenance grants scheme in respect of students attending approved post-leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <P>Generally speaking, all four schemes prescribe similar conditions which preclude students from grant assistance in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level or in respect of a course at a lower level than a course previously pursued, irrespective of whether a grant was previously awarded.</P>
        <P>Clause 6.3.6 of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses provides as follows: &ldquo;Grants may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. The vocational education committee will have discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness&rdquo;. This discretion would generally only be applied where the candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the 2005 PLC scheme, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in 2005-06. Generally speaking, candidates are ineligible for grant assistance if they already hold a qualification at FETAC level 5 or FETAC level 6 or a third level qualification at national certificate, national diploma, degree, postgraduate or equivalent level. In addition, candidates who have previously pursued, but not successfully completed, a PLC course are ineligible for grant assistance in respect of any subsequent PLC course. However, notwithstanding these conditions candidates who already hold an award no higher than FETAC level 5 and who subsequently pursue another PLC course at a higher level may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</P>
        <P>My Department understands the candidate to whom the Deputy refers has previously commenced a PLC course at FETAC level 5 in September 2003 and left in March 2004 without having obtained a terminal qualification. The student is currently pursuing a further PLC course at FETAC level 5, a different course from that previously attended. Accordingly, under the prescribed conditions of the PLC scheme, the student in question is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of her current PLC course.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should be aware that significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97.</P>
        <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers, including learning sup<Col N="391"/>port-resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1, projected, in 2004-05. As I indicated in my statement on the recently published Estimates, I have secured sufficient funding to provide for even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year. The Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum <Col N="392"/>class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary Circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P><Col N="391"/>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our schools promote, support and encourage healthy eating and physical exercise in a range of ways.</P>
        <P>With regard to educating students about making good food choices, a curriculum in social, personal, and health education, SPHE, is mandatory for all primary students and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. Health and well-being, with food and nutrition, are two areas dealt with under the Taking Care of My Body unit of that curriculum. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, pupils should be enabled to realise that they, as individuals, have some responsibility for adopting a healthy balanced diet and for taking regular and appropriate exercise.</P>
        <P>All second level schools have been required to provide SPHE as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. The aims of this programme include preparing students for responsible decision-making and promoting their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being.</P>
        <P>Physical education is also part of the curriculum at primary and post-primary level and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will, I hope, carry with them into adult life.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from curricular provision, schools can implement measures to encourage physical activity during school breaks. Schools already play a major role in promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P><Col N="396"/>
        <P>Together, the above initiatives ensure children not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. Schools are playing their part in terms of promoting a healthy diet and adequate physical exercise for children. However, it is important to remember that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school. Therefore, schools can only do so much with regard to promoting exercise and healthy eating and the main role must rest with parents.</P>
        <P>With regard to the advertising of unhealthy foods to children in schools, the position is that schools are privately owned, privately managed institutions which, although funded by the State, enjoy a large degree of autonomy. It is, therefore, primarily a matter for the board of management of individual schools to devise policies around the types of food that are available on the school premises and such policies should be driven by the needs and welfare of the students. I know that many schools have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents&rsquo; associations, and I would encourage others to do so.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the significant <Col N="397"/>number of applications which continue to be made to the Residential Institutions Redress Board, she will consider extending the closing date for receipt of such applications or in the alternative accept all such applications as being valid in terms of time pending receipt of the further and additional relevant information; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 8 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that applications may be made to the redress board within three years of the establishment of the board. This means that the statutory closing date for receipt of applications by the board is 15 December 2005. The board has made arrangements for applications to be received at the board&rsquo;s offices up to midnight on that date and has placed adverts in the media recently highlighting this arrangement.</P>
        <P>The board also issued a statement on 25 November 2005 which addressed the validity of applications received up to the closing date. In this statement the board accepts that an applicant may have difficulty providing some information with regard to matters such as proof of residence in an institution before the closing date, but it expects that applications submitted by the closing date should at least contain an outline of the nature of the abuse and those responsible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, section 8 of the redress Act enables the board to extend the period for accepting an application if the board is satisfied there are exceptional circumstances with regard to a particular application.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the provisions made for receipt of applications by the board. I do not intend to extend the deadline as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Child protection guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, which were distributed to primary and post-primary schools in 2001 and 2004 respectively, were produced in consultation with the partners in education to meet the needs for schools to have in place clear procedures which teachers and other school staff should follow where they suspect, or are alerted to, possible child abuse.</P>
        <P>The guidelines cover four types of abuse, neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse and sexual abuse. The guidelines provide management authorities and staff with guidance with regard to recognising the signs and symptoms of child abuse and with procedures for dealing immediately with such concerns.</P>
        <P>A central facet of the guidelines is the requirement for each board of management to designate a senior member of staff as the designated liaison person for the school. The designated liaison person will act as a liaison for the school in all dealings with the Health Service Executive, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other parties, in connection with allegations of and-or concerns about child abuse and as a resource person to staff who may have child protection concerns.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 487 together.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>The post-primary school to which the Deputy refers is heavily oversubscribed as a result of a significant number of pupils enrolling from outside its catchment area. The cumulative effect of the development of this type of situation over a number of years can impact negatively on pupils from within the catchment area who are entitled, as of right, to a place in a particular school. It also invariably impacts negatively on the school or schools to which these pupils should rightly attend and in which considerable capital investment has been made for this purpose. It is a matter for all school authorities, in the context of their enrolment policies, to limit enrolment to within their catchment areas to ensure such situations do not arise.</P>
        <P>As a once off exceptional measure, my Department decided that a number of named pupils from outside the catchment area to which the Deputy refers would be allowed to enrol in the post-primary school in question for the 2005-06 school year. This decision was taken because the pupils concerned had an expectation that they would be enrolling in the school and did not have sufficient notice to secure alternative placements.</P>
        <P>It was made clear to the school authority in July this year that this arrangement would apply for the 2005-06 school year only. It was made equally clear that the arrangement did not create a precedent and that it would not be repeated in subsequent years. I am satisfied that there are adequate places for the enrolment of the pupils in question in schools in their own post-primary centres. I am also satisfied that adequate notice has been given to the particular school concerned to ensure it implements an appropriate enrolment policy for the 2006-07 school year in the best interests of its own pupils. In the circumstances, my Department&rsquo;s position in this matter remains unchanged and a meeting to discuss this aspect further would not serve any useful purpose.</P>
        <P>With regard to the new post-primary school for Gorey, my Department will be engaging at the appropriate time with the authorities of the existing post-primary school concerning the process and arrangements that will be required to ensure a smooth transition from a one post-primary <Col N="400"/>school centre to a two school centre. Part of this process will involve defining the enrolment policies and catchments areas, within the existing Gorey catchment area boundaries, that will underpin effective provision once Gorey becomes a two school centre.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should be aware that significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97.</P>
        <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers, including learning support-resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1, projected, in 2004-05. As I indicated in my statement on the recently published Estimates, I have secured sufficient funding to provide for even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year. The Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in the Department&rsquo;s primary Circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P><Col N="399"/>

	<P Just="Left">Under the current staffing schedule for primary schools, an enrolment of 12 recognised pupils at the end of September 2004 is required for the employment of a principal and one mainstream classroom teacher. However, the provisional enrolment figures, which have been submitted to the Department, indicate that a minimum of 12 recognised pupils were enrolled in a number of schools which currently have one teacher and, on this basis, the schools concerned would qualify for the appointment of a mainstream teacher in 2006.</P>
        <P>Following detailed consideration of the position of these schools, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, as an entirely exceptional matter, I have decided that a mainstream class teacher may be appointed in those schools immediately rather than with effect from 1 September 2006 which is the position which would normally apply in these circumstances. The boards of management of the schools concerned are being notified accordingly.</P>
        <P>A detailed review of the position of the schools with less than 12 recognised pupils is being undertaken and will be completed as speedily as possible.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the restricting guidelines whereby some children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are ineligible for resource teaching if their disability is classed as mild with an IQ of over 49; her plans to amend the situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation system has been introduced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.</P><Col N="402"/>
        <P>My Department issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools recently regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>The professionally-assessed needs of the individual child determine the appropriate model of response in each case. It would appear that a significant percentage of children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome have been assessed as having a mild general learning disability which comes under the high incidence disability category. Such pupils fall to be catered for from within a schools general allocation of resource teaching support.</P>
        <P>The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child. I would like to stress that there is nothing to stop the school from allocating one-to-one resource teaching support to any pupil if they feel that this is the best type of support to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where a Down&rsquo;s syndrome child has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability categories, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation. Such applications should be <Col N="403"/>referred to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, by the school.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to large scale primary and post primary school projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As he will be aware, earlier this year the Department of Finance published capital appraisal guidelines relating to the need to undertake formal structured auditable assessments of new capital projects as follows: Value of project needed. If less than &euro;500,000, a simple assessment; if between &euro;500,000 and &euro;5 million, a single assessment; if between &euro;5 million and &euro;30 million, a multi-criteria assessment, MCA; and if over &euro;30 million, full cost benefit analysis. As no school capital project generally exceeds &euro;30 million, full cost benefit analyses are not routinely carried out.</P>
        <P>However, my Department is obliged at all times to provide a suitable cost-effective accommodation solution for the delivery of every school building project. Therefore, every application for capital funding is subject to a rigorous assessment of the absolute need for the project in the first <Col N="404"/>instance. Once need has been established, an examination of the most cost effective method of delivering the project is then carried out. This examination is underpinned by a technical and professional report.</P>
        <P>All approved projects are then further subject to my Department&rsquo;s published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which were revised last year following consultation with the education partners. In applying the prioritisation criteria, all approved projects are assigned a band rating and the progress of individual projects is considered on a top down basis in accordance with its band rating. I am satisfied that overall, the processes undertaken by my Department ensure that value for money solutions are achieved and that these solutions are delivered in accordance with the most urgent needs presenting.</P>

	<P>I would refute the Deputy&rsquo;s characterisation of Casement Aerodrome. Red safety areas were first adopted <Col N="405"/>at Casement Aerodrome following a review in 1992 by Aer Rianta, on behalf of the Department of Defence, of policy on safety zones at the aerodrome. International civil aviation organisation standards and recommendations on obstacle limitation surfaces for airports as well as considerations in regard to public safety in the vicinity of the aerodrome were taken into account in determining the size and shape of the red safety areas at Casement Aerodrome. While the Snow report, prepared in 1999, to which the Deputy refers, contains discourse regarding safety zone determinants adopted by certain regulatory authorities such as the CAA and FAA and arrangements in other countries, the recommendation in the case of Casement Aerodrome contained in the report was that the approach areas be retained for security and safety reasons because of the large proportion of training, including single engine and solo flights by inexperienced pilots, carried out at the aerodrome.</P>

	<P>Financial incentives such as direct grants for the construction of environmentally friendly houses are not available from my Department. However, my Department, in conjunction with other Departments and agencies, supports and promotes a number of measures to achieve more environmentally friendly houses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards energy efficiency, many effective measures to improve energy efficiency in houses can be achieved at negative or zero equivalent annual cost to the householder. Information on a broad range of energy efficiency measures may be obtained from Sustainable Energy Ireland. Under its house of tomorrow programme, Sustainable Energy Ireland focuses on improving the energy performance of Irish housing. The main focus of the programme is on stimulating widespread uptake of superior sustainable energy planning, design, specification and construction practices in both new home building and refurbishment of the existing stock. Grants available under this scheme are principally designed to support demonstration projects and are available for a number of housing units and not for one-off houses.</P>
        <P>The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, 2002/91/EC, will also introduce requirements which will encourage the construction of environmentally friendly houses. Among the requirements of this directive is the introduction of a buildings energy rating, BER, certificate which would be required when buildings are constructed, sold or rented out.</P>
        <P>A draft action plan for the implementation of the directive in Ireland was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, for public consultation earlier this year. The action plan was drafted by an inter-departmental working group drawn from the Department of the Environment, <Col N="409"/>Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and SEI. Work is now at an advanced stage in revising the draft plan to take account of the feedback. The definitive action plan is due to be submitted to the EU Commission by the end of 2005. The building control Bill, which is expected to be introduced before the end of the year, will include <i>inter alia</i> legislation to give effect to some of the requirements of the directive. It is also planned to amend Part L, conservation of fuel and energy, of the national building regulations to give effect to other requirements of the directive.</P>
        <P>Finally, the question of encouraging the voluntary installation of energy efficient and renewable energy technology in newly built dwellings is being actively considered in a current review of Part L, conservation of fuel and energy, of the building regulations and the related technical guidance document, TGD-L.</P>

	<P>While local authorities have primary responsibility for ensuring efficiency and value for money in their activities, my Department is actively involved on a <Col N="410"/>range of fronts to ensure that this is achieved and monitored. Some key initiatives in this regard include the following.</P>
        <P>The first report on service indicators in local authorities, published in July 2005, details the performance of local authorities in 2004 with regard to 42 indicators of service. This is a significant innovation for the local government sector which has taken a lead in accounting publicly for the quality, including efficiency, of services it provides to its customers. The 2004 data provide a valuable baseline against which future performance can be assessed. I have asked each authority to review its own performance across the range of indicators and in the light of performance by other authorities, and to put in place a strategy for continued improvement.</P>
        <P>Full implementation in 2004, in co-operation with local authorities, of new financial management systems based on accrual accounting principles and incorporating balance sheets is designed to deliver better management information and more enhanced management capacity and to facilitate improved efficiency and value for money measurement. My Department is building on this work by developing a standard costing system for the sector to deliver a more detailed level of information in relation to services particularly in relation to unit costs. This new system will facilitate local authorities in comparing their costs over time and with other local authorities.</P>
        <P>The value for money unit in my Department undertakes in-depth analyses of local authority activities, identifies best practice, and measures economy and efficiency in the use of resources in individual local authorities. Value for money audits will be carried out by local government auditors in addition to their normal regulatory audits of local authorities.</P>
        <P>In so far as efficiency in the management of individual capital projects is concerned, local authorities are expected to comply fully with, <i>inter alia</i>, the value for money considerations set out in the following standard Government procurement guidance: The Department of Finance&rsquo;s guidelines of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector; where appropriate, requirements for undertaking public private partnerships as set down by the Department of Finance; and public procurement procedures, both national and EU.</P>
        <P>The introduction of five-year multi-annual capital investment programmes provides a structured basis for the planning and delivery of all capital programmes in a way that enhances efficiency.</P>

	<P>The football pitch referred to is on machair habitat within the Inis M&oacute;r candidate special area of conservation, cSAC. Planning permission for its development was obtained in 2000. Because of the implications of the development for the SAC habitat, my Department provided advice to Galway County Council and the planning applicants in relation to necessary mitigation measures. For this purpose, advice was also obtained from an expert on soil conditions for playing pitches to the effect that importation of topsoil from outside the site was unnecessary and should not be undertaken.</P>

	<P>Since the introduction of the Government&rsquo;s homeless strategies, there have been significant developments in the provision of a wide range of additional accommodation and services for homeless persons. Since the introduc<Col N="414"/>tion of the integrated strategy in 2000 some 1,000 extra emergency beds have been provided in the Dublin area alone. Rough sleepers have been enabled to access emergency accommodation and homeless persons have been facilitated to move out of emergency accommodation into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities, together with specific provisions to meet the needs of people with alcohol or drug addiction problems or who are sleeping rough, as well as homeless ex-offenders, have been put in place.</P>
        <P>Rough sleeping is the extreme manifestation of homelessness and statutory and voluntary agencies work in close co-operation to minimise it. In Dublin, where the largest incidence of rough sleeping occurs, Dublin City Council operates a night bus service where clients are given access to accommodation and appropriate outreach services. This service, which originally operated as a cold weather response, now operates on a year round basis. An on-line system to facilitate the prompt identification of vacant emergency accommodation on a nightly basis has recently been introduced by the Homeless Agency, with funding from my Department; this will ensure optimum use of the accommodation to meet the needs of rough sleepers. Rough sleeping initiatives also operate in the other main urban areas with specific measures put in place during colder weather if considered necessary.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to continuing to support local statutory and voluntary bodies in tackling the issue of homelessness. My Department&rsquo;s expenditure for the recoupment to local authorities of 90% of the cost of providing accommodation and related services for homeless persons in 2004 was &euro;45.73 million. The allocation for 2005 is &euro;51 million. This brings to &euro;240 million the total funding available for this purpose since 2000. The Department of Health and Children has provided an additional &euro;30.2 million in the same period to meet the care needs of homeless persons.</P>
        <P>The outcome of the review of the implementation of the homeless strategies and their associated local homeless action plans will inform future policy developments in this area.</P>

        <Quest>if he intends to put a moratorium on mass incineration at the very least until proper baseline studies of dioxin levels at each proposed siting of a mass incinerator, particularly in view of recent comments from the Environmental Protection Agency that it was not possible to draw clear conclusions from sampling which has taken place in the Ringaskiddy area.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the question refers to media reports in the context of the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s study Dioxin Levels in the Irish Environment Third Assessment &mdash; Summer 2004. The attributed comment to the agency that it was not possible to draw clear conclusions from the sampling in the Ringaskiddy area is not linked to any EPA concern about levels of dioxin in the area. The agency drew attention to the levels being some ten times below the relevant EU threshold.</P>
        <P>The agency also stated that its investigations showed that the concentration of dioxins nationally were uniformly low by international standards and in decline. It should also be noted that in its previous report, Inventory of Dioxin and Furan Emissions to Air, Land and Water in Ireland for 2000 and 2010-2002, the agency demonstrated that 73% of dioxin emissions were generated by uncontrolled combustion activities, principally the domestic burning of waste and accidental building fires, whereas the then nine industrial incinerators operating in Ireland were responsible for just 0.015% of such emissions. In this report the agency also projected that thermal treatment of 1 million tonnes of municipal waste by 2010 would produce less than 2% of national dioxin emissions.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s waste management policy continues to be based on the internationally accepted waste management hierarchy. Incineration with energy recovery is a key element in this integrated approach, subject to rigorous and independent planning and waste licensing.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the conditions and restrictions imposed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Environmental Protection Agency are sufficient to afford a very high level of protection to the environment and to human health. In particular, the agency has confirmed to me that it does take into account environmental and human health issues when processing licence applications and that it is satisfied that facilities operating to licence conditions will not endanger human health or harm the environment. In these circumstances I do not consider that the issue of a moratorium should arise.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 648 of 15 November 2005. In addition to the strengthened and simplified enforcement regime introduced by the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Government has increased the resources available to planning authorities to carry out all their planning functions, including enforcement. Planning authorities&rsquo; staffing levels increased by over 40% in the years between 2000 and 2004, from 1,328 to nearly 1,900 full-time and part-time staff. Planning authorities are now also entitled by virtue of the 2000 Act, to require any person served with an enforcement notice to refund to them, the costs and expenses incurred in investigating the infringement and issuing the enforcement notice. Any fine for an infringement imposed by a court for a planning infringement must also be paid directly to the authority.</P>
        <P>While recent indicators, including the performance indicators published earlier this year, suggest an improved performance by planning authorities in relation to enforcement, I will continue to keep the implementation of the enforcement provisions of the 2000 Act under review. The recently published draft guidelines to planning authorities on development management also contain substantial advice to planning authorities on enforcement.</P>

        <P>The chairman of the board has indicated that a meeting was held with representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association in September 2003 to discuss general matters in relation to planning.

This will assist the board to deliver decisions on strategic infrastructure projects as quickly as possible, while taking full account of proper planning and sustainable development.</P>

	<P>Section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 provides that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may grant to the master or other person in charge of a pack of stag hounds, a licence authorising the hunting of deer by that pack, during such period or periods as is or are specified in the licence. Legal advice was obtained through the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in 1999 confirming the long-standing interpretation of section 26, to the effect that it provides for the licensing of carted deer hunting irrespective of the status of the deer, wild or captive.</P>
        <P>A regional wildlife official of my Department again raised questions relating to possible implications of a definition of &ldquo;wild animal&rdquo; in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, that is, that if the deer hunted by the Ward Union Hunt were not covered by that definition, the Ward Union Hunt might not in consequence require a licence under the Wildlife Acts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This issue was carefully considered in my Department and the conclusion was that as the term &ldquo;wild animal&rdquo; was nowhere used in section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 the operation of that provision could not be considered to be affected by the issue raised. On this basis, it was determined that the Ward Union Hunt required<?oasys _jy?><Col N="421"/><?oasys _fc?>to be licensed and a licence was granted for the 2005-06 season.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 542 and 546 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department does not maintain a register of land owned by local authorities. However, my Department carries out a survey of the total amount of serviced land zoned for residential purposes, owned privately and by local authorities, at the end of June of each year. This survey is valuable in assessing the overall stock of land at the same point each year, and the sufficiency of that stock to underpin required housing supply. Details from the June 2004 survey are published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 2004, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library, and on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, the Department has extended this survey to collate data on the amount of residentially zoned land owned directly by each local authority. However, we are not satisfied that the information received in its present form gives the overall picture of residentially zoned lands held by local authorities. We therefore have developed the 2005 survey further to improve the reliability and usefulness of the information to be collected. We are currently collecting and collating this information. This analysis would only provide a point in time assessment, as variation could be expected from year to year as lands are developed, particularly for social and affordable housing schemes. The Government has been focusing on measures to boost housing supply in response to demand. These measures are having success, with record output of some 77,000 homes in 2004. The availability of land that is serviced and zoned for residential purposes augurs well for future housing supply. Similarly in Dublin, output <Col N="426"/>exceeded 16,800 units in 2004, up 80% on 2000 levels, and there were some 2,300 hectares of residentially zoned serviced land available in June 2004 to support future supply.</P>

	<P>A comprehensive policy framework for addressing our waste management responsibilities has been put in place through my Department&rsquo;s policy statements Changing Our Ways &mdash; 1998, Delivering Change &mdash; 2002, and Taking Stock and Moving Forward &mdash; 2004. This policy framework is given effect through local authority statutory waste management plans, largely prepared on a regional basis, and the comprehensive legislative framework which now governs waste management in Ireland. The approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy which seeks to maximise prevention, reuse and recycling of waste, with thermal treatment with energy recovery being preferred over the environmentally least favoured option of landfill.</P>

	<P>Some &euro;3.7 billion will be spent under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 on the provision of water services infrastructure. Some &euro;2.2 billion of this will be spent on wastewater facilities. The EU urban wastewater Treatment directive requires specific wastewater treatment and-or collection facilities to be in place by 31 December 2005 for discharges from a graduated range of agglomeration thresholds. Record investment has meant that compliance with the end of 2005 requirements of the wastewater treatment directive, which stood at 25% at the start of the national development plan period in 2000, has now risen to some 90%. All remaining wastewater schemes required to achieve full compliance are included in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The treatment standards achieved by individual wastewater treatment plants are identified in the regular reports produced by the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to urban wastewater discharges. These reports assist local auth<Col N="427"/>orities in focusing on operational deficiencies, where they occur, and also help my Department to identify new infrastructural requirements for inclusion in the water services investment programme. The current programme covering the years 2004-06 includes 869 individual schemes, of which some 570 relate to wastewater infrastructure, and it is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">During the years 1992-99, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, carried out a nationwide survey of radon gas in domestic dwellings. The survey involved the measurement of radon for a 12-month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km by 10 km grid square throughout the country. The results of the survey were used to predict the percentage of houses in <Col N="428"/>each grid square with radon concentrations in excess of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre, Bq/m3, which is the national reference level in respect of houses. Grid squares where this percentage is greater than 10% are designated as high radon areas and such grid squares exist in every county. While the national radon survey was confined to domestic dwellings only, it is reasonable to expect that workplaces would also be at risk of exceeding the relevant reference level, particularly in high radon areas. Employers would be well advised to carry out surveys in these circumstances in the interests of health and safety. The RPII&rsquo;s website, <i>www.rpii.ie</i>, contains a comprehensive map which shows the location of high radon areas throughout the country. County radon maps and survey results can be viewed also on that website by clicking on the county by name.</P>
        <P>Epidemiological studies provide evidence that long-term exposure to high levels of radon increases the risk of lung cancer and that this risk is higher for smokers than non-smokers. The RPII estimates that about 200 lung cancer deaths annually in this country are linked to radon. In September this year, the RPII and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland issued a press release which pointed out that on the basis of a recent Europe-wide survey of the health risks of radon, smokers are 25 times more likely than non-smokers to develop lung cancer due to radon. Furthermore, the press release stated that the vast majority of the estimated 200 annual radon-related lung cancer deaths occurred among those who smoked.</P>
        <P>Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon, to urge householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to encourage householders with radon concentrations above the national reference level to undertake the appropriate remediation works. Every effort will also be made to provide information to householders and employers in order that they can carry out monitoring and remedial work effectively and economically should it be necessary.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 551 and 556 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Air quality assessment is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency and air quality management a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data. The EPA&rsquo;s Air Quality and Emissions to Air Report 2003 contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality, and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations operated by the EPA and local authorities, including details for County Kildare. The report states that the limit values for pollutants under the EU directives on ambient air quality were not exceeded in 2003. The report is available in the Oireachtas Library, as is Kildare County Council&rsquo;s annual report on ambient air quality for 2003-04. Neither Kildare County Council nor the EPA has drawn my attention to any particular issue in regard to air quality in County Kildare on the basis of the most recent data available to these bodies.</P>
        <P>The EPA has a statutory duty under the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 to make information available on ambient concentrations of all pollutants under the scope of the regulations. The EPA website provides real-time, publicly accessible, data from a number of monitoring stations nationally which allows the public to gauge air quality in relation to current EU and national standards. Alert thresholds for certain pollutants are in place for the purpose of triggering immediate action by the agency to inform the public where such thresholds are exceeded.</P>
        <P>Where the indicative level for any pollutant has been exceeded, the 2002 regulations place primary responsibility, following notification by the agency, on the relevant local authorities for the development of long-term air quality management plans to ensure compliance with the thres<Col N="430"/>holds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants. To date, no local authority has been notified by the agency to prepare such plans.</P>
        <P>Where there is a future risk of a pollutant threshold being exceeded and the agency considers measures are likely to be needed in the short term, the agency is expected to notify the relevant local authorities to prepare a short-term air pollution action plan to reduce the risk of a threshold being exceeded. The agency has on only one occasion to date on 20 April 2005, notified a local authority &mdash; Dublin City Council &mdash; of the need to prepare a short-term air pollution action plan to address a likely future exceedance of particulate matter at one monitoring station based on a comparison of the 2003 monitoring data with the limit values applying from 1 January 2005.</P>
