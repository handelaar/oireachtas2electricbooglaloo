    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When we raised the matter of the Ferns report yesterday I had only been handed it a brief time before the D&aacute;il met. Having read the report last night and as a father of young children, the words we used in this House yesterday barely do justice to the horror suffered by so many people, the victims of the abuse outlined.</P>
      <P>There is clearly a national consensus that we must deal with this type of suffering and institutional failure and ensure it never happens again. I believe that is accepted across the board. However, we must be particularly careful to guard against this report and its consequences being forgotten about when the next big headline comes along.</P>
      <P>One of my abiding impressions from this report is that many of the victims were not believed when they were children but were only believed when they were adults. It is evident throughout the report that a climate existed in this country where it was not safe for children to disclose abuse and where adults would be empowered to respond. We would be wrong and failing in our duties today for today&rsquo;s children and tomorrow&rsquo;s children if we did not admit or acknowledge that abuse can happen anywhere and not only in the institutions examined in this report. Therefore, there is a heavy responsibility upon this Legislature to respond promptly and appropriately to this very clear report.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach three questions about it. The Government indicated an intention to set up an inquiry into the allegations of abuse in the Dublin diocese. Is there a case for extending that inquiry and audit across the country? Second, I suggest that a comprehensive audit be carried out of all State agencies which deal with child abuse issues to ensure this country adopts best international practice in order to ensure children and young people are afforded the same respect, value and rights as adults. Third, the legislative changes recommended by <Col N="1094"/>the report, particularly relating to the creating of the offence of reckless endangerment and expanding of the remit of the Health Service Executive need to be clarified and should be brought forward with the greatest urgency. The Taoiseach might respond to those three matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that Members of the House only received the report when we were dealing with leaders&rsquo; questions yesterday. I had a chance to read a very large part of it last night, particularly the accounts of the witnesses; I had obviously read the recommendations prior to the Cabinet meeting. As I said yesterday, the report is a catalogue of serial abuse and gross dereliction of duty in the diocese of Ferns. It is shocking to everyone&rsquo;s sense of how our children should be protected. As I said yesterday, our thoughts go to the victims and their families and to the brave people who came forward. As Mr. Justice Murphy acknowledged, the fact that they were prepared to bring out the full horror of their situations serves us to try to make sure, as Deputy Kenny said, that these things do not happen again.</P>
      <P>Over the past probably 15 years as a result of the uncovering of many allegations, many of which have been proven, as many of the allegations in this report have been subsequently fully proven &mdash; and that is the position in other parts of the country and not only in the Dublin diocese &mdash; we have put on the Statute Book a number of laws, six or seven of which I mentioned yesterday, including the Protection for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, the Sex Offenders Act and many other pieces of legislation.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Murphy has given us a job to do. That is the important task we have today, namely, the recommendations of the report, some of them requiring legislative measures, with which we must deal. We must deal with those as quickly as we possibly can. The Government agreed on that yesterday. Mr. Justice Murphy specified the areas with which we should deal. In his view, and the Government agrees with him, the High Court should be empowered to grant orders against persons, including priests, who are a risk to children in order to restrain such persons from occupying any employment that exposes them to children. That is an answer to one of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s points. We are not only talking about priests but about everybody in a position of responsibility.</P>
      <P>It was acknowledged in the report that many organisations that deal with children in one way or another where there is not direct supervision have protocols to follow. It would serve us well for everyone concerned to examine those protocols. They should not wait for legislation to be enacted to do that. Anybody dealing with such situations should examine them, and I am aware many organisations do. Dr. Roderick Murphy&rsquo;s <Col N="1095"/>report on sexual abuse in swimming some years ago issued recommendations which many sporting organisations have passed. The second issue is that the Oireachtas should consider creating a new criminal offence around the issue of failure to protect children from injury or sexual abuse. That is set out in the report. That is an area we will deal with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny asked about the issue of the national audit. To deal just with Dublin would not hold up and I do not intend to do that now. We said all along we would await this report and see how best to proceed to a national audit or some means of investigation and how that should be done. We have not worked out how best to do that, but we will. The Attorney General has been examining this issue. Whatever we do, whatever way we do it and whatever terms or whatever remit or whatever form, it has to be wider. Two issues in this are important. Mr. Justice Murphy has been impressed with and recommends that the 1996 framework document as implemented in Ferns should be dealt with on a national basis and, equally, that the recommendations in his report should be dealt with. Whatever we do around the country, and I do not wish to give a suggestion off the top of my head, we have to work that out and we will do that very quickly. I think that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. In reply to a question yesterday from Deputy Rabbitte the Taoiseach, quite rightly, responded that he, as Taoiseach, could not answer as to whether similar incidents have occurred or are occurring in any other part of the country. Everybody here has had contact with priests of the Catholic Church who set out on their ecclesiastical business with the highest standards and who have always carried out their duties in an entirely responsible manner but there have been allegations that Ferns may not be unique. I accept the Taoiseach should proceed to deal with the Dublin diocese as quickly as possible. The Murphy report demonstrates that at quite reasonable cost a private inquiry like this can lay out a litany of truth about matters that took place many years ago. From that perspective, I think for the Catholic Church itself that a national audit would be in everybody&rsquo;s interest because where this abuse has existed it has to be cleared out once and for all and be dealt with. This report clearly outlines its own findings. Whatever decision is made with the Government in respect of the diocese of Dublin where there are some grave allegations also, perhaps that system should apply nationally and that, for once and for all, we can set in place not just protocols but the very best practice to ensure children now and in the future can and will grow up in an environment of respect and trust where their lives will not be completely <Col N="1096"/>and utterly destroyed. These are difficult choices and to legislate for each individual personality is difficult. I repeat that this side of the House will accommodate whatever the Government wishes to do in terms of implementing or legislating for that best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that we all have to learn from the mistakes of the past and especially but not only the church. The reality is that none of these issues was ever reported within the church authorities and even in the Garda authorities or in the health boards. Until 1990 it was a very different situation. This report, like other reports in other areas, has highlighted this issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Dublin diocese, we have already gone down the road a considerable distance in terms of preparation for the work there but had held back pending this report, which was the right thing to do. We can say categorically and we rightly expect that the 1996 guidelines will continue to be implemented fully in every diocese. The first thing that has to be done, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said this yesterday at the press conference, is to write to the dioceses to ensure that is happening. One of the issues that arose from Mr. Justice Murphy&rsquo;s report is that not only the guidelines but the inter-agency action that was taking place between the Garda, health officials and others had proved to be hugely successful in other areas. It is a question of whether that should apply everywhere and it is in the interests of the church. We all realise there are many people involved in the church who would abhor what is outlined in this report as much as any of us and for their own sense of being able to carry forward their own mission they would want to do this. The 1996 guidelines are the first issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The second issue is what is contained in this report and, obviously, it requires legislation. There will have to be new ways for dealing with people who deal with children. I have already mentioned the legislative change. The important issue is to ensure as best we can this never happens again in society. As I said yesterday I am conscious that clerical abuse of children &mdash; I do not know how people worked out the figure and I am not too comfortable working out the figure &mdash; accounts for 3% of abuse, which means 97% rests somewhere else. Many of these reports are equally relevant to other places but we are dealing with the Ferns report. We have to build on our knowledge to ensure it never happens again. When looking at the Dublin diocese we have to look at the nature and type of inquiry. There have been some suggestions by my colleagues already on how this could be done but until we work out a means of doing it I do not want to say something off the top of my head. We will deal with it. The audit will have to be on a national basis. <Col N="1097"/>It will mean looking at those who, perhaps, have been prosecuted. The inquiry looked at how these issues were dealt with, and not just that they happened. The upsetting aspect of the report is that normally when a person is in breach of something, and certainly on an issue as serious as this, as happened properly under Bishop Walsh in Ferns, they are removed and are out of the equation, but that was not what happened. We have to ensure that is not the position that pertains anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I said yesterday what I wanted to say on this terrible business and will come back to it when the Government&rsquo;s legislative proposals are ready.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the Government&rsquo;s response to the breakdown of talks for a new social contract and ask him to respond to the decision of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions not to enter into talks at this time, thus making the prospect of a new social contract less likely. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that this reveals the concerns that exist, quite widely, about the operation of social partnership, the handling of the dispute at An Post and the manner in which the necessary modernisation there is being driven, the manner in which the pensioners are being blackmailed as a factor in driving the programme of reform and the decision of Irish Ferries to dismiss its entire workforce and to employ people at reportedly less than half the national minimum wage? The Taoiseach will recall that on the day the D&aacute;il started this term I raised this issue with him and he denounced the practices being operated by Irish Ferries. Yet it is the issue of displacement, more than any other, and its implications throughout the economy that has caused the breakdown of the talks. Whereas the Taoiseach roundly condemned Irish Ferries that day he has not, nor have any of his Ministers, since said what he intends to do about it. His letter to the leader of SIPTU has completely failed to address the issue. The Taoiseach could do a number of things. For example, the Labour Party has prepared a Bill which seeks to build on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It addresses the question of whether a link exists between a flagship and the state in which it is registered and enables the Minister to prohibit a vessel being registered in a state to which no connection exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Taoiseach meant what he said about disapproving so vehemently of the practices Irish Ferries engaged in, why does he not take on board such a measure, which would enable the Minister to prevent a ship being registered in any country that can be thought of off <Col N="1098"/>the top of one&rsquo;s head with no connection of any kind between that state and the origins of the vessel? If the issue of displacement is not addressed with the consequent knock-on effect it could have in other areas of the economy, it is highly unlikely a new social contract would be agreed with all the implications that would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the decision of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions not to accept the invitation to enter talks on an agreement to succeed Sustaining Progress. I note the intention as proposed by SIPTU that clarification should be sought on what was envisaged in my letter to the president of ICTU. It did not, as Deputy Rabbitte said, reject that letter. It wanted clarification on issues of protection of employment standards.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the issue of An Post yesterday. There is a Labour Court decision on the matter and there are talks. The Minister has been directly engaged with the unions over a long and sustained period right up to late last week in an effort to try to resolve these issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct that the issue of Irish Ferries has created this difficulty. The company has made its decision. I have said what I have said and there is no need to say it again. I have said it many times since. I have said it to SIPTU members and ICTU members as late as last Thursday night and at several meetings, so they are very familiar with my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Words are cheap. The Government should introduce legislation to address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We must not forget the pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have repeated it many times outside the House. The leaders of SIPTU have met the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and discussed at length the issues of the legislation. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has also given his best assessment on it. We have also agreed with ICTU and SIPTU to exchange our legal situations on the matter to see precisely what we can do. For the record, at this stage I am advised it would be extremely difficult to deal with the issue of re-flagging in both Irish law and international law. That has been the advice. I wish there was an easy solution to this issue, but there does not seem to be. It does not seem to be permissible to change it, but the Attorney General is closely examining the matter and he has also looked at international law to see what we can do on it. I will exchange any of those facts with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to try to resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>An argument has been made over which I am deeply concerned. I have spoken to the senior <Col N="1099"/>management of Irish Ferries. I met the chairman and the chief executive. What I said here and much more I said directly across the table to them. Irish Ferries would argue, as would many others on the employers&rsquo; side, that it is a totally exceptional issue. There are grave dangers for social development in the country if we are to create a situation that employers can get rid of Irish workers who are doing a good job and buy them out whether it is at large levels of remuneration or redundancy or otherwise and replace them with people from eastern Europe or elsewhere at low cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government financed it in the case of the <i>MV Normandy</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are all kinds of arguments around that. Irish Ferries maintains it is not bringing in people on low wages. Its existing non-Irish staff are on quite large salaries; they are not paid below the minimum wage. The company has shown me the evidence and I must be fair in these matters. However, it is creating a difficulty and we are doing our best to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is appalling. However, what I and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are asking is what he will do about it other than condemning it. He allowed a precedent to be created in the case of the <i>MV Normandy</i>. Our money was paid to make the workers redundant while cheap labour was employed by the company. Is it any wonder it would then try to do the same on the central corridor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right and it was stated at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In the absence of any political will to do anything, the Taoiseach can easily get legal advice suggesting it might not be possible for one reason or another. We have prepared a Bill that would address the question of the link between the flagship and the state of registration. Will the Taoiseach give the Bill consideration? Does the Taoiseach not appreciate that the matter is wider than this issue? For example, compliance with minimum standards by contractors brought in here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government sought to bring in contractors and minimum standards were not observed. If Dublin City Council can have an arrangement with contractors that requires compliance with minimum standards why can this not be applied in the rest of the economy? Instead, <Col N="1100"/>the T&aacute;naiste went to Turkey and brought in a company that abused Turkish workers and the Government made a special arrangement with it not to pay any PRSI while they were here. Does the Taoiseach not appreciate that this matter goes wider than the issue of Irish Ferries as the Taoiseach claims? The unions concerned are concerned about non-invigilation of the construction industry where widespread abuse of workers&rsquo; rights goes on. This is a far wider canvas than the Taoiseach seems to want to admit. With due respect to its craftsmanship, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter goes nowhere towards resolving the impasse that has been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt directly with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU so I know what the concerns were. I will not listen to the Deputy telling me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have dealt with them also and that is not what they have told me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They told me the issues. The Labour Party was one of the parties in this House that advocated going outside the country to bring in construction companies and was very strong in its support for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We said they should comply with the standards here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the Taoiseach to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course any company operating in this country should comply with the law. I also readily admit that the culture in the country now is different from that in the past. Ireland was a country of emigration and high unemployment, and we did not have foreigners working here. It is now a different economy. There is a strong argument for improving the legislation we have. We have already given that commitment to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to SIPTU. As late as last Thursday morning the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, gave that undertaking to SIPTU. The wider issues have been addressed in discussions. A commitment was given that SIPTU and ICTU would be able to have an input and give their views on that legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has asked me whether I would look at his party&rsquo;s Bill and I would. The Deputy knows I cannot introduce legislation when I have advice that it would be unconstitutional. I cannot do that. I want to resolve this issue. The question is what we can do on the flagging issue.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice I have received is that we would not be able to legislate on flagships, as it would be contrary to matters that are set out in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>

	<P>I remind Deputy Joe Higgins that Deputy Rabbitte is well able to deal with his own leaders&rsquo; questions. The Deputy had his opportunity yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, I will look at the Labour Party Bill and I will continue to engage with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the legal advice. It asked me to share the legal advice and I stated I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ferns report throws a glaring light on a very dark period of suffering, criminal activity, complicity and an appalling conspiracy of silence. It is sickening and makes my stomach turn just reading it. People outside this House, as well as those here, want answers to two basic questions. First, how was it allowed to happen? Second, could it happen again?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As of now, I fear the answer to the latter question is that it could. With regard to the former question, I wish to ask about the investigation that has been promised. Does the Taoiseach think that we are going to find out why no Garda files existed prior to 1988 on the abuse cases in the Ferns diocese? Is it not shocking to learn about such a black hole in Garda files? More shocking still is the report that the office of the Garda Commissioner was aware of the abuse by Fr. Grennan and therefore, according to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the political masters of the Garda must also have been aware of it.</P>
      <P>It is also shocking to hear that a councillor tried to propose a motion concerning the sexual abuse at a meeting of the South Eastern Health Board but got support from only one other councillor. Will the investigation go as wide as it needs to go? Will it go from the Taoiseach and the Commissioner down and cover the health boards and the churches?</P>
      <P>With regard to the question as to whether this could happen again, the Ombudsman for Children is on record as saying that legislation in areas of her responsibility is not strong enough. There are many sections of the Children Act 2001 <Col N="1102"/>that have still not been implemented. The Sexual Offences Act of 2003, in section 10, regarding notification, states that we need better notification, that garda&iacute; need to be able to respond if somebody brings a report of a paedophile in an area to them. We know that the response is uneven. There is no direction, manual or handbook guiding the garda&iacute;. Is the Taoiseach aware if, within the Garda code, there is a proper response outlined for garda&iacute; in the event of information about a paedophile coming to light? Will the Taoiseach take action on that? Such action must be taken now and, indeed, should have been taken a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Mr. Justice Murphy sets out the position since 1962 so I will not go back over that. We must recognise that progress has been made in many areas. The garda&iacute; in the diocese, as per this report, have rightly prosecuted child abusers since 1990 and their omissions of the past have been corrected. Mr. Justice Murphy also emphasised the independence and integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over that period of 15 years. That is a considerable period of time, notwithstanding what was done by one senior member of the force in the past, which obviously nobody would stand over.</P>
      <P>The health board has shown a willingness and a determination to investigate. As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has pointed out, the whole issue now is to promote and foster a climate and culture of reporting child abuse in our society to achieve maximum disclosure. There are legislative areas that require more work and we will do that work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent mentioned protocols and the protocols in every area should be examined, based on this report. Many of the recommendations would be very helpful in updating such protocols and based on this experience, it is important that this is done. From the Government&rsquo;s point of view, while we have a number of Acts in place, Mr. Justice Murphy has pointed to two Acts in particular that should be dealt with and we have agreed that we will deal with them.</P>
      <P>We are examining how we can conduct an audit or analyse cases around the country where perhaps there have been prosecutions previously to try to make things right for the future. By building on the 1996 framework document and this report, we will try to make things better.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The good thing to come out of this &mdash; terrible though it is &mdash; is that we have a good basis for action. Hopefully, we will see co-operation from the churches, though obviously we must be satisfied ourselves and not leave matters to them. We must be satisfied that we have the powers to act, but we also need the co-operation of the churches and other areas of society so that we can take the experience of this, and other reports over the last ten or 12 years, to make sure we are seeing a <Col N="1103"/>change. This report seems to indicate that we have seen a substantial change in recent years, both in Ferns and elsewhere. It is now up to us to make sure that this remains the case and that change happens in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has not answered my questions relating to the pre-1990 period. I must ask him again, if, for example, he believes that it was right for the aforementioned councillor to only be supported by one other councillor. Is there not a veil of shame over the lack of political response when the information came to light? This information has been coming to light over a number of years, since the mid-1990s. Much of what is in this report would already have been known, one way or the other, though perhaps not in the graphic and horrific detail that is printed here. A large amount of information was already in the public domain.</P>
      <P>The register for people considered unsafe to work with children is still languishing under the heading of promised legislation. The Taoiseach has said this is due to a blockage because the Northern Ireland Assembly is not up and running. However, the PSNI has structures in place and has a handbook or manual on how to deal with people who come to it reporting incidents of paedophilia or of someone considered unsafe to work with children arriving in an area.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach now make up for a lot of lost time? Will he put in place a system, like the one in existence in the North, a type of vetting procedure which can tell a person if there is a conviction of, or suspicion around, an individual? In the South, only the health boards and a limited number of organisations, such as Barnardo&rsquo;s, can avail of such a vetting procedure. Youth clubs, dance clubs, scouting groups and so forth cannot avail of the vetting procedure. When will it become available? If someone running a cr&egrave;che wants to vet staff and calls the garda&iacute;, he or she will be told that the garda&iacute; do not have the resources.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of grave urgency and this report makes all the more stark the fact that the Government has not acted and responded in the way it should. We should have mandatory reporting of sex abuse allegations and we should have the resources in place so that people can be vetted. At the moment, neither of these is in place and events like those described in this report could happen all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot answer the question as to why people who had suspicions or information relating to people in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s did not come forward &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I have outlined the position in more recent years. Perhaps Deputy Sargent is not aware of what is already on the Statute Book because the Sex Offenders Act 2001, which provides for the monitoring of convicted sex offenders, has been on the Statute Book for over four years. We established the Garda central vetting unit over three and a half years ago to ensure that those working with children are screened.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>Expenditure by my Department from January 2005 to the end of September 2005 was &euro;19.845 million compared with a total Estimates provision for the year of &euro;38.965 million. While fluctuations <Col N="1105"/>in spending occur from month to month and some expenditures do not fall due until the end of the year, I am satisfied that overall spending by my Department for 2005 will remain within the agreed Revised Estimates for the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest European Commission report and research indicates that half of the people in this country have no opinion at all on the European constitution. Given this worrying statistic and the fact that the report was concluded under the flag of the Irish Presidency of the EU, will the Taoiseach undertake any further funding initiatives to enhance public awareness of the EU constitution? Where does he feel we are in this regard? We spoke before about taking elements of the constitution, named and proposed, that are uncontroversial and can be implemented. What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s analysis of the next two years as far as the document is concerned? Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to keep as high a level of awareness as possible in the public mind about what is happening and where he expects the European process and project to be in two or three years&rsquo; time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Since we last discussed the issue, the Government has produced the document, which has been well received, setting out the White Paper on the constitution. I hope it is circulated widely. The Department of Foreign Affairs has made it available through all the usual channels, including schools, libraries, public buildings and various organisations. I am aware from third level colleges and other organisations that there has been a good take-up on it, which has been useful. It will be important also for the Forum on Europe, which has been organising a structured debate, not just at their own conferences but for second and third level students in the weeks ahead, which is important. A number of national organisations have prepared various documents. NALA has produced an excellent document on the European project which I saw recently. All these initiatives are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Some 13 or 14 countries have ratified the constitution, while another few must do so. The situation in France or the Netherlands is unlikely to change for the next two years. I know from my European colleagues that most people believe they should continue with the constitution. While it would be possible to renegotiate it and omit parts of it, it would be very difficult. While the debate will continue for the next few years, eventually 18 or 19 countries will probably ratify it, which will put pressure on the remaining countries, including Ireland. Currently, there is no change in the French position. I note what some of the contenders for the French Presidency are beginning to say. This debate will unfold in the period ahead. The Dutch Government has said it <Col N="1106"/>will not return to the issue. There is no other initiative at this stage. It was agreed in June that during the Austrian Presidency next summer, the period of reflection will continue. This is happening in most countries, as is the case here. I attended a debate on the issue in the Seanad last week and the document is now available. Many of the organisations are actively organising seminars and conferences, which is good. Those of us in favour of the European project should promote that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, want to ask about the national Forum on Europe and the Estimates for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department. The Estimate for 2005 was 38% more than the 2004 figure. What were the revised figures following the Estimates in light of the failure of the European constitution to be ratified?</P>
        <P>What progress is being made on the task force on active citizenship on the basis of an Estimate in 2005 of &euro;500 million? On consultancy services, the Estimate was that there would be an increase of 77% over the 2004 figure. Is that what happened or was it just a case of allowing a lot of room for manoeuvre? Given that the price of petrol will continue to increase, which he may not have estimated, will the Estimate for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s car require to be revised upwards and will he consider running it on biofuel in the future? At least he will be guaranteed that supply.</P>

	<P>Or Corrib gas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good idea. I will suggest it to my Accounting Officer in order to keep down the cost.</P>
        <P>The Forum on Europe is an independent group. The Estimate is based on the forum&rsquo;s budget and the resources it requires. It is not prepared on the basis of what the Department believes is required. We have an input into trying to ensure it is not excessive. In recent years, we tried to make available as much resources as possible to help the forum and to allow it to extend its remits in travelling throughout the country and engaging with second and third level colleges. Their estimate is not one we try unduly to control or curb. We try to assist the forum in every way we can.</P>
        <P>I have given the detail on consultancies recently. As I said yesterday, most of the consultancies in the Department are in the social partnership process for various reports being drawn up under Sustaining Progress and in the policy unit of the Information Society Commission.</P>
        <P>On the task force on active citizenship, little of that money has been spent. As the task force is just getting up and running, it will be next year before it will have any real expenditure. Most of its work will be done in 2006.</P><Col N="1107"/>
        <P>On the Estimate for my car, as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility in this regard, the Deputy should put down a question to that Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not ask a question about consultancies while the Minister, Deputy Martin, is in the House. I will try to keep the embarrassment to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Can I ask the Taoiseach about expenditure compared to the Estimates and the dramatic increase in the cost of the Moriarty tribunal from approximately &euro;3.5 million to &euro;10.5 million in 2005? Will he tell the House what proportion of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, there are questions coming up on the Moriarty tribunal either later this morning or certainly next Tuesday. The third group of questions to the Taoiseach are on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Chomhairle, given my new mood of compliance with every stricture you impose on me, I will not pursue the matter.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach know what has been the cost of resort to the courts by third parties? Are they included in that figure or is it just the figure for which the State is liable in terms of lawyers and other costs, or does it include the cost of people going to the High Court frequently and so on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of subheads in my Department are currently showing expenditure under profile, including the tribunals. There are fluctuations in spending from month to month in this area. Under subhead K, the Moriarty tribunal, the Estimates allocation made a provision for the possible award of legal costs on completion of the work of the tribunal. That would be whatever the tribunal would deem to be a charge on the Department&rsquo;s subhead. We allocated a fairly large sum of money under the subhead for this year on the basis that it would be completed this year. However, as that will not be the case, the money will be returned to the Exchequer. Some &euro;5 million has been returned already.</P>
        <P>We are not yet aware what will be the various costs. We do not know that yet because all we have been doing for the past number of years is carrying a provision for costs. However, we do not know what that will be. I know from the Accounting Officer that the concern is whether the provision we are carrying is large enough if third party costs and so on must be paid by the State. It is a current issue, as we are examining the Estimates for 2006. It is hoped the tribunal will conclude next year and, therefore, the costs <Col N="1108"/>related to it will fall due. Clearly, the costs will be very large.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s first two reports were published, examined and reported on by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. The first report dealt with the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974. The second report dealt with bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and events elsewhere in the country prior to 1974.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s third report relates specifically to the murder of Seamus Ludlow and it was presented to the Government last year. The Government wishes that the report should be <Col N="1109"/>published in the form it was received from Mr. Justice Barron. In that context, certain aspects of the report have required careful consideration and were the subject of lengthy legal advice, including on the protection of the rights of persons named in the report. The Government has concluded its consideration of this matter. Officials from my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are preparing the report for presentation to the House. A motion to refer the report to the joint committee will be put to the House next week at the latest.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barron is finalising his fourth and final report. This report will deal with the Dundalk bombings of 1975 and certain other events elsewhere in the country around the same time. We can expect to receive this report in the coming weeks. It will then follow the same course as the other reports, namely consideration by the Government and by the joint committee. As of the end of September 2005, the total cost of the Barron inquiry was &euro;2.29 million. This does not include grants paid directly to Justice for the Forgotten.</P>
        <P>With regard to actions taken on foot of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Government has closely followed the approach recommended by the joint committee. It was recommended that a judge should be appointed in the first instance to conduct an investigation along Weston Park lines. We have been pressing the British Government consistently for action on this point. I indicated to Prime Minister Blair at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 27 June that, in the absence of progress, I would seek preliminary legal advice on the possibility of taking a case in the European Court of Human Rights. I have written to the Attorney General seeking preliminary advice on the matter and there have been a number of contacts between my Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office since then. Expert legal opinion has been provided and is currently under consideration by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. I therefore expect to receive his preliminary legal advice shortly. Contacts with the British Government aimed at securing further co-operation are also ongoing. I raised this issue with Prime Minster Blair again when I met with him on 11 October. Our actions in this regard will of course be informed by the legal advice we receive.</P>
        <P>The other main action taken on foot of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s work has been the establishment of the commission of investigation. The commission is examining certain aspects of the investigation in this jurisdiction of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, arising from findings made by Mr. Justice Barron. When the commission was established, with Mr. Patrick MacEntee SC as its sole member, it was asked to complete its work within six months, which would <Col N="1110"/>be mid-November. However, the work of the commission is dependent on co-operation from other people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Does the Taoiseach expect the MacEntee report to be finished by mid-November, given that it is dependent on other people? Does he expect it to be published? I am glad the Ludlow report is being prepared for publication and that the Taoiseach expects the report on the Dundalk bombing will also find its way into the system.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights recommended last March that the British Government should set up a Weston Park style inquiry into these matters. The Taoiseach raised this with Prime Minister Blair in October 2004 and June 2005. Has the British Government given a positive response to his query in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have an update on the work of the commission of investigation. I have heard nothing to indicate it will not be finished and I hope it will come in around this period of time. I have not heard of a problem with people assisting the commission but I do not have an update on its work. The Ludlow report will be published shortly and, hopefully, the Dundalk report and other related reports will be published before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The British authorities at all levels are very clear not only of my view and that of the Government, but also of the Opposition&rsquo;s views because this has been raised with them at several fora. They are well aware of the sense of the House and the country on this issue. They have not been enthusiastic by any means, to put it at its mildest, in moving to a Weston Park style tribunal. However, having sensed the view here of late, they have tried to pin down what precise information they might have that might assist us and we have engaged actively in this regard. I do not know whether anything will come of that but they have indicated they will try to deal with the information. We have been going through this process for a long time but they asked for the specific and detailed areas about which we wanted information. Prime Minister Blair reiterated that to me himself and said he would then raise it with MI5 and MI6 directly to try to get this information. That is encouraging but we have to wait to see whether he gets an encouraging response. The operation of their system is strange, although I have become quite expert on its operation. I will take the Prime Minister at his word anyway and we will try to see what we can do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last occasion the Taoiseach answered questions on the Barron report, he indicated he would consult the Attorney General regarding whether a case could <Col N="1111"/>be brought and sustained at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Do I understand from his reply that he has not received that advice, though he believes the Attorney General has concluded his assessment, or is he aware of his outlook? If so, will a case be taken? On the downside, if a case is not taken, is the Taoiseach examining other international remedies whereby the Dublin-Monaghan bombings issue and the failures of the British Government can be addressed?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that when the British Prime Minister rejected his call and that of the joint committee for a public inquiry, Mr. Blair said he had seen no evidence to support the charge of British collusion in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974? Does he also recall that Prime Minister Blair said the material assessed by the Barron investigation was insufficient to indicate if senior members of the British forces were involved in the preparation or the execution of those horrific attacks in May 1974? Did the Taoiseach address Mr. Blair on those points when he last met him? Did the Taoiseach forcefully impress on him that Mr. Justice Barron found that the farm of RUC reservist, James Mitchell, played a significant part in the planning; that RUC and UDR members were involved in the preparations; that the British forces had good intelligence from the start on who was responsible; and that the chief suspects were closely linked to British intelligence and the RUC special branch? Mr. Justice Barron made significant findings and these are among the points he made.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach point out to Mr. Blair his hypocrisy in saying Mr. Justice Barron had an insufficient basis on which to make his judgments while, at the same time, he and his government steadfastly refused to fully co-operate with Mr. Justice Barron in making access open to him to all material held on file in the North of Ireland or Britain relevant to these events?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What was Mr. Blair&rsquo;s response? Does the Taoiseach agree it is long past time a British government was held internationally accountable for its actions in 1974?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has given us an account of the report and his questions can be answered in the affirmative. The Government set up the Barron inquiry to get to the facts and ensure they were presented. The British Government is well aware of the contents of the two reports to date and will be aware of the contents of other reports.</P>
        <P>On the second point, the best way is to try to get full co-operation from the British side. We have worked with Mr. Justice Barron and have received co-operation in many areas. In other areas we have not and the view of everyone concerned, including the Oireachtas committee and the Government, is to try to get the British Government to indicate willingness to deal with the issues without judicial involvement or legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>I have answered Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question on what happened in that regard. I am pessimistic because one follows the process without receiving the information for which one hoped. We are endeavouring to narrow it down and Mr. Blair has stated he will proceed with regard to MI5 and MI6. Let us see what happens.</P>
        <P>While waiting for that I have asked for legal advice on the possibility of pursuing a case in the European Court of Justice. As stated in my reply, the Attorney General has also received advice on this issue. We are aware the European Court of Human Rights has rejected two complaints made by Justice for the Forgotten. A similar outcome has occurred in many other cases in other jurisdictions on the grounds of the length of time between events and proceedings.</P>
        <P>I have not seen the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice yet but over the summer much work was done on constructing a case, the appropriate grounds on which to take a case, who would be joined in proceedings and issues of time. The Attorney General is to present a report on this. I would prefer if we received the data and would like to state that I am optimistic about that but I am not. We must keep trying and Mr. Blair has stated he will try again, which I accept. In the meantime we will try to formulate our case rather than wait.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked if there is anywhere else to go. I do not think there is, the European Court of Justice is the only place where we can construct a case at this stage.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach mentioned that he met with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Tony Blair, on 11 October. Is the Taoiseach any closer to deciding if he will continue to hope Mr. Blair has a change of heart? Has the Taoiseach taken any further advice from <Col N="1113"/>the Attorney General on pursuing the matter through legal action against the British Government? The Taoiseach received the Ludlow report on 29 October. When will it be published? I understand the Barron report on the Dundalk bombings in 1975 was to be completed last Friday.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;third parties&rdquo;, a term that has caused considerable hurt to relations of the victims. In many cases they have been called victims in the past. The Taoiseach mentioned that funds available for legal representation do not include third party costs. Can the Taoiseach clarify what he meant by this? The families of people killed in the bombing are victims because they are the ones without a mother, father or relation and must live accordingly. Can the Taoiseach redefine third party and use the term more carefully?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat what I said already. The Attorney General was asked to commence preliminary advice and I will receive this in November. I have already mentioned the issues he will examine to see if we can construct a case. At the same time we seek to pursue a closer focus on information needed. In fairness, there was an argument about that because we sought a broad spread and this would have required considerable resources. We are narrowing down the information requested and will see if we receive a better response but I am sceptical.</P>
        <P>Is the Deputy referring to costs of the MacEntee commission of investigation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to check that for the Deputy. My officials had outlined the matter to Justice for the Forgotten and other groups representing relatives. I cannot recall what arrangements were made but I can check this and send the Deputy a letter. An agreement was worked out at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Taoiseach wish to make a statement on the case of Seamus Ludlow, a case I have raised on several occasions? As long ago as 8 March, and possibly before, the Taoiseach stated he was examining the report and that it would be published within a few weeks. There must have been reasons this was not done and I do not know how much the Taoiseach can reveal. It is an important matter, given the disclosures at the inquest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a long delay and a long legal wrangle. Two issues are responsible for the delay. Initially the report named individuals but left it to the Government to decide if names should be made public. These people were never arrested or charged. I felt <Col N="1114"/>uncomfortable publishing names as dissidents or others may take action against these people and we would have no defence against that. A long legal wrangle developed which is now resolved. The report will deal with it.</P>
        <P>There was a difference of opinion between garda&iacute; on what happened and how matters were handled. Two senior garda&iacute;, neither of whom was a commissioner at the time, took differing points of view. People went back and forth to Mr. Justice Barron to given their perspective but he must decide how to call this in the end. This went on for some time and I am not sure how it is called in the report. Two people had an entirely different view of the circumstances. In the normal course of events they were shown the section of the report that was relevant to them. Both gentlemen are elderly at this stage but one of them was not well and I understand it took some months before he responded. They were the two issues. In one I was not directly involved but I was involved in the second one. There is a difference between hearsay about the names of individuals that may have been involved and putting them into an official report that would be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is unacceptable for a state like Britain not to fully co-operate with the Barron inquiry? Is he aware that the victims and families feel let down by that lack of co-operation? On the issue of the Taoiseach seeking legal advice to bring a case in respect of this matter, does he agree it is a sad day for international law when this State must get legal advice from the Attorney General to pressurise another government to co-operate in the inquiry into the atrocity that was the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have spent a number of years doing our utmost, and Mr. Justice Barron has done a good job, to get as far as we can in the circumstances. It was hugely upsetting for the victims, the families and extended families that an examination or investigation was never carried out. It is welcome that is now in place and I know they are satisfied with it. What we can get the British to do and how we can bring the inquiry forward from here, continues to require careful consideration and I have already outlined what I will do on that. We should pursue the various issues, including the Commission of Investigation headed by Mr. MacEntee, SC, our seeking further information from the British and examining the European Court of Human Rights aspect. We may not get to the entire truth about all these events but far more information and data has been uncovered now than in the period of 30 years. That may not satisfy everybody but at least we have an extensive report on it. The British may not agree with all of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s <Col N="1115"/>report but at least it is a full report with conclusions on the information he was able to get from all the files he has received over the past few years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach agree that since he set the ball rolling in 1998 and appointed the then T&aacute;naiste, former Deputy John Wilson, to look into the matter followed by Mr. Justice Hamilton and then Mr. Justice Barron, the real problem is that almost a decade will have passed and we are still far from finality on this matter? None of the survivors, the bereaved or members of Justice for the Forgotten are getting any younger and there is a palpable sense that we are moving very slowly on this matter. The one area in which progress has been made is the Commission of Investigation under Mr. Patrick MacEntee SC, which I am delighted is coming to finality because that is the only investigation we have established under this commission. We look forward to that report being published. It is a year since the Taoiseach got the Seamus Ludlow report, which we were informed on a number of occasions would be published shortly. It appears the difficulties the Taoiseach outlined to Deputy Rabbitte could be dealt with in the short term as easily as in the long term in respect of names that might have to be crossed out and the degree of editing that would have to be done because that took place in the previous reports also. The key problem we face now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach agree that since there has been no co-operation from the British Government to date on documentation coming before the Barron inquiry and on his request for the full implementation of the sub-committee&rsquo;s findings, namely, that the British Government would set up a Weston Park type investigation which may lead to a full inquiry in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are running out of time, Deputy. You have asked a number of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House the work he has done over the summer, which he promised to do when we last spoke on this issue, and will he make available the legal advice when he gets it from the Attorney General next month?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of June we asked the Attorney General to prepare his preliminary advice. He has also got advice on this because it is international law concerning the European Court of Justice, on how we can put together a <Col N="1116"/>case, who will join the proceedings, the limits and risks involved. That work has been done and we are due to get that report. We do not make available the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice in cases like that and we will not in this case either.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the position on the Seamus Ludlow report. The report was received in October 2004 and circulated to the relevant sections for their views at that stage. They were received back at Christmas. Meetings with officials took place in spring and it was decided that security advice was required, which was received in early summer. That security and legal advice was reviewed during the summer and a final proposed approach was drafted for consideration by the relevant Ministers. I outlined to Deputy Rabbitte the main issues in that regard. The report has been completed and is prepared for presentation.</P>
        <P>On the MacEntee report, it is hoped that is coming to a conclusion, although I do not have a final date. I should say the work on the Buchanan and Breen report is ongoing also. That inquiry is being chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick. We have gone back to the British, as I outlined earlier, on certain aspects. I do not know whether we will get anything on that but we have gone ahead on our European case. We will see what can happen on that but we are very near the end of our workload on this in so far as we can go. Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s work will be completed by the end of the year. I am not certain about Mr. MacEntee&rsquo;s report. The Cory report is under way. It appears to me the British Government does not want to go into a Weston Park type tribunal. If we cannot get the information from them we have to consider an alternative route. That would bring the work to finality in terms of how far we can go.</P>

	<P>The hepatitis C legislation is scheduled for this session.</P>
      <P>As regards the alcohol products (control of advertising, sponsorship and marketing practices) sales promotions Bill, voluntary agreements have been reached with the advertising industry.

During her reply she stated that this would be illegal under the packaging directive. However, in a reply, the Minister from the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, stated that article 15 of Directive 94/62/EC sets out that member states can adopt measures such as refundable deposits and it is up to the Government to decide if it is too costly.

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to resume my Second Stage contribution on this important Bill.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the Bill a few days ago a case was due to be highlighted on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; concerning a man who had been apprehended after a serious road traffic accident in which a taxi driver was killed on the side of the road. He was mowed down by a car coming at speed. Someone shouted for him to look out but it was too late and he lost his life. The incident was to have featured on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme but it was unfortunately pulled before transmission.</P>
      <P>The law appears to vary depending on who is involved in incidents. In this case, a man was involved in a fatal road traffic accident in which the victim had a wife and family yet no investigation was carried out as to whether the driver was under the influence of alcohol, although he had been seen in two public houses in the area and at a disco. He was not even breathalysed. I ask the Minister to urgently examine this case. The person involved in this fatal road traffic accident has caused terrible hardship and deprivation to the relatives of the victim. It is difficult to accept that somebody can walk away from such an accident without being breathalysed. The Minister must address this incident as a matter of urgency and amend the law to ensure that anybody involved in a fatal or serious road traffic accident would be breathalysed. Otherwise, we will not see any change in the number of terrible fatalities we have seen on the roads.</P>
      <P>Donegal has had its fair share of such fatalities. Many of these accidents are due to the fact that people do not obey road traffic legislation in terms of speed limits and driving under the influence of alcohol. If people think they can get away with such behaviour, they will do it. If one looks at the car parks of public houses any day of the week there are many cars outside yet the majority of these cars are gone after closing time. Only one or two conscientious souls leave their cars behind. The Minister should not tell me all those people are safe drivers. People are driving cars under the influence of drink because they know they can get away with it. People abhor the terrible consequences of drink driving and know the effects an injury resulting in premature death can have on the family of the deceased.</P>
      <P>People feel the law is not being upheld. In respect of the criminal justice system, we are talking about introducing anti-social behaviour orders although there are already adequate laws in place, such as the Children Act and liquor licensing legislation. These laws are not being enforced and they exist to ensure one can deal with the aforementioned activity.</P><Col N="1128"/>
      <P>We know there has been a 41% increase in the consumption of alcohol in the past ten years. We also know the major effect of advertising in this area, yet no changes are being made in response. The licensing system is in operation but the problem is the drinks industry controls the advertising of alcohol. We all know young people are influenced by what is going on around them and, over the years, we have all noted influences from outside this country. I am thankful that many influences no longer exert themselves. The Government can have a major effect on one&rsquo;s influences. Elected representatives in the D&aacute;il have an obligation to point out the issues that are important and in this regard I can think of none of greater importance to people than staying alive. Facilitating this is the job of this House and the Government.</P>
      <P>Garda&iacute; have discretion as to whether to breathalyse a suspected drink driver. However, it should not be discretionary but mandatory. I ask the Minister to consider this as a matter of urgency. In the case I mentioned, I wonder whether there could be a reinvestigation into what happened. I find it very hard to understand how, in cases where someone is fatally injured, the person responsible can be brought to court only on minor charges, such as the charge of driving with a provisional licence without being accompanied by a fully licensed person. I ask that the case in question be investigated.</P>
      <P>We, as citizens and parents, have a responsibility to ensure our children get the best possible chance in life. Every parent dreads that his or her children may go out at night and not return. When they get that phone call&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Drink driving legislation is now the responsibility of the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I therefore ask the Minister to talk to his colleague in that Department and pass on my urgent request. It is also a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because of Cabinet collectivity, and justice demands that it be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. It is one of many Criminal Justice Bills to have come before this House over many years. We have dealt with 60 Criminal Justice Bills since 1985. While many were to deal with circumstances in Northern Ireland, 40 were specifically aimed at creating new powers for the State. However, in spite of all those laws, headline crime has increased by 10% and the number of garda&iacute; per head of population has fallen from one per 331 in 1985 to one per 360 today. As with every other organisation, a percentage of the members of the Garda are tied up in bureaucracy and red tape. While I welcome <Col N="1129"/>the legislation, the problem is not necessarily the want thereof &mdash; it is a question of Garda manpower.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The explanatory memorandum to the Bill makes interesting reading. It states the Bill is to give the Garda more power in tackling criminals. It takes into account the recommendations of the expert group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law as recommended by the steering group. All sorts of groups are dealing with this but we want action on the ground to ensure the victim comes first, not the criminal. It is very clear that law without penalty is only advice.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is no secret that all a certain judge from my area ever did was ask people to put money in the poorbox rather than impose fines or jail sentences. Thus, they walked out of court without a sentence. Often they appeared before the court some months later only to receive the same judgment and thus preserve their clean records. We need to tighten up the law in this area. If people do not realise they must suffer for perpetrating criminal wrongs, they will simply repeat them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Let me refer to another example. A young man who was in considerable trouble some years ago and who had a number of fines imposed on him, perhaps to the tune of &pound;2,000, had to go to England because he could not afford to pay them. There was no way the Garda would accept his paying them on a phased basis &mdash; they wanted all or none. Some time later the man came back from England and his sister got him a job in a good factory. He was in the process of getting a loan from the credit union but the Garda apprehended him and landed him in Mountjoy. However, there was no room for him at the inn and he was sent straight back down the road with a &pound;20 note in his pocket to cover the expenses. I raise this issue because the Minister has failed to introduce a Bill to allow for a system of attachment of earnings in respect of either social welfare payments or people&rsquo;s incomes. This failure means there are more people in jail than there should be. The young man in question certainly felt no pain when he did not have to pay the &pound;2,000 fine at the time in question. His not having had to pay led to his becoming involved in crime again. His family and others were certainly not very happy with what happened.</P>
      <P>Last week we dealt with the Land Bill in the House. In dealing with it, the question of an attachment of earnings system arose. Although it is not directly related to this Bill, the failure to address it is part of the problem. Through the Land Bill, the Government insisted on introducing draconian measures such that if a farmer does not pay his annuities, the money can be taken from his EU funds, his creamery cheque or another source. The Minister refused to accept the Fine Gael Bill in this regard or introduce an <Col N="1130"/>alternative one to deal with the attachment of earnings.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this Bill that has caused much annoyance and anger is section 30, which deals with firearms. Firearms are held in the main by sports people, who use them to enjoy their sports. They feel very aggrieved that the issue of their control of firearms should be dealt with in the Criminal Justice Bill. Many small Bills pass through this House and there is no reason this matter could not be dealt with in its own right in a separate Bill, rather than by classifying as criminal the activities of sportsmen who hold guns legally and use them solely for sports. I have no problem with the matter section 30 deals with, namely, how guns are held and the need to ensure they do not get into the hands of subversives or anybody else, but the issue of controlling guns held by sports people should not be dealt with in this Bill. I ask the Minister to consider this point even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made many promises about increasing Garda strength and I am sure he means to deal with this issue but there is a serious criminal structure in the Border region, although thankfully we are finished with the activities of the Provisional IRA and such groups. People living near the Border find it virtually impossible to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at night.</P>
      <P>In answers to my parliamentary questions the Minister has frequently stated there is a sufficient Garda presence in the area. However, crime there has increased. On 18 October the Minister sent me a nice letter dealing with the situation and trying to explain what happens but there are serious increases in burglary and theft figures. In Cavan in 2004 there were 373 burglaries, compared with 243 in 2000, an increase of 50%; in the Monaghan district there were 249 in 2004 as against 172 in 2000, a 45% increase; in Carrickmacross the increase is thankfully only 20% from 189 to 227 in the same period but in the Bailieboro area the increase is 150% from 106 to 251; and in the Ballyconnell area the increase is from 62 in 2000 to 104 in 2004. These figures cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>As a public representative one hears about all the recent robberies of small shops in villages and out in the country. The robbers arrive in daylight, wearing balaclavas, carrying long knives and iron bars. This happened to one shop three times in three weeks. One can guess how scared is the family who own the shop.</P>
      <P>This Bill will strengthen our laws but we must bring in the personnel to support them. We must ensure there are garda&iacute; on the beat and burglars are conscious that garda&iacute; are about and available, and they cannot walk over ordinary decent individuals who want to run their businesses. The Minister can imagine how a girl behind a counter feels when, in the middle of the day, people come in wearing balaclavas, carrying knives and iron <Col N="1131"/>bars, and remove the till. This causes problems for the shopkeepers not only through the loss of money but because of all the records kept in modern tills.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister needs to recognise these events. While there may be less danger from the IRA, etc., in the Border region there is criminal activity to deal with and significant manpower is needed. I, and those who have spoken to me about this problem, appreciate there is more Garda activity as a result but what rights do people have if they must close their business? Will we give them the protection to which they are entitled? This is an extremely serious issue and Garda power must be provided to ensure it does not happen again. When burglars strike three times in three weeks one begins to have serious reservations about Garda activity.</P>
      <P>While it may not be relevant to the Bill, when the penalty points system was introduced there was a tremendous drop in the number of traffic accidents and road deaths because it was clear more garda&iacute; were on the beat. Unfortunately, that presence is gone and one can see what has happened recently in Donegal and Cork, and my area, where young people have lost their lives in accidents caused by speed and drink. Nobody can deny this. If there were more garda&iacute; on the beat at different times of day much of this trouble could be controlled.</P>
      <P>I am keen to see private companies deal with speed cameras but that is a different issue. It is necessary to make more garda&iacute; available to go on the beat and have fewer tied up in bureaucracy. To achieve this the Minister need only bring in other civil servants or personnel to deal with some of the office work that garda&iacute; do.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with many of the amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill, for example, reclassifying saliva and mouth swabs as samples for which consent is not required. Criminals must be identified and dealt with by whatever means necessary. I encourage the Minister to bring in the measures needed to achieve that. We have seen enough of events in Donegal to know the scene of the crime must be preserved and I welcome the efforts of the Garda to make sure that criminals are brought to justice. It is interesting to watch the painstaking efforts of the garda&iacute; at the scene to establish a link to the crime.</P>
      <P>I often wonder why we must release people so quickly despite the heinous crimes in which they have been involved. I welcome any improvements in that process. It is also important to control the use of drugs and associated activities. I congratulate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the drugs taskforces that have been so active and made so much progress in apprehending major drug dealers. There is no doubt drugs are still freely available even in small towns and villages and we must continue the efforts to curtail them as much as possible.</P><Col N="1132"/>
      <P>This is the time of year when fireworks are seen all over the country. What is the situation in this regard? The Minister might advert to it in his closing speech. We are told that fireworks are illegal, yet garda&iacute; are involved with family groups in organising proper fireworks displays, which I welcome. However, it is illogical that fireworks are illegal and are not supposed to be sold while at the same time, official personnel are involved in fireworks displays. Like any other illegal activity, there is a great glow to being involved in it because one is doing something that is not right. However, the situation is serious. At Hallowe&rsquo;en nearly every year there are serious accidents, with children&rsquo;s hands or even their eyes damaged as a result of fireworks.</P>
      <P>The situation must be clarified. The Minister said he would introduce appropriate legislation but we can no longer turn a blind eye and allow people to buy all the fireworks they want in Northern Ireland. One has only to travel along the Cavan-Clones road to see massive advertising hoardings informing one that 500 yards down the road, one can buy all the fireworks one wants. That is what happens with the free Border situation. We would be safer if we had a logical structure and knew exactly what the law is.</P>
      <P>A near neighbour of mine was recently in Mountjoy Prison as a result of a drink-related offence. Ideally, with social workers involved, that man should have been placed in some hospital or home to cure his alcohol addiction. It cost &euro;290 per night to keep him for three weeks in Mountjoy Prison. What most worried his family was that in prison he was among many drug addicts. We must take such matters seriously. Alcohol problems should be dealt with by the health structures and we should ensure drugs are not available in prisons. Alcohol and drugs do not mix. It was a great relief for the man and his family that thankfully, the prison system staff allowed him to move from Mountjoy Prison to Loughan House. Such situations are serious and not acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak. This is an important Bill. Some of what I hope to say echoes the views of my Border constituency colleague Deputy Crawford, particularly with regard to the bottom line of resourcing and dealing with issues which are as pertinent in Cavan-Monaghan as they are in Donegal, and no doubt other Border counties.</P>
      <P>I have looked closely at the resourcing numbers. For many years we had a good situation in terms of Garda personnel. In my home town we had 29 garda&iacute;, on the basis that we were in the Border region, with certain activity going on in Northern Ireland. Now we have eight garda&iacute; and a sergeant, though people who live in the area see little difference to the former situation, <Col N="1133"/>except that there has been an increase in aggravated robbery. They do not see the peace process making a great impact on certain types of crime. We see more criminality in the area than ever before and the people there cannot understand why Garda personnel numbers do not reflect the crime problems they experience.</P>
      <P>I have talked to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to the Garda Commissioner, to the Chief Superintendent, to superintendents, to local sergeants and garda&iacute;. I do not usually go straight to the top and I have been right around the block on this issue. Off the record, everyone agrees we do not have sufficient resources but when one asks a question officially, one is told that everyone has plenty of resources. The message from the people in my area is that they want Garda visibility. If those who tell us we have sufficient resources are correct, we want to see the garda&iacute; out on the beat, and if we do not have sufficient resources, we want more.</P>
      <P>I am not here to criticise the garda&iacute; in all respects because they catch many people breaking the law. When they catch such people and they are brought to court it is important that people feel confident about corroborating evidence. It is also important that sentences reflect the seriousness of the crimes. I know there is a separation between the State and the legal profession just as there is between church and State. However, I cannot talk about a criminal justice Bill without saying that we need to consider the sort of sentencing we currently see. It must be asked if certain penalties are appropriate for certain crimes. If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I am wrong, but if the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, then perhaps certain issues can be dealt with. I understand for example that the maximum fine that can be applied for anti-social behaviour offences is &euro;350. If a person is earning the sort of income currently earned by many people, that sum is not a deterrent, particularly for a second or repeat offence. A more serious issue, consistency of sentencing, must also be examined.</P>
      <P>I am living in an area with no 24-hour Garda station. The closest such station is in Buncrana, and the station there is badly in need of rebuilding. This should be done in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs which has a green-field site ready for use under the decentralisation programme. I hope the Minister will soon be in a position to announce the rebuilding of Buncrana Garda station because it is the obvious solution to a difficult problem. The situation whereby the only 24-hour Garda station in the area is in a run-down and dilapidated state does little for the morale of the Garda or of the people living there.</P>
      <P>In my area of the constituency there is no 24-hour Garda station. I am not concerned whether there is a 24-hour station or 24-hour cover because I do not want to simply see personnel <Col N="1134"/>sitting in Garda stations. The problem in Inishowen is that we formerly had eight 24-hour Garda stations and now have one such station, though there has been no difference in terms of Garda visibility. We need 24-hour Garda cover in north Inishowen, a matter I have previously raised with the Minister. The Garda Commissioner responded positively on this matter so I hope we will be hearing an announcement about cover in the area in the near future.</P>
      <P>The announcement of a Garda traffic corps may have been a response to the recent fatalities in the Inishowen area. This is another issue I have brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention. We have had the most tragic and awful 18 months in my immediate area in terms of losing young people in car crashes. I ask anybody to attend the number of houses of the bereaved that were visited in our area. Inishowen is not like other locations in that most of the 30,000 people living there are related to each other. When a car crash occurs on Inishowen, members of the community are sure to know the people involved. The past 18 months have been horrendous and any attempt to address our problems, including the traffic corps, are welcome.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The corps has only been in operation for two weeks but it is already producing results. This pilot project, which lasts a few months, is not a public relations exercise but is intended to resolve issues such as sufficient staffing and expansion. The existence of the corps is not in question.</P>
      <P>The majority of speed cameras seem to be located on national primary or secondary roads so they do not affect us because we do not possess such roads. This absence of national primary or secondary roads was the reason for the reduction of speed limits on all Donegal roads to the county road limit of 50 mph. That limit is not realistic on some roads which have hard shoulders and are straight enough to fulfil the criteria for a 60 mph speed limit. However, it will probably take a further 18 months to restore the 60 mph equivalent. Under these circumstances, members of the traffic corps can have lots of fun and fill the coffers with speeding fines by stopping soft targets who are travelling at 60 mph on roads where it is safe to do so.</P>
      <P>Joined up Government is needed. The Minister will probably tell me that the functions have been decentralised to the council and it is the latter&rsquo;s responsibility to fast track the matter. From the start, I did not believe that all speed limits should have been reduced from 60 mph to 50 mph but that councils should have responsibility for reducing speed limits on dangerous roads. However, I did not win that one.</P>
      <P>I often complain that people are penalised for driving at 35 mph in a 30 mph zone, while somebody passing at 90 mph is ignored. I hope the traffic corps will target people who drive dangerously or at extreme speeds rather than abuse the <Col N="1135"/>system. At present, the system does not work because of the blanket nature of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Education and driver training programmes are needed to prevent further road deaths. In Northern Ireland, a driver is automatically tested for alcohol if he or she hits a cyclist. There should be mandatory breath testing when a fatality is caused and possibly in cases of serious injury. While I am aware that constitutional issues arise in terms of the presumption of innocence, such a measure has merit and is not dissimilar to actions taken in other areas.</P>
      <P>Many crimes are linked to drug or alcohol use and much anti-social behaviour is conducted by people who are trying to feed habits or who are out of control. The Minister may claim that he is not responsible for rehabilitation centres, such as the White Oaks Centre in my constituency, because they fall within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. The problem is that, because they are nobody&rsquo;s responsibility, they do not receive recognition for their work. While not every person who drinks or takes drugs is involved with crime, many who commit crimes have problems with drugs or alcohol.</P>
      <P>Recently, I tabled a parliamentary question on fireworks to the Minister and received the reply that the matter is covered by the Explosives Act 1875 which is to be amended. I was interviewed on the radio this morning and was asked why the current legislation is not being enforced. Current sentencing and fines, however, are totally inappropriate. Fireworks are not used for display in my area but as missiles that are fired at cars and into fields containing cows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>If Operation Tombola was to follow me for a day, I would find a few fireworks. I am glad this issue is being addressed and, while some people make the case for an outright ban, the problem is that fireworks are currently banned but continue to be used. We need to decide which fireworks are safe. Some are more like mini-bombs than fireworks.</P>
      <P>As with any other aspect of criminal justice, enforcement is important but not sufficient. Other issues in terms of training, education and regulation also arise. The situation will not be addressed by focussing solely on enforcement. <Col N="1136"/>Fireworks are illegal but the law is not being sufficiently enforced.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to address the issue of funding for institutions that deal with domestic violence, although it may not be directly relevant to the Bill under discussion. Significant efforts are ongoing in my county to provide support in terms of drop-in centres and telephone helplines. Many of these operate through a part-time F&Aacute;S service. Difficulties arise in terms of funding because the centres are successful and greater numbers of people are contacting them. The centres&rsquo; efforts may be directed towards finding funding for the following year rather than concentrating on people who are seeking their help. The part-time nature of centres means that people are not available at certain times. It is important to deal with the victims of crime as well as the perpetrators. In terms of rehabilitation, the domestic violence support network should be addressed. There is a huge level of anti-social behaviour taking place. Such behaviour is manifested by the consumption of a large amount of alcohol, the taking of drugs, the use of fireworks or in other ways. I propose that discussion, if it has not already taken place, would take place across the relevant Departments to accept that there is a problem and to ascertain if it could be addressed by an interdepartmental approach. It is not a question of they adopting a big stick approach to addressing this problem. Some people who engaged in anti-social behaviour have been diverted from it by being encouraged to participate in sport, but not everyone is interested in sport. While we have excellent sporting facilities, particularly in the past eight or nine years, a youth officer-type person might not be available to co-ordinate such activity. It is as much the role of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as any other Department to address the needs in this area. If we are trying to keep such people out of prison by encouraging them to become involved in activity that is constructive, the needs in that area need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>As to the notion that all such offenders should come under the juvenile liaison officer system, some offenders are frightened by it and the system works in their case, but other offenders have no fear of it and it does not work in their case. The JLO system needs to be reviewed in terms of dealing with hardened criminals who need to be dealt with in a particular way. Alternatively, in the case of offenders who are not hardened criminals, imaginative initiatives need to be explored. In that context, I envisage a role for the arts as much as for sport and education in the development of diversionary projects. I would like to think the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would discuss with the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Sport the possibility of funding being made available to assist offenders to be diverted to participate in arts projects, either in <Col N="1137"/>the visual arts or in music, composition or other such activities.</P>
      <P>Another issue, which I tried but was unable to raise by way of parliamentary question to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, relates to a recent series of bomb threats in my constituency in respect of which there was a difficulty in tracing the mobile phone used. It can be difficult to trace the ownership of pay as you go mobile telephones. I raised the lack of registration of ownership of such phones with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources when he was dealing with the issue of safety in terms of minors using mobile phones. From the perspective of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there is a security issue regarding the use and tracing of the ownership of such phones. It is a matter the Minister present could raise with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>When one purchases a pay as you go mobile phone in the North, one must produce a utility bill or other documentation to prove one&rsquo;s identify while in the South all one need give is one&rsquo;s name and one could cite any name. There is no requirement to show proof of one&rsquo;s identity. If such a phone is used in criminal activity, it is probably possible to trace the owner of the phone but the process is much slower than if a registration system were in place. That issue has cropped up of late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to require 11 year olds to show a gas or ESB bill when they purchase a mobile phone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In their case parents could be required to produce such a bill. There must be some mechanism put in place to meet this requirement. In many cases parents give their children the money to buy a mobile phone. Some form of identification needs to be produced because the other side of the coin is their dangerous use in criminal activity. Considerable manpower hours have to be devoted to tracing the owners of mobile phones. Sometimes the authorities get hoax calls but many such calls are not in that category. Therefore, the mechanism I propose is valid.</P>
      <P>I also draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the Buncrana Garda station in terms of it being open 24 hours a day and having adequate Garda resources. He knows my view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of this Bill which has come to us in stages, so to speak, with a further parcel of amendments to be introduced on later Stages. Its primary purpose is to enhance the power of the garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences by the provision of additional anti-crime measures. It outlines a comprehensive <Col N="1138"/>set of measures including increased detention powers, crime scene preservation, firearms assurances, fixed penalties for lesser offences, electronic tagging, DNA data banks and enhanced Garda powers. Mandatory minimum sentences are also proposed for certain firearms offences, including the modification of firearms such as sawn-off shotguns. That is necessary because firearms, including shotguns, and robbers seem to go hand in hand. Deputies Keaveney and Crawford, representing Border areas, spoke about local shops in their areas being targeted and robbed. One of the undesirable by-products of the peace process is that people believe there is less observation in place and these criminals can travel to and from the two jurisdictions. That is one of the sad situations that has developed.</P>
      <P>A shop in my neighbourhood has been robbed three times in three weeks at various times, perhaps at 9 a.m. on a Sunday when the owners were setting up the shop or at lunch time. These crimes are usually committed in daylight and initially, in the instance to which I referred, the robbers did not wear balaclavas. That is the type of activity that is going on. When push comes to shove, the garda&iacute; know who has carried out these crimes. In one case they know it is individuals from Cookstown, County Tyrone. What level of co-operation do we have or what do we need to apprehend these people? One necessary requirement is good quality video evidence of these people, and we know who they are. It is a farce that we cannot take these people off the streets. These crimes have occurred regularly and the perpetrators believe they can continue to do this with impunity.</P>
      <P>I am aware these crimes have driven some victims to distraction. They feel they are forced to sell their shops or whatever and that they have been devalued. If they go away for a weekend and put a member of staff in charge of the shop, they believe they are putting that person&rsquo;s life at risk. I talked to one individual who told me he was a coward but that he felt like getting a shotgun and going after these people. They have been driven to that. Unless garda&iacute; are assigned to deal with these individuals committing these crimes on a one to one basis, so to speak, addressing the problem will be very difficult. However, when we have got to the point where the individuals are known, there must be some way of dealing with them. That is a major difficulty.</P>
      <P>Tougher sentences have been promised for drug dealers as well as traffickers and for firearms offences. These include sentences of up to life imprisonment for a person convicted of importing large consignments of drugs. What is the definition of a large consignment of drugs? Is it a sufficient amount for a dealer, or for two people? How large must the consignment be? There is no doubt those who sell drugs are vermin in our society. In the country we used to be of the view <Col N="1139"/>that drug dealing only occurred in certain areas of cities but every drug dealer must get money from somewhere to expand his or her empire. The problem of drug dealing has expanded to every village and town in country areas. We hear of seizures being made in country areas and so on and it is vital that this problem be dealt with urgently.</P>
      <P>The problem of drug offences in respect of prisons, supplying, attempts to smuggle drugs into prisons and possession in the vicinity of prisons are addressed in the Bill. People used to be put in prison to take them away from mischief but there is anecdotal evidence from different programmes and from people who have been released from prison that they can get drugs in prison. Perhaps a small percentage want to get their lives in order when they are given the shock of a prison sentence but they discover that there is a culture of drug taking in prison. We must address the problem of the suppliers and people who circumvent ways of getting drugs into prison. That is the nub of the problem and we must find a way of dealing with that problem.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Persons on the periphery of drug smuggling, better known as mules, will be enabled to apply to the court to have information in terms of assisting garda&iacute; heard <i>in camera</i>. That is vital because while these mules are involved in illicit activity, they are basically driven by money. We could get a good deal of valuable information from them, which would give us information on who is selling drugs. We need to encourage key people to co-operate, people who know the drug pushers, those who are giving them money and who have given them contacts. The concept of life for the big guys in the drugs business is to remain free and not to be caught in possession. They do not mind the mule being caught in possession but when the mule is caught we should realise he or she is a mule, and move to offer some sort of anonymity through the court. That would pay dividends.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Like the penalty points system this raft of measures will prove pointless without vastly increased resources to ensure enforcement of what, at first glance, appears to be a shot in the arm for crime prevention. It should be taken as a given, having been recognised in the programme for Government that there was a need for an additional 2,000 extra garda&iacute;, that would form part of any comprehensive package to tackle the crime rates. It is absolutely necessary to get the extra garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>The ASBO phenomenon has been imported from Britain where the implications have ranged from the ridiculous to the draconian. I have heard ASBOs described as a type of esoteric injunction that bans people from highly specific acts that fall just this side of criminality. Many citizens demand that politicians consider imposing sanctions on <Col N="1140"/>behaviour that has hitherto been considered annoying but not criminal. It is just bordering on the criminal. The tragedy is that many young people realise they are underage and know they cannot be arrested. To some extend parents are almost goading the children and not taking them in and correcting them. We cannot ignore these issues but whether ASBOs is the correct route they got much negative publicity.</P>
      <P>Buzz words such as &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;weapons of mass destruction&rdquo; come to mind. There is no doubt that anti-social behaviour does exist but the way to tackle is to hit its root causes. That has been mentioned here on a number of occasions. This would entail the provision of adequate sport and leisure facilities locally, together with excellent properly funded high quality educational facilities. We all acknowledge this is the way around the issue. Does one introduce an order and say this is what will be done when one misbehaves or put in a distraction which improves the behaviour? This will do more to tackle youth crime and anti-social behaviour than the knee-jerk reactions embodied in some ASBOs that descend to the farcical, such as the banning of clothing accessories, baseball caps and hoodies. Because of the way the media has driven it, if I see a hoodie I wonder what the guy is up to. I tend to forget this is a style or an accessory.</P>
      <P>Rebuilding a spirit of basic solidarity in our communities is also essential. Young criminals invariably feel alienated from everyone around them, and see crime as the easiest way of expressing a backlash against alienation. In the UK, ASBOs can be served on any person over ten years of age. They were introduced in 1999 primarily to deal with the phenomenon of neighbours from hell. The guideline for their use has been extended to cover graffiti, under-age drinking and smoking. The recipient of an ASBO does not have to be present in court but hearsay evidence is enough to have him or her convicted and often it is the only evidence available.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There also has been the instances of dress codes against jeans in schools and the efforts to ban the veil in the case of Muslims in France. Some of us can remember the time when jeans and runners were banned in dance halls, or we may have read about the ban.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State was probably too young to remember. Also people who spit and swear and play loud music and wearers of skimpy clothing have been the subjects of ASBOs imposed by the courts. I do not know if courts have a role in terms of the attire people wear. There has been an increasing tendency to ban people from doing precisely the kind of things people used to do while saying, &ldquo;it is a free <Col N="1141"/>country&rdquo;. Some of the laws we are attempting to introduce can lead to accusations of the State becoming a nanny State. We have got to be careful of that. It reinforces the notion that we are being intrusive and so on.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are many excellent youth programmes in Ireland which seek to deal with the underlying causes of anti-social behaviour. However, they are invariably grossly underfunded and, therefore, unable to achieve their full potential. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government should tackle the root causes of anti-social behaviour and deal with non-criminal behaviour exclusively through non-criminalising methods. They should tackle the fact that many communities have minimal or no play and recreational facilities for children. Some 46% of local authorities do not provide playgrounds. An interesting statistic is that Ireland has twice as many golf courses as play grounds. I am a member of a golf club and every time there is a price increase there is pressure on people to leave those facilities. Even in the well-heeled K Club when there was talk of increasing the fees there was a suggestion that it might have to go back to being a playground.</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate funding is causing youth clubs to close, with thousands of young people deprived of outlets in which they could be gainfully occupied. We have one of the highest rates of child poverty in Ireland where one in seven children has been described as living in abject or consistent poverty. This shows we should provide for these people.</P>
      <P>Among the amendments introduced by the Minister is a proposal for electronic tagging of offenders. Electronic tagging has enjoyed a phenomenal rate of success, particularly in the US and the UK, with a 2% to 3% rate of re-offending. In the fight against anti-social behaviour and crime, it has proven to be extremely effective but the circumstances of its use are somewhat obscure.</P>
      <P>At its annual conference a few years ago the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors pointed to the excellent results being achieved with electronic tagging in other countries. The president of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors called for the use of electronic tagging to protect the public from dangerous offenders such as convicted sex offenders. The conference also suggested the tagging of serious offenders on early release, thereby protecting potential victims while monitoring those on release until their time was up. The representative groups say these are successful. The cost of keeping an offender in jail for one year is &euro;55,000 while a tagging device at a cost &euro;4,000 would have paid for itself in a period of four weeks. Given the value for money and the fact there will be no re-offending this deserves consideration.</P><Col N="1142"/>
      <P>Given the high level of success achieved elsewhere, it would be eminently feasible to use tagging in the case of first-time offenders, thereby easing pressure on over-crowded prisons. A spell in prison is a stain on the record of a young first-time offender and is frequently the prelude to a life of crime. If tagging was instrumental in the rehabilitation of such offenders, enabling them to stay out of prison and be integrated with their community, its success would be compounded.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I note the Minister stated it was his intention to draw up proposals to provide for the establishment of a DNA databank. This is a bank in which most of us would not wish to have an account but that does not mean there are no dividends. It would certainly prove to be an asset in helping to solve hundreds of crimes each year. A suspect is not necessarily always guilty. The fact that DNA taken from suspects detained would be available could help prove their innocence if the courts relied on DNA evidence. Given that DNA cannot be replicated, al-Qaeda would have a major problem with it. The power of DNA is indisputable. Its reputation for accuracy has become so widespread that many juries are reluctant to convict without DNA evidence. The development of as extensive a databank as possible would have to have regard to the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights and also the Constitution. As yet we do not have a national criminal DNA databank while the criminal fraternity can avail and make use of all the latest developments in technology. A strong and effective DNA databank would be of tremendous benefit to the criminal justice system. Not alone would it assist the Garda in identifying persons who have committed crimes but it would also serve to exclude innocent persons who have been wrongly convicted.</P>
      <P>The DNA databank would have a number of purposes including the deterrence of potential repeat offenders &mdash; if it succeeded in that objective it would be a massive achievement; the promotion of the safety of the community; the detection of when a serial offender is operating; assistance in solving old and cold cases; streamlining investigations and exonerating those wrongfully convicted. It is clear from evidence in other jurisdictions that the more profiles included in a DNA databank, the more effective it is. DNA evidence has an immense effect on the criminal justice system with the real potential for the reduction of miscarriages of justice.</P>
      <P>It is important to achieve an appropriate balance in weighing the competing interests of the security of the person, the privacy of the individual and the public interest in compiling a strong and effective DNA databank. It has also been suggested that DNA testing might make the transition from solving crimes to deterring them. If it helps in this regard it would be excellent.</P><Col N="1143"/>
      <P>Earlier in the debate reference was made to fireworks. This issue raises its head regularly in a Border constituency like mine. Some shops in Northern Ireland sell the proper kite-marked fireworks but a customer must have a licence to purchase them. It is like buying ammunition for a sporting gun; the licence must be produced and note taken of to whom the fireworks are sold. However, people are getting around the regulations and they obviously have sources where they can buy their fireworks. They can then set up shop on the side of the road in Northern Ireland. When travelling from my home to Dundalk or Cavan, it is necessary to pass through concession routes. These people seem to be allowed to operate in this way in Northern Ireland. If we have co-operation between police forces why is nothing being done about this matter? Do the authorities in Northern Ireland know that because the fireworks are being bought by people from the South it will not affect them? Each year at Hallowe&rsquo;en time we hear of the damage that unregulated fireworks can do. I could drive into Northern Ireland and fill my car with fireworks. I am sure that carloads of them are coming to the South. We have no way to deal with the issue. They sell the products on concession routes or other strategic locations in Northern Ireland. We should raise this matter with our colleagues in the context of cross-Border meetings. Even if I went into a regular shop and the shopkeeper guessed I was from the South, I would have no difficulty buying them. This area needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Section 11(1) will empower the Garda to photograph all persons arrested even if they are subsequently released. Some Garda arrests will be made in error and in such cases the photograph and its negative should be destroyed. While Garda powers should be extended we need to be careful about how they might be misused. We have seen Garda powers misused in the past and we want to avoid a recurrence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was here earlier but regrettably he has now gone.</P>
      <P>The way the Minister operates is called into question by the manner in which this Bill has been introduced. I have heard the Minister on many occasions and have enjoyed what might be called his colourful style. He describes himself as many things. I have heard him describe himself as a republican and as a liberal. I presume he would describe himself as an arch-capitalist, as the rest of the country would. The first two labels interest me most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>He is definitely not a socialist.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1144"/>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe he is a socialist. I do not believe he would go along with the Taoiseach in that matter. However, anything could happen. I see his party colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, is now concerned about community values. As such radical shifts in interests can occur perhaps he will become a socialist in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Or perhaps even an environmentalist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe he is a fraud particularly when he claims to be a liberal of the great enlightenment tradition. I would consider myself a liberal. A liberal believes the State should not be involved in the nitty-gritty of people&rsquo;s business. We should set a light hand to the legislative process to maintain freedom as the enlightenment tradition behoves us to do. We should recognise the respect it gives to citizens as free and equal in a republican democracy under the law.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a liberal, what is he doing? Deputy Costello can confirm that in his three years in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform he has dealt with approximately 35 Bills. A Chinese mandarin would be proud of the rate at which he is throwing out legislation. I note he speaks mandarin Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition always seeks activity and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the greatest reforming Minister in the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is certainly reforming. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is making my point. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot produce enough legislation. He cannot make it wide-reaching enough. He is so keen to legislate, as a liberal, that on Report Stage of a previous Bill this year he introduced entirely new surveillance legislation at the last minute on Report Stage. He is certainly busy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill we are discussing was published in 2004 within the time the Minister was in office. It deals with many sensible measures regarding how we treat crime scenes, etc., which are not contentious. However, as we debate Second Stage we are told the Minister will introduce a huge number of amendments. A genuine liberal concerned about the preservation of the value of all being equal before the law could not describe this Bill as liberal.</P>
      <P>I have deep concerns about the move towards mandatory sentences regardless of the crime committed. This provision does not come from the liberal tradition that I supposedly share with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not believe that the criminalisation of people, even if they are members of a gang or whatever, <Col N="1145"/>goes in the direction of the liberal republican tradition in which we treat people as innocent until proved guilty as opposed to criminals by association.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about extending periods of detention to 24 hours, something I regard as highly illiberal. It is difficult to debate the matter at this stage because we do not know what the Minister will propose. He is throwing it up in the air to get media coverage and notoriety. He wants to be seen proudly as the bull in the china shop, recklessly but happily willing to say the bold thing. A liberal would not legislate in that manner and the Minister of State should not snigger at legislating in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order with his description. He does not need to court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am perfectly accurate in my description of the Minister as a fraud in the way he has introduced this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Central to any liberal republican democracy is the need for the courts and the police to apply the rules of a civilised ordered society. If the Government is genuinely concerned about progressing those institutions, protecting them and giving them respect, certain planning and legislative processes should be followed. The Government should engage sections of society in proper planning and discussion of legislative proposals. A Green Paper and White Paper should be produced on these complex and controversial legal issues. Then possibly one brings them to the Second Stage debate for discussion but one does not insert them at the very last minute, in a sweeping change to some of the fundamental principles of our judicial and policing systems. That is a reckless and illiberal approach to legislative change.</P>
      <P>The issue of policing is of major concern. At this time there are concerns about the way in which evidence has been collected in west Cork with regard to certain murder inquiries. There is concern in Donegal regarding the way in which certain detentions and arrests were carried out. Only yesterday concerns were expressed throughout the country about the absolute absence of records in Garda stations relating to very serious crimes perpetrated against children in Ferns. The Minister has a duty to address the incredible loss of faith in our police force which was, up until very recently, viewed with such respect and held in such high regard by citizens. Rather than throw legislation around, left and right, like confetti, he should address that real loss of confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>Whenever I think of our police force, I return to that simple, but powerful statement by the first <Col N="1146"/>Garda Commissioner, Mr. Michael Staines, who said, &ldquo;The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will succeed, not by force of arms or numbers, but by their moral authority as servants of the people&rdquo;. The Minister should base his agenda on the police force on that simple principle. There is a real concern about trying to give the police authority, not by arms, but by a whole array of legislative measures and powers. Such measures include increased 24 hour detention rights before an arrest has to be made, the removal of the requirement for a warrant from a judge in order to search a property and ASBOs, which are being considered here. Rather than providing the police with authority by such widespread and potentially dangerous measures, which could be thwarted or used in an improper way, the Minister should start working from the ground up in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He should examine the training, the control system, in terms of the Garda ombudsman and the structures of the force. We need to move towards a system of community garda&iacute;, who are linked closely with local authorities and communities, so they are not just dealing with the issue of social disorder, which is of real concern to people, on a reactionary basis and as a sideline to their main duties, but as the core of their duties.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is seriously interested in addressing the social concerns that exist in our society, he must undertake genuine root and branch reform of the way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works, the thinking within the force and the way that it is controlled rather than throwing legislation at the issue, giving the Garda sweeping powers, which goes against the judicial tradition and what can be truly described as a proper, liberal judicial system.</P>
      <P>With regard to children, there is one issue that stands out as being of particular concern, although it is impossible to know the real position because the Minister has not bothered to insert the provision into the legislation yet, so we are arguing in the dark, to some degree. The issue is the potential criminalisation of young people under the anti-social behaviour orders system. This is a remarkable example of the lack of a proper legislative process. The Minister, no doubt, will refer to the experience in the United Kingdom. However, the United Kingdom went about this process in the proper manner, in terms of putting in place judicial changes in other areas, such as the courts system, the policing system and so on, before engaging in detailed planning and investigation with regard to how ASBOs might be introduced.</P>
      <P>I suspect there is not a single person on either side of this House who knew the Minister was coming up with the ASBOs idea. I believe he came upon it one night, perhaps around 3 a.m., and decided that it would rattle the cages and receive a fair amount of political support and that he would be seen as a courageous, pioneering <Col N="1147"/>Minister. I do not think a single member of Fianna F&aacute;il or the Progressive Democrats knew what he was up to. Certainly, there was no consultation beyond those boundaries. Perhaps the Progressive Democrats sat down in a huddle and came up with it as a bright spark idea but nobody else did. For these proposals to then appear in the Minister&rsquo;s speech on Second Stage as something he intends to introduce on Third Stage is a remarkable and disgraceful example of the illiberal, fraudulent style of legislative process in which this Minister is engaged.</P>
      <P>If we are to treat this issue seriously, as many others including Deputies Andrews, Carey and Higgins have said, we should be treating the legislation we have already passed, namely, the Children Act 2001, seriously. That point also came out yesterday in the remarkable litany of incidences of blind indifference by the State towards the welfare and upbringing of children. Then Members come to this House and express concern that some children are acting in an anti-social manner that is of concern to others. If we wish to address that problem then, rather than throwing platitudes at it, we must run our society on the basis that we get the early years&rsquo; rearing of our children right and provide children with a supportive background. That requires fundamental and radical changes in a wide variety of areas. I suggest that the Progressive Democrats contribution to that process, in terms of its children&rsquo;s policy, is that whatever is good for the business community is good for children. The Progressive Democrats want to get everyone into the workplace and to plan children&rsquo;s futures around that priority. That is something that must be changed if we want to change the behaviour of children, subsequent to such policies.</P>
      <P>We should also change our planning laws. We are seeing the &ldquo;PD-ification&rdquo; of our society in planning terms &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy suggesting that jobs are not important? A job is the most important aspect of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would describe the &ldquo;PD-ification&rdquo; of our society as the electronic, closed-gate society we are developing. One comes along to a closed community, supposedly designed to give greater security, and one has to press a button before one can enter. Those inside may think they are living in a much more secure society. That personifies the situation to me. When I approach such buttons, I think to myself, this is a Progressive Democrats first preference household.</P>
      <P>The safer and better way to bring order and coherence to our society is to start planning integrated communities properly, where people look out for each other. Simply planning, as this <Col N="1148"/>Government does, for the interests of builders and developers, and then tagging on social order legislation afterwards is not the way to go. Yet the T&aacute;naiste has expressed surprise at the fact that the way society has been developed has broken up social capital and led to a lessened sense of community. We should start from the first principles of society, getting the planning right, designing a cohesive, collective society. This revolves around the types of decisions made in education and child care, in choosing public transport over the private car and so on. Bad decisions trigger a divided, unequal and unfair society and it cannot be surprising if this leads to anti-social behaviour or other negative reactions. The answer is not to slap on further punitive legislation on young people, but to recognise that the Government has got the fundamental design of society wrong. That is why the Government needs to be changed, to be thrown out of office.</P>
      <P>I look forward to seeing the contents of this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is important legislation. The issues of criminal justice, criminality and protection for citizens are of major concern. There is considerable debate raging in communities with regard to the safety of citizens. However, we must balance the safety of citizens with the rights of citizens.</P>
      <P>The place where we discuss the rights of citizens, where we enact legislation, where the representatives of the people can voice their concerns to the Executive is here, in this Chamber. I am concerned that what is before us is only half a Bill. We have yet to see the other half, which we are told will be introduced, possibly on Committee Stage. This is very serious and dangerous. I would be much happier if we had the full legislative proposals before us today, in Bill form, so we could discuss them in this Chamber, which is the parliament of our country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the steering group on the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy was published in June of this year. The report was the culmination of a comprehensive review, which was launched last year and which included extensive public consultations. The review was overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department, and comprised representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. Assistance was provided by external consultants. The review sought to assess the impact and direction of the strategy at its mid-point and the steering group concentrated on identifying beneficial adjustments to the strategy and highlighting priorities for the second phase up to 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the drugs strategy are fundamentally sound. It was confirmed there have been encouraging signs of progress since 2001, when the strategy was first launched, sug<Col N="1152"/>gesting that our current approach to tackling the drug problem is effective. At the same time, however, the review highlights the need to re-focus priorities and accelerate the roll-out and implementation of various key actions in the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008. In this context, a number of new actions, and amendments to others, have been identified. These changes will strengthen the strategy and enable it to better deliver its aims. Overall, ten of the strategy&rsquo;s 100 actions are being replaced, a further seven are being amended and eight new actions are being taken to address issues such as family support and rehabilitation. With regard to progress, the review found that 49 of the original 100 actions outlined in the strategy are completed or are ongoing, progress was ongoing on a further 45 and considerable progress has still to be made on six actions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding to tackle drug misuse is channelled through a number of relevant Departments and agencies. In this regard, I have responsibility for funding the work of the local and regional drugs task forces, the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund and the national advisory committee on drugs. In 2005, I secured an 18% increase on the 2004 allocation and the funds available this year for these activities amount to &euro;31.5 million. Since 1997, the Government has allocated just under &euro;200 million to fund this work. These amounts are in addition to the significant spending of other Departments and agencies, such as the Health Service Executive, the Garda and F&Aacute;S, in tackling the issue of drug misuse. All these bodies agreed to deliver a number of actions under the national drugs strategy. In this regard, I am confident that, as the strategy progresses, resources will be made available to implement the actions agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree the strategy needs to be much more proactive in addressing the increasing cocaine problem? Between 1995 and 2004 cocaine worth &euro;537 million was seized. Based on international norms, ten times that amount probably reached the streets. The average weekly use of cocaine in Ireland is 3 grams and chronic addicts use between 5 and 10 grams. The price of cocaine has reduced significantly and it costs between &euro;30 and &euro;40 per 0.5 gram, which means that average users spend between &euro;180 and &euro;240 per week and chronic users spend between &euro;300 and &euro;600 per week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cocaine use among males increased from 1.8% in 2001 to 3% in 2003, which is a worrying statistic, while 5.1% of those in the 18 to 24 year group use cocaine. Cocaine use peaked in the US in the 1990s at 25 million users and 2 million addicts while it is peaking in the UK now. There are grave concerns in the UK that the number of strokes and heart attacks among young people as <Col N="1153"/>a result of severe addictions will increase. All the indications are that Ireland is experiencing an increasing problem on a horrendous scale and I remain to be convinced that the national drugs strategy is proactive enough to deal with this major problem, which is potentially worse than the heroin problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that when the drugs problem emerged, the drugs strategy was developed and the task forces were set up, the focus was on heroin in disadvantaged areas of Dublin. Cocaine has always been used but the drug was inclined to be used by the more professional classes. However, as the Deputy said, the price of cocaine has reduced significantly and the use of the drug is the major problem now. It is used by all age groups from teenagers upwards. However, the strategy is flexible enough to adapt and address new problems.</P>
        <P>Despite everything that is said about heroin, methadone is a substitute treatment and one of the major problems in addressing cocaine use is the lack of an equivalent substitute treatment. The best we can offer addicts who come forward, which is a problem in itself, is counselling and behavioural therapy. Heroin has a bad image, even among users, whereas cocaine is perceived as a clean, harmless drug because it is used by film stars and others, even though it is nothing of the sort. We face a major battle against that perception. Awareness campaigns are run but it is difficult to get through to people the damage they are doing to themselves because it is not obvious in the short term.</P>
        <P>A number of cocaine initiatives were approved this time last year. Approximately 600 staff on various drugs projects are funded and many of them have received upskilling and retraining this year to enable them to help people with a cocaine addiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published a report on cocaine addiction recently. Addiction in the UK is increasing because there is greater acceptability of the use of cocaine and, similar to Ireland, the price has reduced. Our report found that younger people felt that cocaine helped sporting performance and the drug was acceptable. Should local and regional task forces focus on these issues? A focussed campaign is needed to disabuse people of the view that cocaine use is acceptable and it enhances sporting prowess.</P>
        <P>Whereas a substitute therapy for cocaine use similar to that used to treat heroin addicts is not available, methods can be adopted through which cocaine addicts can be treated through the psychiatric services and so on. The task forces need to focus on this and they must realise how great a problem cocaine use is becoming. Almost &euro;500 <Col N="1154"/>million per annum was spent between 1995 and 2004 on the drug in this State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with most of the Deputy&rsquo;s comments and I accept cocaine use is a major problem. The task forces and the national drugs strategy team are trying to make people aware of the dangers of cocaine use. The Department of Health and Children runs awareness campaigns, including a cocaine specific campaign. Cocaine is a dangerous substance with significant side effects, particularly heart failure and lung damage and mixed with alcohol, it can cause severe psychological problems and generate aggressive behaviour. We are trying to make people aware of that although it is not easy because one is fighting against an image perceived to be glamorous. There has been an example of this in the media recently. Much of the damage to individuals is not immediately or swiftly evident. Some users&rsquo; problems may build up over time and they may not be aware of them.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report 2004 on the wrongful procedures followed in the introduction of the rural social scheme.</Quest>
        <QRef>[30779/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, &euro;10 million was paid from the dormant accounts fund into a suspense account operated by my Department to meet the expenses of the rural social scheme in line with the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech 2004. During 2004, almost &euro;3.4 million was paid to participants in the rural social scheme from the suspense account.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention in section 8.1 of his annual report to the suspense account mechanism which was used, as directed by the Department of Finance, for payments under the rural social scheme as being not, strictly speaking, the legally correct way of channelling the money to the beneficiaries of the rural social scheme.</P>
        <P>The matter at issue relates specifically to the mechanism for channelling the funding and not to the probity of the payments. The Comptroller and Auditor General states that the Department of Finance has conceded that on reflection it would have been better to have channelled the funding through the Vote. Apart from this procedural issue, the Comptroller and Auditor General has certified that the 2004 appropriation account for Vote 27 of my Department properly presents the receipts and expenditure of the Vote.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, following the recent enactment of the Dormant Accounts <Col N="1155"/>(Amendment) Act 2005, it is intended that the full amount of funding for the rural social scheme in 2005 will be channelled through my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has reiterated a section of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and has posited the defence that this is a procedural matter. The matter is one of the smallest references in the report but the three paragraphs dealing with it raise other questions. Does the use of this mechanism indicate that the rural and social scheme was thought up quite quickly in advance of the budget? After the Budget Statement in December 2004 a mechanism had to be found to pay for the scheme. This much is glaringly obvious from the brief references in the report.</P>
        <P>The sum of &euro;10 million paid from the dormant accounts fund under the old mechanism before the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act was introduced in 2005 indicates an inappropriate use of that money. Such money should be used for voluntary organisations in the whole yet the Minister chose to fund a scheme announced in the budget that should have been funded from general Exchequer funding. Has the original &euro;10 million taken from the fund been reimbursed? Will the continuing funding mechanism for the rural social scheme come from the Department&rsquo;s Estimate? Will he continue using the dormant accounts fund to fund the rural social scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy raised a number of questions I will attempt to answer within the time limits. The rural social scheme was included in the programme for Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto for the last election. The scheme was announced in the budget and when one announces a scheme mechanisms must be found. The Department of Finance directed that the money be paid through a suspense account and that issue has been dealt with and the money will be included in the Vote.</P>
        <P>The money from the dormant accounts funds must be used for different headings, including social and economic disadvantage. No reference is made to an obligation to grant it to voluntary bodies. The sum of &euro;10 million allocated from the dormant accounts fund was properly authorised, consistent with the provisions of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, which, in section 41(1)(<i>a</i>) details programmes or projects that are designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability within the meaning of the Equal Status Act 2000. Section 41(1)(<i>b</i>) provides that the Minister, in consultation with the board, may from time to time specify programmes that are consistent with the requirements of section <Col N="1156"/>41(1)(<i>a</i>). I consulted the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board in accordance with the relevant legislation and following that consultation the board released &euro;10 million for the rural social scheme.</P>
        <P>The entire sum of &euro;10 million has been properly and solely spent in the rural and social scheme. The matter raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, whether it should have been channelled through the Vote in a Supplementary Estimate or through a suspense account, is purely procedural. From now on this will be done through a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister is aware the Comptroller and Auditor General is precluded by law from speaking on policy. The question I raise relates solely to policy. The use of the dormant accounts fund for initial funding of the rural social scheme was inappropriate. General funding from the Department&rsquo;s Estimate should have been used. I have asked if this money will be reimbursed and if the future funding mechanism will be channelled through the dormant accounts fund or through Department&rsquo;s general Estimate.</P>
        <P>In debates on the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act, many of us expressed fears the Minister would be the chief allocator of funds. This is reinforced by the decision that the Minister is the chief decision maker on how money is allocated. On the whim of the Minister, or any subsequent Minister, money could be allocated to a pet project in one area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It never ceases to amaze me how one can have a translation of an Act imposed as a justification of a criticism of a subsequent Act. This was done under the 2001 Act and the powers already existed. What Deputy Boyle objects to in the 2003 Act was already present in the 2001 Act, which he does not criticise. This was done under the 2001 Act. It is within the power of the Minister under the 2001 Act as long as procedure is followed.</P>
        <P>There is no question of repaying the disbursed money as we will not approach the people in the rural social scheme asking them to reimburse money so we can give it back to the dormant accounts fund. The money was spent on social and economic disadvantage. The power to do so was included in the 2001 Act. The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the procedure, which we have now corrected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will this happen for future funding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Future funding will be the same mix, partly from the Exchequer and partly from the dormant accounts fund. That is the way in which the scheme has been set up. If Deputy Boyle thinks the rural social scheme is not a good idea and that it does not help social disadvantage, <Col N="1157"/>perhaps this reflects Green Party policy. This is an effective way of dealing with social disadvantage of people in rural communities, such as low income farmers and their families. It is an appropriate use of funds from the dormant accounts. Obviously, the Green Party has a different policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of the Minister&rsquo;s policy is to dilute the fund for other purposes. I could argue the Minister&rsquo;s policy opposes giving further funding to voluntary groups because that is its effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The dormant accounts fund has no specific remit for voluntary groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a limited fund and the more it is used the less remains. That is the effect of the Minister&rsquo;s policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The more one disburses the fund, the less money there is in the fund, that is true irrespective of the beneficiaries of the money. In Government, one must make choices on priorities. We consider this one of the most effective ways of dealing with social and economic deprivation in rural areas, ahead of some of the other choices. It was a priority to distribute funding to this area and we stand by our choice. Deputy Boyle does not rate this as a priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Minister&rsquo;s job to get more money from the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that the body concerned is making good progress on the work entrusted to it. As the Deputy is aware, there was an independent investigation into allegations of bullying and harassment and related matters in the body and actions to be taken arising from the report of the investigators were agreed with the CEO. Action on these is under way and progress is being monitored.</P>
        <P>The failure to spend capital funds arose for reasons outside the control of the body itself and I am satisfied that the circumstances that led to delays in a number of key projects are now resolved. As the Deputy is aware, in the event of <Col N="1158"/>an underspend under any heading, the money is either reallocated to other projects within the Vote or surrendered to the Exchequer. In the case of deferral, a further provision is re-entered in the Vote the following year.</P>
        <P>I should mention that I met recently with the CEO of the body to review progress in 2005 and discuss priorities for 2006. In this context, I am pleased to again acknowledge the work of the CEO and his staff in advancing the work of the body, often in challenging and complex circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to give a more comprehensive answer to his question on a &lsquo;details supplied&rsquo; basis, but I will be happy to address any further specific questions he may wish to raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister will agree this is an important organisation, established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, which has an important cross-Border dimension. I am sure he will agree also, as he more or less stated in his reply, that this organisation has had a turbulent existence since it was established a number of years ago. Recent difficulties within the organisation include auditing problems identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2000, 2001 and 2002, and accusations of bullying, referred to by the Minister, which were upheld following an independent investigation, with the result that the staff are now undergoing anti-bullying training. There was also a recommendation that more transparent methods of recruitment would be employed by the body and that all vacancies should be filled in the normal way in such bodies, namely, by open competition. That practice was not always adhered to. The body knew since September that &euro;12 million in unspent moneys was returned to the Government in 2003 and 2004. No one doubts this organisation is founded on worthwhile principles and aims but the question must be asked whether it is achieving these aims. The evidence suggests it is not operating at its most functional. The knock-on effect is a failure to achieve its objectives and the potential that up to &euro;30 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money could be wasted. Will the Minister agree that in view of these difficulties in recent years it may be timely to review the operations of this body and its efficiencies in achieving its objectives?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="1159"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is of assistance in giving the Deputy a full answer. I would like to deal with a number of issues. Actions are to be taken on foot of the findings of the investigators and as the Deputy said, further courses on bullying are being arranged for all members of staff, including the CEO, building on the considerable work that has been carried out in Waterways Ireland over the past two years to put in place appropriate mechanisms for dealing with bullying and harassment in the workplace, with practically all staff now having been trained.</P>
        <P>A full independent review of practices and policies relating to bullying in the organisation will be carried out at an early date. The review will include an audit of the current processes and training programmes in Waterways Ireland in regard to bullying and the possible setting up of an independent mechanism to support staff making complaints. The report will be made available to the Department. Those issues, therefore, are being dealt with.</P>
        <P>On the third aspect the Deputy raised, the CEO will personally ensure that a written policy on recruitment and promotions based on best practice principles, including fairness and transparency, will be prepared and circulated to all staff in Waterways Ireland and that best public sector practice will be followed in future appointments and promotions within Waterways Ireland.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal with the money issue because for a number of reasons it is not as simple as it appears. The first issue that arises is that the organisation was to build a headquarters in Enniskillen as well as two regional offices. The one in Scariff is already under construction and it is hoped to start building the headquarters in Enniskillen next year.</P>
        <P>In terms of what happened, a number of years ago a capital provision was made for Waterways Ireland for these buildings. I do not have the exact figure here but if, say, &euro;3 million or whatever was put into the funding in one year and it was not spent, that funding would be put back in a second year and, if not spent, the same amount of money would be put in a third year. People were talking about money going back to the Department but it is the same money allocated three times for the same purpose. It would be like the Deputy putting aside &euro;30,000 to build an addition to his house, not getting around to doing it, leaving it the following year but doing it the third year. He would not have &euro;90,000; it would be &euro;30,000 held back over three years. In a Government situation, as the Deputy is aware, the money is either returned to the Exchequer or reallocated and then put back into the Vote. The underspends, therefore, are not quite as they appear.</P>
        <P>Part of the underspend was due to delays in recruitment. Those are being dealt with although <Col N="1160"/>there are still difficulties in getting technical staff, including engineers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree with a comment made by a former councillor, Chris Andrews, who said there is an urgent need for a root and branch reform of this organisation? Also, would he care to comment on disused properties owned by Waterways Ireland along canals, including gatekeepers&rsquo; houses and so on, that are becoming derelict? Are there plans to sell off such properties or rent them out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Deputy information on the second question but if he gives me details of the properties involved, I will certainly follow up the matter or ask Waterways Ireland to give me details of any disused properties and its policy in regard to them. The Deputy will be aware, because we had to introduce emergency legislation, that I am very concerned the State should protect its assets from dereliction and so on.</P>
        <P>All of the North-South bodies faced a difficult time over the past few years because of the changing political situation in Northern Ireland. That said, I am happy considerable progress has been made, particularly this year, in resolving many issues and progressing various projects. Some of the delays in relation to capital projects were outside the remit of the body. Those within its remit they got on with. The Royal Canal, for example, is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Ulster Canal as a cross-Border dimension?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Deputy probably saw the joint statement issued by the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, David Hanson, and me in which we asked Waterways Ireland to urgently review the reports on the Ulster Canal as they relate to a section from the Erne upwards and from Lough Neagh downwards. We are not talking about the whole canal. I have always taken the view, and I believe it is a rational one, that if we could start the work and do it in sections, we would be making progress. We have asked Waterways Ireland to give us reports as quickly as possible, using the existing literature and previous reports. I am committed, and I am sure as an Ulsterman the Deputy would support me in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I recalled to the House last June that the Law Reform Commission had published a consultation paper setting out proposals for the reform of charitable trust law.</P>
        <P>The public consultation which followed was the second of two undertaken in relation to the preparation of draft legislation to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to regulate the charities sector. My Department has since been fully apprised as to the outcome of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s deliberations in this regard.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Law Reform Commission that its proposals were largely welcomed and that its report is due to be published next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the report be made public because much information has been made public regarding the need for a law but there has been no sign of the law itself? In October 2003, we were informed that the charities (regulation) Bill would come before the House in the final quarter of that year. In January 2002, it was promised for October 2003. In May 2003, it was promised for late 2004. The dates varied from September 2003 to January 2004. In April and September 2004 it was promised for 2005. In January, it was suddenly announced that the legislation would come before the House this year, but 2005 is almost over. In April 2005 it was promised for 2006. According to the latest legislative programme, which we were given at the start of this session in September, there was no indication as to when this Bill is likely to come before us.</P>
        <P>The charities (regulation) Bill has been promised since 1980 but three previous Governments have failed to deliver on it. We now seem to be in a limbo because we do not even know when it will be published. The Minister has been quoted as saying that it is major legislation which cannot be dealt with overnight. It could have been done sometime between 1980 and 2002. What is causing the delays? Do we even have the heads of a Bill at this stage? Is June 2006 a feasible date for the introduction of this legislation? I fear that when we receive the next legislative programme at the end of January, we will see either an indeterminate date or possibly some date in 2007 for this Bill&rsquo;s publication.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first question was whether it would be made public. All the previous consultation documents and independent reports have been made public. There is a special charities webpage where all those documents have been posted. I am sure the same will apply this time. The Law Reform Commission will publish the report.</P>
        <P>As regards the dates, I hope that I did not predict the early ones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should consult the Whips&rsquo; Office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Whoever did that was a bit premature. We are, however, working at full speed and there is no delay within the Department. We hope to have the legislation out by next summer, all being well. It is a major legislation that will have over 200 sections but problems and delays can arise at different stages. Various Departments are involved and sometimes it can be difficult to get time for the parliamentary draftsman to work on it. Despite the problems we hope to succeed in bringing the legislation before the House by the summer recess.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State now says it will happen in early summer, whereas in a recent article he said it would be next spring. Does he mean by the end of the summer session or perhaps the start of the autumn session?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>T&oacute;gfaidh m&eacute; Ceisteanna Uimh. 90 agus 96 le ch&eacute;ile.</P>
        <P>My Department is scheduled to complete its move to Knock Airport by the end of 2007. As part of the decentralisation process, my Department is planning to relocate up to 40 staff in advance of the main move subject, <i>inter alia</i>, to the availability of suitable temporary accommodation in the general area. The Office of Public Works is currently seeking to source suitable accommodation and I hope that this advance move can take place by mid 2006.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is also in the process of finalising the purchase of a site for a permanent headquarters building for my Department. It is expected that a competition will be advertised shortly for the design and building of the headquarters and that work on site should begin in the second quarter of next year. All necessary work on the building is scheduled to be completed in time for staff to move to Knock Airport by the original deadline.</P>
        <P>To support the decentralisation process, my Department has prepared a comprehensive decentralisation implementation plan, which sets out steps to be taken to ensure a successful relocation. The plan follows the guidelines set down by the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation implementation group. The plan is being implemented in full consultation with managers and staff and is in line with industrial relations agreements and good practice.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to award a bonus to civil servants in my Department for agreeing to decentralise to Knock Airport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Last June, the Minister told us that he expected construction to start in the final quarter of 2005, but that has now gone back to the second quarter of 2006. He also indicated that there were 160 posts and 157 applicants. Are those applicants all from the Minister&rsquo;s Department or are they from a group of Departments?</P>
        <P>I asked the question about the bonus because garda&iacute;, teachers and nurses working in Gaeltacht areas are paid a bonus. Will the Minister inform us whether civil servants in his Department working in Furbo, County Galway, are paid a similar bonus? Are the people working in local offices in Derrybeg, Tralee and Achill paid a bonus also? Has the prospect of paying a bonus to Foras na Gaeilge staff, who are to be decentralised to Gweedore, been examined on the same basis as groups that are already in receipt of such a bonus in Gaeltacht areas?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1164"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>First of all, Knock is not in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is close.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, therefore, whatever entitlements one might have in the Gaeltacht certainly would not apply to Knock. Second, to my knowledge there is no bonus or extra payment for any civil servants operating in the Gaeltacht. The Deputy raised issues concerning garda&iacute; and others, but they relate to regulations that are made under various Acts. To the best of my knowledge, there is no difference in the wages of civil servants in my Department, irrespective of where they are based. I will confirm that for the Deputy if he wishes me to do so.</P>
        <P>We have had 187 applicants for 164 places in Knock. They do not all match off according to grades. However, I am confident that we will be able to staff Knock fully. We are working on the basis of transferring people into the Department who want to go to Knock. One of the interesting developments, which I had predicted in the beginning, is that people who are already in rural locations want to transfer. For example, people in places such as Galway and Castlebar wish to transfer to the Department in Knock. It is giving a regional choice, which is what we had hoped for, without having to come to Dublin. If someone is already in a western location and wants to work in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in Knock, that person will not want to come to Dublin for a year or two to transfer back to the west. Those are the issues but the programme is going well.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct in respect of the delays involved. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, put it well when he told Deputy Boyle that if one tries to give a deadline in an honest answer, making the best call, one is in danger of not always achieving the target. Delays can occur in purchasing properties, for example, but the decentralisation programme is proceeding well. The issues concerning decentralisation are proceeding apace and while the programme may not be going as fast as we had hoped, it is still going very well.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and myself have asked the chief executive officer of Foras na Gaeilge to furnish us with an implementation plan by the end of 2005.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 95 and 104 together.</P><Col N="1166"/>
        <P>Evidence suggests that the majority of charities in Ireland operate for the public good. However, it is vital for public trust and confidence in the sector to be safeguarded and maintained. Clearly, the lack of a regulatory regime leaves the sector vulnerable to abuses.</P>
        <P>In An Agreed Programme for Government, there is a clear commitment to regulation of the charities sector through the enactment of a comprehensive reform of charity law to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud. The new legislation will introduce an integrated system of mandatory registration, proportionate regulation and supervision. The independent regulatory body, to be positioned as the centrepiece of the regulatory regime, will be charged with setting up and maintaining a register of charities.</P>
        <P>The proposed content of the new legislation has been the subject of an inclusive, public consultation process, first, in 2004, on the core legislative proposals and then, in 2005, on the specialist aspect of charitable trust law reform. I have already publicly signalled spring-early summer 2006 as our target for publication of the Bill and my Department continues to give priority to the work of advancing this important legislation. I take this opportunity to emphasise that, in addition to statutory regulation, informed and vigilant charity trustees have a crucially important role to play in the general control and management of the administration of their charities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State is aware, in the published list of Government legislation, it states in regard to charity legislation that it is not possible to indicate a date for publication. I recently asked the T&aacute;naiste if this meant the legislation had been abandoned. While the Minister of State has indicated that it will be produced, my major concern is that the Government will go out of office and we will not even see the legislation.</P>
        <P>Fifty leaders of community and voluntary organisations were advised at a recent seminar they attended that because of the slowness of the Government in coming up with the legislation, they would have to look to their own governance. One issue that arose is that there is no proper definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo;, &ldquo;charitable organisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;not-for-profit organisation&rdquo;, or &ldquo;non-governmental organisation&rdquo;. Speculation again appeared in the media during the period of the recent bombings in London indicating that charities can be used for terrorist purposes. It was stated that the method of fundraising could be as simple as welfare fraud. Is the Minister of State satisfied that this is definitely not happening in the sector in Ireland?</P>
        <P>How convinced is the Minister of State that we will see this legislation, bearing in mind that the heads of the Bill have not yet been produced. <Col N="1167"/>This will be major legislation. Is the Government just putting a brave face on it while knowing in its heart of hearts that we will not see this legislation, badly needed as it is to regulate a sector that has been crying out for regulation for quite some time? This is not to minimise or underestimate in any way the difficulties involved. My concern is that the matter has dragged on, yet the legislation has failed to come forward with only vague assurances that it will be produced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not responsible, nor are the officials in the charity unit in the Department, for anything that should have happened over the past 40 years. The legislation has not been abandoned. The charity unit was only set up in 2003 and the officials based there are working to the best of their ability on this matter. They are doing great work. It is a small unit that is most effective. I want to get the Bill published well before the summer recess. We may not get it into the D&aacute;il before then but I hope we can bring it forward very quickly after that. I might have a vested interest in getting it passed quickly. When it comes to May or June of the following year, I do not know if I want to be spending endless days on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will be on sabbatical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Once it is published I hope we can make a great deal of progress on it. I and everybody in the unit are committed to getting this done as quickly as possible. I hope the estimate I gave is accurate but delays are possible. We are following the programme for Government. At various times the charities issue came under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and subsequently the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Since 2002 it has come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The UN or international aspect of the legislation is new. Terrorist links in recent years have given rise to a greater need for legislation and the creation of a proper regulatory regime, but it was already a commitment in the programme for Government. I do not know what is going on at present. I believe most charities operate for the public good but anything could be going wrong and until we have proper registration and regulation, we will not know the situation. That is the purpose of enacting the legislation. What has happened in recent years at United Nations level and with the European Union also getting involved gives added weight to the need for us to have updated legislation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1168"/>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept that the issue of charities regulation is a major public concern and that people demand accountability, openness and transparency? Many charities appear to be project-driven. Does he also accept that the issues of trust and how charities spend their income from the public is a priority?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree that members of the public demand that the money they give to Third World charities is spent on the most needy? Does he accept there is a role for him in rooting out fraud in charities and ensuring that money is spent on those most in need? The Minister of State replied that he did not know what exactly is going on in charities. Is it not part of his responsibility to know that, especially when taxpayers donate significant sums of money to charities every year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Deputy would listen to me. I said that what we are doing in the Department is bringing in new legislation to update the law on charities and introduce a proper regulatory regime. The sector is unregulated, there is no body with the specific aim of supervision and there is no registration. While the Revenue Commissioners issue tax exemption certificates, this is not registration, although it is sometimes confused with it. In the absence of registration and pending the passage of the legislation and the introduction of the new regulatory regime, anything could be going on. I agree that most charities are very good and are doing good work. The good ones support the introduction of a proper regulatory regime because it is necessary to ensure public confidence and trust. That is why we are taking the steps I have outlined.</P>
        <P>I am not responsible for policing charities at present &mdash; the issue is that nobody is. We are relying on the goodwill of the charities. When the legislation is enacted and the regulatory regime is in place, there will be compulsory registration and supervision, and thus charities will be called to account. This will enhance the trust and confidence of the public, which will be to the benefit of everybody in the sector. The good players in the sector realise this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point the Bill will be large and complex. Does the Minister of State see the merit in consulting the spokespersons from the Opposition parties with a view to progressing the agenda, either by making himself or his civil servants available? Thus, when the debate is held in the D&aacute;il &mdash; I take the point on long Committee Stages &mdash; some measure of agreement will have been reached on some areas in advance. Obviously, there will be some areas regarding which agreement will not be reached. This side of the House would be co-operative in dealing with this vital legislation. If there are ways of shorten<Col N="1169"/>ing its passage through the D&aacute;il and Seanad, we should avail of them. In spite of what I heard from the Minister of State, I am concerned the Government will have left office before the legislation can be passed in the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns and his offer. I will take up the offer at the appropriate time and consult him when we are discussing the specifics. Thus far, people outside the House have been happy with and supportive of the proposed Bill, although I am sure that when it is published and we are dealing with the specifics, some groups will not be happy with every provision therein.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced the launch of a special fund of &euro;300,000 that will support the development of Irish language programmes in third level institutions overseas. This will be provided through my Department&rsquo;s ciste na Gaeilge fund, which supports various projects and organisations involved in promoting the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Applications will be assessed relative to a number of criteria. These are the track record of the applicant in terms of the provision of Irish language courses and the promotion of Irish generally; the business plan of the organisation; the availability of co-funding from other sources; and the existence of courses that concentrate on teaching the language as distinct from courses that provide information on the language.</P>
        <P>Priority will be given to applications which have arrangements in place for co-funding and which provide an accredited qualification as part of the programme. A substantial number of third level institutions overseas already provide courses in Irish language and culture. I anticipate that this new fund will lead to the consolidation and further development of such courses worldwide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer. When I read the press report, my concern was that the &euro;300,000 is probably some kind of token. On checking, I discovered there are between 50 and 60 third level institutions over<Col N="1170"/>seas that teach the Irish language, be they in the United States, Canada, Australia or Europe. This is obviously a reflection on the degree to which Irish culture is esteemed and valued. However, if one divided the &euro;300,000 between the 50 or 60 institutions that exist worldwide, each would receive a sum of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;6,000, which is not very much.</P>
        <P>I am aware that, of 139 primary schools in Gaeltacht areas, only 106 teach all subjects through Irish. Of 30 post-primary schools in the Gaeltachta&iacute;, only 20 are classified as teaching all subjects through Irish. If money is to come from the Minister&rsquo;s Department for the study of the Irish language, is it not much more important that it be spent in this particular area? It is a matter of grave concern that so many Gaeltacht schools are no longer teaching all subjects through Irish. Figures I have seen suggest there were 250,000 native Irish speakers when the State was founded and that only around 20,000 people now use the Irish language as a vernacular.</P>
        <P>I worry about tokenism. The funding being made available highlights that Irish is taught in the colleges in question, which is to be welcomed, but, in order to consolidate, promote and develop the Irish language, surely to goodness the real emphasis should be placed on the shortfall in education in the Gaeltachta&iacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We are aware that we are starting the Irish language promotion scheme with a very modest sum of money. However, my experience shows that the small number of third level institutions to which we have been giving funding are very appreciative of what we regard as modest funding. We expect that the funding will act as leverage funding. In other words, for every euro we invest, another euro will become available from another source. This happened in the case of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which was able to obtain funds because we gave funds. This practice is common among universities. Therefore, if our funds are matched, there is a potential fund of &euro;600,000 for the teaching of Irish.</P>
        <P>The maximum amount any university will be able to get is &euro;30,000 while the minimum will be &euro;10,000. Allowing for matching funds, this should allow for the employment of a person to teach Irish. When I visited the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, I met representatives from that institution and representatives from other universities in the United States who indicated they regard the funding as a valuable asset.</P>
        <P>It is a well-known fact that if we want people to speak Irish at home, the standing of the language nationally and internationally will be of major importance. It will come as an eye-opener to many to find out there are universities in the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy, <Col N="1171"/>England, Scotland, Wales, Poland and Japan teaching modern Irish. That will give people a sense that many in other parts of the world value the Irish language and assist our effort to put the Irish language in its proper international context. A side effect of this scheme is that many of the students who study Irish in these universities visit Ireland and the Gaeltacht where they provide an economic boost and encourage people at home to learn the language.</P>
        <P>The budget for the Department of Education and Science runs to billions of euro and adding &euro;300,000 to that budget would make little change in the number of schools teaching through English in the Gaeltacht. That is not fundamentally an issue of money but of policy, with which we are dealing in a different context. The Deputy might clarify whether his party if it were in Government would scrap this scheme and put the money into something else.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will continue where I broke off earlier today when I was expressing my concern that this Bill is a work in progress and we have seen approximately half of the provisions it will eventually enact. We are told that there will be further additions to the Bill during its passage through the House. It is important and desirable that the full provisions of a Bill that will have far-reaching effects on many people and give more power to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are properly thought out and presented. These should not be brought in later on Committee or worse, Report Stage, as seems to happen more and more frequently.</P>
      <P>It is fine for Deputies on all sides to make suggestions which the Minister takes on board and brings forward on Committee Stage. What seems to happen, however, is that a half-formulated Bill is presented and important provisions are brought forward on later Stages. That denies Members the possibility of debating those measures. This procedure is dangerous in a republic, which means &ldquo;a thing of the people&rdquo;. I urge the Minister to introduce a Bill as a finished product, not a work in progress, unless there is some pressing reason not to do so.</P><Col N="1174"/>
      <P>It is crucial to protect citizens against crime as this Bill does, up to a point. That protection has two sides: the prevention of crime and leading people away from crime. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is in the House, wears many hats, among them Minister of State with special responsibility for children at the Department of Health and Children. The Children Act should have been fully implemented before we were presented with this Bill because it would have gone a long way towards preventing the types of activity the Bill proposes to protect.</P>
      <P>Last Monday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, was in my town, Midleton, but I could not be present at that time. Transition year students from the 11 secondary schools in the area came together at a youth forum for the day where they made presentations about issues affecting them and the solutions they wanted brought forward. Their overarching demand was for a place in the town they could call their own. Younger people, teenagers in particular, have nowhere to go and all night to go there. I have teenage children and I would not expect them to be inside at night watching television or using Playstation. That is not desirable if they cannot socialise. The Government must properly implement the Youth Work Act and put some money into the national youth work development plan. That is not currently happening. The Youth Work Act was passed in 2001 and the national youth work development plan was approved in 2003, with little or no money made available to implement it.</P>
      <P>What young people wanted was a drop-in centre where they could meet their friends, drink tea, coffee or minerals, chat and play games. They did not get it. Instead, they must hang out on the streets, outside people&rsquo;s houses. Often, people then ring the Garda to have the young people moved on. They have nowhere to go. We should be providing facilities for young people across the country. We provide sports facilities for rugby, GAA and soccer fans and that is laudable, desirable and important, but we also need to provide places where young people can safely socialise with their friends. We are not doing that. We have no proper youth service and the Government does not seem to want to provide one.</P>
      <P>Various issues and problems arise. The drugs problem is growing out of all proportion countrywide with new, dangerous and very addictive drugs coming on the scene. This problem is growing in rural areas as well as in the cities, and in most rural areas there is no youth service at all.</P>
      <P>Youth workers tell me they are overworked and under-resourced. I understand an application will soon be made to the Department of Education and Science for another youth worker in <Col N="1175"/>Midleton. I hope the Minister of State will approve that if it comes across his desk, or talk to his fellow Ministers who have a say in the matter and urge them to approve the appointment.</P>
      <P>Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il I have been making speeches on this issue in this House &mdash; not to much effect, but I will keep at it until I see action. Preventing young people from becoming involved in crime initially is the best way to go.</P>
      <P>Community policing has been mentioned. We must take care that the provisions of this Bill do not damage relations between the community police and the population at large. That is important.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I agree it is important to preserve crime scenes. In the past we have seen major problems arise as a result of not preserving such scenes. Regarding search warrants, it appears from the Bill that officers below the rank of superintendent can issue such warrants in exceptional cases. They would need to be exceptional. In cases where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a search warrant in an emergency, when a district justice is not available, some provision should be made for the warrant to be retrospectively examined by the local district justice, to ensure everything was done above board. This would be a safeguard mechanism. We have all seen cases involving a small number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exceeding their powers and doing things they should not have done. If we give the Garda more powers we must ensure this cannot happen again. If a garda is obliged to act quickly or otherwise lose evidence, a search warrant would be important, but the Garda must always act properly and not use the warrant to intimidate people or for other reasons. There should be a retrospective oversight procedure by judges or other personnel regarding search warrants issued by Garda members, with the circumstances outlined in some shape or form.</P>
      <P>I have no major problem with the issue of saliva and mouth swabs. It is sensible, and the establishment of a DNA database has proved useful in other jurisdictions. Again we must be careful it is not abused. It would work both to identify and eliminate suspects, so it could be used as a safeguard, which is important.</P>
      <P>The admission of evidence in court through statements of witnesses who refused to testify or retract original statements relates to the issue of witnesses being intimidated. We have seen such allegations in the recent past and the issue must be dealt with, so that if someone makes a statement and subsequently retracts it, the statement will still be admissible and the courts can make a judgment on it.</P>
      <P>There seem to be a great many firearms currently surfacing. We do not know where they come from and it is a major worry. Criminal <Col N="1176"/>gangs appear to be involved in executions in Dublin and abroad. Operation Anvil has been successful but we need to boost it and ensure the Garda has the proper resources to deal with the situation. We have seen reports of international criminals moving into Ireland. As the country becomes wealthier, that is to be expected. People trafficking also seems to be happening across Europe, and Ireland is not an exception. I encourage and support the Minister of State in anything he can do to deal with that problem and keep it under control. It is a serious issue.</P>
      <P>I note we are to have a provision dealing with criminal organisations. As I have not yet seen the text I cannot comment. However, such organisations are growing. We have seen <i>mafiosi </i>in other countries and if they are beginning to operate here, that is a serious worry. The Government is the only organisation which can bring forward legislation on this matter and ensure the Garda has the resources, possibly including a special unit, to deal with it.</P>
      <P>As far as possible, we need to pursue the drug trafficking kingpins and throw the book at them. Very often we deal only with those way down on the pecking order in this criminal activity. Clearly they must be discouraged but we must pursue the big boys making the big money. The Criminal Assets Bureau has done much good work in this area and that must continue.</P>
      <P>There have been mixed reports about the use of electronic tagging. If it is to be used, it must be used carefully, and there must be an ongoing evaluation of how it works. Regarding the new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners, the only drug-free prison in the country, the one on Spike Island in Cork, has been closed. I understand the other prisons have different issues with regard to drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Spike Island will be re-opened at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We had that debate before. Spike Island is currently closed and the issue is whether the island is a suitable location for a prison given that it is a major historical site. From a retail point of view, Cobh is dying on its feet. There is nobody there, with no business being conducted and shops closing. If Spike Island were opened as a major historical centre in the manner of Alcatraz or Robben Island, it could become a magnet to pull people through Cobh. Clearly, the project would need to be evaluated in economic terms, and UCC has people who could do that. They might bring business to Cobh and then continue to the island. Deputy Dennehy is familiar with the place, not from spending time there but because he is from the area. From a tourism point of view, Spike Island is unique. I ask the Department to re-examine this matter. A prison may be built <Col N="1177"/>anywhere within reason but there is nowhere in Ireland like Spike Island. It lies in the midst of one of the most beautiful harbours in the world and is of major historical and architectural significance. If marketed properly as a tourist attraction, it could benefit the entire region. I put that case to the Minister of State and ask the Government to consider the island&rsquo;s fate before any final decision is made.</P>
      <P>This project may not commence for a lengthy period of time because of the planning involved. Some years ago, I was quoted a price of &euro;10 million for the construction of a bridge to the island. If a new prison has to be built, it may be more cost effective to buy a farm to the north of the city as a site. People have to visit prisons but it is not easy for family members to access Spike Island and would not be even if a bridge was built.</P>
      <P>The supply of drugs to prisoners is a serious matter because prisons should be places where people are rehabilitated. In terms of the philosophy behind the Bill, Members have expressed concerns that people may be needlessly criminalised. When people are criminalised, they become stigmatised and it is difficult to resolve such situations. We must prevent people from being criminalised in the first instance.</P>
      <P>However, we must also protect members of the public. I come across regular examples to illustrate this point. Recently, I received a telephone call from a woman who had contacted the garda&iacute; because her house was being stoned and her car smashed. The first time the garda&iacute; responded, their squad car and its flashing blue lights were apparent from a mile away, which gave the boys time to escape. On a subsequent occasion, the garda&iacute; were able to catch the teenage culprit because they drove an unmarked car and wore plain clothes. This was an example of good thinking that meant the boy was dealt with. Hopefully the affair will act as a deterrent to others.</P>
      <P>The Garda must be given the support it requires to put as many of its members on the beat as possible because visibility is important. We should also consider the victims of crime. The Minister of State may tell us what the State is doing for those at the receiving end of crime.</P>
      <P>I do not have more to say because the full Bill is not before us. I may have a further opportunity to speak on Report Stage. The legislation is in place to take action with regard to youth services but unfortunately, the political will does not seem to exist. This Bill attempts to address one aspect of the issue but does nothing for the others. Youth work can help young people to develop leadership and citizenship skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The intention of this Bill is to enhance the powers of garda&iacute; to investigate and prosecute offences and <Col N="1178"/>provide for improvements in the operation of the criminal justice system. I join with the Minister and others in paying tribute to the late Eamon Leahy, senior counsel, for the work he has done in this regard. It is somewhat disappointing that his report, which was put forward in late 1998, is only now being implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister added provisions that he deemed necessary to take account of a changing situation. He has been criticised for introducing a surfeit of legislation but many of the proposed changes are intended to counteract defence lawyers who act for suspected criminals. The issues that can be brought forward to evade blatant breaches of the law are incredible to those who are not members of the legal professions. It is reasonable that, as often as necessary, this House should review and amend laws containing loopholes that can be circumvented by clever lawyers. It has been said that one may get away with murder if the right lawyer is hired. We have seen that happen in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has expertise available to draft and implement laws to address various situations. However, the public has concerns on the many cases that are lost for flimsy reasons. This applies in situations ranging from drink driving to high profile and dangerous offences. The interactions between component parts of the process of justice, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Judiciary, the legal profession and the Garda are beyond the comprehension of most people and the public suffers because of this. Garda&iacute; are also concerned because on many occasions they have become the meat in the sandwich.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department and members of the Judiciary and the legal profession have similar training, work environments and rules. They speak a different language to the rest of us and it can be difficult to understand what they do. Garda&iacute;, who must fully interact with the public, are the frontline for the justice system. They implement the law and literally put their lives on the line. They are expected to prevent crime, assist community activities and investigate and prosecute crimes. However, they are at times treated as the poor relation within the justice system. On occasion, we have seen accounts of that in the media.</P>
      <P>We are constantly told that society is changing, which is true with regard to the criminal sector. New technology is used to defraud ATM machines. There are new ways to make and distribute drugs, commit white collar crimes and smuggle persons with regard to sex crimes. New types of offensive weapons such as machine pistols are being used. A range of nasty changes have taken place. Garda powers must be increased to enable garda&iacute; to combat such criminal activity.</P><Col N="1179"/>
      <P>Several speakers referred to incidents in Donegal, west Cork and other areas where an abuse of Garda powers is perceived to have taken place. Such incidents must be forcefully dealt with, but they are exceptions to the rule. They cannot be used, as seemed to be implied in one or two of the contributions, to prevent the introduction of good law enforcement by good law enforcers. Garda&iacute; must have the power they need to deal with such changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is long past time that a Garda ombudsman was in place as well as various other measures, but those necessary developments are evolving. It is also essential that the Garda has audio-visual aid equipment in place for interviewing suspects, a matter to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>One could ask who would want to be a garda in the current circumstances. Members may have seen a television report of an incident, in regard to which I want to be careful not to pre-judge the inquiry into it, where garda&iacute; had to use firearms and shoot people who were carrying out a crime. Before they left the scene, calls for an inquiry were made from expected sources. Less than a week after that incident, I read of an off-duty garda having been almost kicked to death because he was known to be a garda and as a result of which he suffered horrific injuries. I have yet to hear of anyone from those sources seeking an inquiry into that incident or offering a word of consolation or sympathy to that garda.</P>
      <P>We had a philosophical contribution from Deputy Cuffe who spent some time trying to figure out whether he or the Minister, Deputy McDowell, was the greater liberal. The Deputy referred to the various labels attached to both of them. He went on to say something about which I am concerned, namely, that the State should not get involved in the nitty gritty of people&rsquo;s lives. That is an approach that deals with the theory of what is wrong but does not do anything to address the practice in that regard. It is suggested that the State should not interfere in people&rsquo;s lives and, if it does, this could become a nanny state.</P>
      <P>We pay lip-service by saying we would not tolerate a situation where people aged 70, 80 or 90 are virtually unable to leave their homes after twilight. I am sick of the excuse that the people who hang around the homes of these elderly people have nowhere else to go. I have been involved for 35 to 40 years in community development, am the chairman of a community council and am involved with the scouts and various other issues. The people gathering with the bottles and cans will not go on to a soccer pitch or hurling pitch or a basketball court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that has been proven. I will show people who advocate the theory of encouraging such participation but who are not involved in the practical side of dealing with these people sports facilities and the gangs gathered within 200 or 300 yards of them. We cannot tolerate that situation being experienced by people, especially those to whose needs we pay lip-service. We say they built the State and gave us our chance, but they cannot live their lives in a safe environment.</P>
      <P>An attempt was made by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with this situation by introducing legislation. On that occasion before the night was out, a few of the more prominent groups, whom I will not name, some of whom were associated with religious groups and various other interests, attacked the Bill on the basis of civil liberties. They said that these young people would be deprived of their civil liberties. That was the only reason for power not being granted to move such gangs on.</P>
      <P>My local superintendent told me on one occasion that garda&iacute; could only move these people on by 100 yards or so, but I told him I was talking about moving these people on at 2 a.m., not 2 p.m. They have ghetto blasters with them at that time. I found it incredible they could not be moved on further. Opposition Members have advised me, as probably have some Members on the Government side, that there is sufficient law in place, but that superintendent told me he could not move such a gang on. I gave him details of the time and place these people gather and I have seen them.</P>
      <P>I have been deeply involved in Cork community services council from its foundation and I can tell Members that those people who gather will not use sports facilities. I have worked with clubs and other groups to put facilities in place. A local curate was told by the same gang exactly what he could do with a timber building facility he had provided because they would burn it down. Members should not tell me that such gangs do not gather in neighbourhoods.</P>
      <P>I met three groups in one night complaining about the anti-social behaviour of young people, including a group near my home. The incredible message from the parents in each place was that none of the offenders was local. I said that somebody must be bussing these people from spot to spot. Nobody was prepared to accept responsibility. There is a refusal to accept responsibility.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cuffe who cited a quote by a former Garda Commissioner that it will not be force of arms that will keep the peace but rather good police work. It is impossible to police people who do not want to be policed. That is a fact. There must be an acceptance by the public of the need for the Garda to enforce the rules and regulations. That quotation, like another <Col N="1181"/>quotation by &Eacute;amon de Valera about dancing at the crossroads, is a bit dated. We must adopt a more modern approach. We need a policing board in place and we need to support the force.</P>
      <P>Members of the force must work at times in dreadful and disgraceful circumstances in dealing with the dregs of society. Their representative, P. J. Stone, said:</P>
      <P LI="1">Would you think on-the-spot fines would work for a drunken lout who can neither leave nor drive? They better make sure they have a litter warden around as well.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That was a reaction to on-the-spot fines which would have been sent by post to the person concerned, as was carefully explained. That kind of reaction is no good to the Garda either. They need to deal with such cases and need our support in doing so. Some Members talk about situations from which they are somewhat removed. I do not know if they mix with the same type of people I see in action. Many of the situations outlined are not based on the facts. I subscribe to the need for recreational facilities but we should not allow gangs to terrorise people. We all have our duty. We may have had to put the boot up the backside of one of our own from time to time and that should be done.</P>
      <P>My community garda has told me that when calls to a door, a parent will argue that no way was his or her son or daughter the person he had to pull out of a drunken crowd to stop a fight. That has happened in high profile cases, particularly in Dublin, where the parents would not believe that their sons were responsible for the vandalism done. In that regard, I am sure we would all have something to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>There are families throughout the country who are not well off but it is not members of those families who stagger out of the nightclub or the superpub at midnight or 1 a.m., rather it is members of families who are well off. What excuse have they for such behaviour? They have had the benefit of education and yet, as P. J. Stone said, they behave like drunken louts. We are tolerant of such behaviour.</P>
      <P>Three or four months ago I had a fracture and had to attend an accident and emergency department. It was 2 p.m. and work in the department came to a halt because of the appearance of a regular customer with three garda&iacute; who were trying to hold him down while three or four hospital staff tried to deal with him. He cursed everybody, including nurses, and that was tolerated. We are too accepting of bad behaviour.</P>
      <P>The issue of roads was raised by Deputy Keaveney and I agree there should be a traffic corps. We are all aware that 3,646 people were killed in the North over 25 years. That number of people are being killed in half that time on the roads. People are effectively being murdered on <Col N="1182"/>the roads and it is tolerated. If garda&iacute; set up a speed trap near a town, they are considered to be sneaky, yet most of the fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians happen on the fringes of towns. If garda&iacute; were to set up a speed trap on a motorway, people would not want to be stopped on the one good section of road. We all contribute to the problem and I am concerned about it.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s complaint about organised crime gangs, firearms offences, drug trafficking and electronic tagging. That is a legitimate case but let us look at the existing powers. The issue of the admissibility of statements by witnesses has flared up in one city in particular. On the last occasion it happened, we had to set up a branch of the Special Criminal Court. That was one of the other options. People will say they are being harassed and the issue of civil liberties will be trotted out. That is probably the most abused phrase in the country.</P>
      <P>There is also the statutory power to preserve a crime scene. As a non-legal person I had thought that right always existed and I find it incredible that it did not. There is a general power in regard to the issue of search warrants. It took the Revenue Commissioners approximately 15 to 20 years to reach the point where they were given the right to obtain search warrants and we have seen the intake from that change. Until then we were told one could not enter private houses and that it was an infringement of people&rsquo;s rights. Where did the infringement of rights of those who did not pay any taxes for generations leave the rights of the rest of us who paid them? In my case, as mentioned previously, the tax rate was 67% and there were nine of us to feed. Since Revenue was given the power to enter and search premises, billions of euro have been taken in. Obviously it was a necessary power.</P>
      <P>On the issue of increased detention powers of up to 24 hours for arrestable offences, technical issues have been raised in the past. That people are trained to look at the spot on the wall has created difficulties and needs to be examined. Some amendments were made to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act because we thought it was crazy that the taking of saliva and mouth swabs was prohibited. It is similar to the problem that existed with the dental faculty where those other than orthodontists and dentists were not allowed to make molars or dentures as it was invasion of a person&rsquo;s body. The change in this Bill is a logical step. Deputy Costello and others who have been spokespersons for many years will cite some reason this should not happen but it is the most logical step that has been enacted in a long time.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Stanton I hope Deputy Costello&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Two issues that have frustrated the public are the refusal to reveal the reasons a person is not prosecuted &mdash; this is especially frustrating for victims and their families &mdash; and the failure to appeal a case in certain circumstances, especially on points of law. We are all familiar with the scenario where the lawyers negotiate and suddenly, even though everybody knows the accused is guilty, he or she walks away, usually with a smirk on his or her face, because of some frivolous point of law. As a lay person I welcome the extension of power in the Bill to deal with this.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well. Many issues were raised but I do not have the time to deal with them. As a humble backbencher who is not involved in the legal profession and is not a spokesperson, I hope to voice the views of those I represent who are being harassed in their homes, have terrible lives at times and cannot walk the streets because of drunks and others.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is wide-ranging legislation which seeks to amend and extend the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of offences and includes the provision for the admissibility in evidence of certain witness statements.</P>
      <P>The first issue I wish to address is the admissibility in evidence of certain witness statements. I could never understand the culture that accepted the withdrawal of statements even at the risk of arriving at decisions which were clearly wrong. We all remember the genesis of this particular section which involved a well-known Limerick criminal.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides that a person sent for trial can have statements made by him or her to garda&iacute; admitted as evidence, even though the witness denies making the statements or refuses to give evidence. This is to be welcomed as the position heretofore was making a laughing stock of the courts and sapping the morale of garda&iacute; who had to endure the ridiculous situation of a criminal or criminal associates clearly lying by denying they had made a statement, which they clearly had, or withdrawing a statement in a clear attempt to frustrate the courts or, even worse, withdrawing it under duress from others. A continuation of this ridiculous situation would have had the effect <Col N="1184"/>of undermining the courts and surely would have left garda&iacute; asking themselves why they bothered.</P>
      <P>The greatest way to undermine the pillars of society is to allow criminals give the two fingers to the institutions of State. That is what was happening in this case. If the Bill did nothing else, other than this, it would be worthwhile legislation. In a democracy we could not allow a situation to continue where persons were forced to withdraw statements under duress from the criminal fraternity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill that allow for the authorising of a search by a chief superintendent without a search warrant in certain circumstances. It appears excessively bureaucratic to have members of the Garda obtain a search warrant from a District Court judge in circumstances where they are aware there are stolen goods on a premises. This is an unnecessary burden placed on the work of garda&iacute; and further frustrates and hinders them in their work. If people do not have anything to hide, they should have no objection to the forces of law and order entering their premises. If they have something to hide, why should the forces of law and order not be in a position to gain access as quickly as possible and with the least bureaucratic resistance as possible? This is a practical measure which will assist the Garda in its work.</P>
      <P>One of the scourges of our communities is anti-social behaviour. I am not satisfied that all that can be done to root out anti-social behaviour is being done. What we need is a comprehensive community policing system. It may sound dated and old hat but garda&iacute; are needed on the beat and in sufficient numbers to allow them time to work in the community to get to know the people to find out who exactly is engaging in anti-social behaviour and to frustrate them.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that the cumbersome no-leader, multi-agency approach is the way forward. The involvement of the social services, juvenile liaison officers, the Department of Education and Science and social workers could be described as a windy, convoluted and excessively bureaucratic approach to dealing with problems which, in many cases, could be nipped in the bud if more garda&iacute; were on the beat interacting with communities and liaising with community leaders. I do not agree that Irish society has changed so much that the notion of a return to the old way of policing would not work. If we had the required number of garda&iacute; it would work.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the thorny issue of the Government promise to recruit 2,000 additional garda&iacute;. The promise does not reflect the reality and the number of additional garda&iacute; recruited was just a fraction of what was promised. The reality of the Government&rsquo;s broken promise in this area is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Government colleagues <Col N="1185"/>can introduce all the legislation they like but it will not be enforced because of the lack of garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Many of today&rsquo;s anti-social problems have their origins in planning inefficiencies throughout the years under successive Governments. Large housing estates with no facilities are breeding grounds for anti-social behaviour. While this is well recognised it is ignored. The Government has yet to take decisions to eliminate the blight of bad planning.</P>
      <P>A case in point is the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey. He was very courageous in introducing the social housing obligations in that legislation. He had been inspired to do so for a number of reasons one of which was the need for social integration in our housing developments &mdash; a very laudable aspiration, but one which regrettably did not survive for long.</P>
      <P>His successor as Minister, Deputy Cullen, was not a wet week in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when he rowed back on this element of the legislation and introduced a number of ways developers could meet their social housing obligations, including a provision whereby developers could meet their social housing obligations on land other than lands within the site of the development, a very retrograde step, no doubt introduced at the behest of big business and big builders. This change in the legislation has resulted in a developer in County Galway who is providing state-of-the-art expensive housing for the well-heeled intelligentsia in a site in Oranmore in the constituency of Galway West meeting his social housing obligations not in Oranmore but 30 miles away in Headford, which is in the constituency of Galway East. This is an absolute disgrace and has come about because the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, changed legislation introduced by his socially conscious predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, at the behest of big builders.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of decision that guarantees that we will have segregated communities with no integration leading to a continuation of anti-social behaviour. This is the clearest modern-day example of the creation of a two-tier society that one could imagine. It is a nauseating concept resulting from shameful direct Government action.</P>
      <P>The elderly in my constituency of Galway East are in fear of being invaded in their homes, attacked, hurt and robbed by marauding gangs terrorising rural Ireland. Our senior citizens deserve better protection from the forces of law and order and from the State than they are getting at present. However, they are not being afforded that protection by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because it does not have personnel to provide the <Col N="1186"/>service to which our senior citizens are entitled. In a so-called caring society with a so-called concerned Government it is disgraceful that senior citizens who lived their lives with their doors open to everybody should now be prisoners in their own homes, living in fear for their lives.</P>
      <P>I welcome the many good elements of the Bill. However, it is pointless to pass legislation through this House when the resources and personnel are not being provided to enforce it. I object to discussing legislation on the blind, as it were. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 was presented to the House and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform then informed us that he intended introducing major and extensive amendments. Such a <i>modus operandi</i> makes a mockery of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill&rsquo;s explanatory memorandum states, &ldquo;The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the criminal law, particularly in the area of criminal investigations, which will enhance Garda powers in tackling crime and will generally improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the criminal justice system&rdquo;. If this is proved to be true I would generally welcome such a move. We are now living in a society with high crime rates, a general sense of fear for their safety among ordinary decent people and a sense of fearlessness among thugs who feel they can do what they like and get away with it. We have to do something to improve this situation. The implementation of this Bill could do something to help but I feel it is not enough. We need a real change in society and society&rsquo;s reaction to crime and crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The Bill concentrates on areas of criminal investigation and enhancing the powers of the Garda, but it does nothing in addressing the causes of many crimes. It does nothing to promote a community response to crime and its causes. It does nothing to address educational issues to assist in crime prevention and it does nothing to offer support to any groups other than the Garda in the area of crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The Government has once again attempted to introduce legislation to tackle important issues in our society but such legislation is of no use unless the necessary resources are put in place to support it. We have been barraged by a series of reforms in legislation only to hear from relevant Ministers afterwards that they do not have the money to provide the necessary resources. Almost every question asked of a Minister in this D&aacute;il is given the answer that while the Government is considering taking action it does not have the resources or finance to deal with the problem. Such a response is becoming a sick joke. When will the Government realise that it needs to provide the necessary resources for any such legislation to be effective?</P><Col N="1187"/>
      <P>People in housing estates in many parts of Ireland are living in fear because of intimidation by groups of thugs who control the streets in such estates. People in my constituency in such places as Kilrush and Cloughleigh in Ennis are living in such fear. They are being held prisoner in their own homes by thugs who are involved in all sorts of anti-social behaviour and other crimes in the area. They are afraid to go out at night for fear of being attacked. They are afraid their cars will be stolen or set on fire, that their houses will be robbed or burned down and most of all they fear for the safety of their families and loved ones. These decent people feel they are powerless to do anything about crime in their areas.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to increase the power of the Garda in its investigation of crimes in the belief that this will lead to more convictions and thus to a reduction of future such crimes. I feel this is a mistaken belief because the Government is not supplying the Garda with the additional resources it requires to combat crime in these areas. We need additional garda&iacute; on the beat in housing estates throughout the country. People need to feel safe in their homes in the knowledge that garda&iacute; are patrolling their areas. The Garda needs funding to provide the additional resources associated with additional staff.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for additional resources to be provided to those sections of the Garda, such as community garda&iacute; and juvenile liaison officers, who do valuable work in crime prevention and reduction and, in co-operation with other agencies such as the youth service and local community groups, offer real opportunities for participation in society by some people who could otherwise become involved in crime. Great work is being done in these areas but they are sadly under-resourced and the introduction of new powers of arrest will do nothing to help them. They need funding and resources to do their jobs and I call on the Government to increase their budgets in the areas of crime prevention and crime reduction as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>If we can educate people to live in any way that shows respect for other people and their property and encourages the entire community to play an active part in society, then we will have a significant reduction in anti-social behaviour and crime in housing estates.</P>
      <P>Crime is not only of concern in housing estates. It is of major concern in rural areas too. Elderly people, particularly those in isolated rural areas are in constant fear of their homes being broken into, robbed, of being beaten or even killed by mindless thugs who have no respect for anyone. The Government has systematically worked towards the withdrawal of services from rural Ireland, by reducing the number of garda&iacute; and the availability of health services and attempting to get rid of services such as the postman calling to <Col N="1188"/>homes, which not only provided a postal service but a source of personal contact for vulnerable elderly people in isolated areas. The Government needs to act on these issues and to show respect for elderly people who worked all their lives to make this country what it is today. It is a disgrace that elderly people now feel that we are too mean and too caught up in corporate Ireland to care for them and ensure that they feel safe in their own homes. It is ironic that this Bill devotes much space to defining the place of a crime when we all know that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have sufficient resources or manpower to patrol such places of crime. It would be better if the Government spent our money on patrolling the places of crime rather than on defining them.</P>
      <P>It is vital that we start with the root causes of many of the crimes that plague our society today and that we approach the issues from many angles. Provision of greater powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as outlined in this Bill, is one such angle but is useless on its own and will not have the desired effect. If we do not adopt a wider approach we are wasting our time with piecemeal legislation. We need to provide sufficient resources for those involved in the fight against crime. This includes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, youth organisations and caring organisations that work with the authorities in the provision of educational, recreational and social programmes which promote the social inclusion of people who are effectively excluded from mainstream Irish society. We must provide adequate resources for those who work with children, in particular, to ensure that the younger generation can grow up in a society where they feel a sense of belonging, responsibility and respect.</P>
      <P>According to Ms Norah Gibbons, director of advocacy with the Irish children&rsquo;s charity, Barnardos:</P>
      <P LI="1">Children tend not to commit particularly serious or violent crimes. This does not mean that when a child is involved in criminal activity, it should be ignored. All children involved in offending need assistance as do their families. A recent study commissioned by the Department of Justice and compiled by researcher Sinead McPhillips of the Irish Association for the Study of Delinquency, involving the detailed files of over 50 young people appearing before the children&rsquo;s court in Dublin, showed:</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p4-?><?oasys _ix?>Delays of up to two years in dealing with cases of young people appearing before the Children&rsquo;s Court &mdash; effectively delaying any official action to change any of these young people&rsquo;s behaviour</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p4-?><?oasys _ix?>Children appearing before the court tend to come from the most deprived parts of the city and from difficult family backgrounds i.e. where there had been a <Col N="1189"/>breakdown in the relationship between parents, where there were no parents or where there was a criminal record in the family</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p4-?><?oasys _ix?>Educational disadvantage was also a significant problem with three out of four having left school before the age of 16</P>
      <P LI="1">Ireland needs to provide a range of services to its children and young people if we want to avoid the consequences of a divided society with those who are on the outside feeling they have no stake in our now wealthy society. This means the Government honouring its commitments to end child poverty and initiate a comprehensive early years programme, ensuring children who are not benefiting from our education system can do so.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Diversion from the formal system remains the most effective way of dealing with most children and young people who offend. We can do what years of research and experience tell us is effective and works or we can move towards an increasingly punitive environment for children who offend. Children under 12 committing offences is more a symptom of us as adults and parents and government failing them.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
      <P FLI="0">We need to ensure that we do not fail these children and that adequate resources are provided for those who work with them. It is a pointless exercise passing legislation if the Government does not provide the necessary resources to implement legislative provisions. The Youth Work Bill 2000 is an example of such practice, where the relevant legislation has been passed into law but youth services are still waiting for money to be provided to implement its provisions. That is a damning indictment of this Government.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind recent revelations regarding Garda misconduct, I have some concerns about increasing the powers of garda&iacute; in situations where they are the sole or main arbiter of petty crimes or social order offences. The Bill empowers garda&iacute; to issue, without appeal, on-the-spot fines, with a refusal to pay leading to criminal prosecution. I am also gravely concerned with the proposal to revoke a citizen&rsquo;s right to withdraw a statement which may have been made under duress or intimidation. I understand the reasons behind such a move, as evidence in recent court cases where people who had previously given statements appeared to suffer gross amnesia, but a denial of rights to all our citizens is not the way to solve that problem. A better method should be found.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Government should rethink its approach to crime and adopt a position that includes the provision of adequate resources and funding for those involved in upholding the law, that is the <Col N="1190"/>Garda, and those involved, in association with the Garda, in crime prevention. The Government must ensure that adequate resources are in place before enacting legislation such as this. We need a fuller debate in this House on law and order, in light of recent events relating to the abuse of power by some members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in light of the disgraceful lack of resources which is preventing the relevant groups from carrying out their work effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 purports to be an act to amend the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the investigation of offences. In fact it is a typical Progressive Democrats, Fianna F&aacute;il response to problems of crime in our society. Essentially, it addresses the issue of crime or criminal behaviour in some sectors by giving more generally repressive powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the State. No analysis has been done of alternative means of effectively responding to crime and creating a society where crime would be the exception rather than the rule.</P>
      <P>There is a frightening meanness and cruelty in some of the crimes catalogued in the media on a daily basis, as perpetrators come before the courts. Undoubtedly, people who are guilty of such crimes need to be taken out of society for a period and, one would hope, rehabilitated or retrained so that they can live again in society as an asset rather than a destructive force. However, what is never analysed is that the meanness we see perpetrated by certain people, in a criminal fashion, mirrors the meanness of the philosophy by which the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il dictate many negative trends in our society today, particularly with regard to the governance of economic affairs and the rules governing the economy, property and income.</P>
      <P>We have a very narrow definition of crime. It is a crime to mug a person or to break into somebody&rsquo;s home and steal. These should be considered serious crimes. However, it is not a crime for a corporate entity to rob hundreds of workers of their livelihood in pursuit profit. It is not a crime for Irish Ferries to replace 540 permanent workers on trade union rates of pay and conditions with semi-bonded labour on semi-slave rates. What is the subliminal message the philosophy the current Government and elements of the business establishment send out in this regard? This type of immorality and criminality sets a headline for those who cannot aspire to such methods of exploitation. These people are not in the corporate board rooms or in the board rooms of the financial institutions, but they are equally greedy as those who are. Their methods, which would be considered in the media to be venial methods, include mugging, robbing and imposition on one&rsquo;s neighbours, often in working <Col N="1191"/>class communities. The Bill deals with that narrow understanding of what crime constitutes in society. Many of its provisions attempt to deal with a very narrow concept and narrow range of crimes, but those provisions have serious repercussions for the wider society generally and, in particular, for the civil rights of the majority in society.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P Just="Left">Section 5(1) gives the right to a garda superintendent to issue a search warrant to members of the Garda to enter and search premises. I am very concerned about this. Section 5(1)(<i>a</i>)(6) means that when the garda&iacute; enter under the authority of a search warrant given by a superintendent, they can require any person present where the search is being carried out to give to the member his or her name and address and if one refuses, one is guilty of a criminal offence. If this power had been given to that element of the Garda who were responsible for horrendous invasion of people&rsquo;s rights in Donegal over an extended period, to what end would this power have been used? Even if we remove a motivation which is as venial as the activities of a certain element of the Garda in Donegal, we can see how a provision such as this could be used as a general trawl for information, including information about people who had no hand, act or part in crime but in whom the garda&iacute; might be interested for their own reasons, or for reasons other than the alleged reason for a garda superintendent being provided with a search warrant.</P>
      <P>Section 8(<i>c</i>)(i)(<i>bb</i>) extends by 100% the length of time a person can be detained in a Garda station before being charged. If one takes the rest period, it means the length of time one can be detained in a Garda station will be extended to a potential 32 hours or almost one and a half days. I am very concerned about this. Other organisations with a human rights remit are equally concerned. Some recent examples are to be investigated whereby people came out of Garda stations, allegedly damaged, and perhaps even fatally so, as a result of what transpired within the precincts of the station. Doubling the time, which is unnecessary, increases the possibility of such occurrences.</P>
      <P>Section 29 is extraordinary. It gives a garda the right to impose an on-the-spot fine. This is an incredible provision whereby ordinary members of the Garda are now being given judicial powers. They will not have to go before a judge or a District Court to prove anything. They can decide immediately that one is guilty of breaking the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and impose a fine. I have not seen the fine referred to anywhere. I do not know the amounts it is proposed to impose if the Bill is passed. It is particularly outrageous, considering that it is imposed under sections of the 1994 Act that are incredibly impressionistic in the criteria by which an offence <Col N="1192"/>is said to have taken place. Section 5 of the 1994 Act indicates that it shall be an offence for any person in a public place to engage in offensive conduct. &ldquo;Offensive conduct&rdquo; means any unreasonable behaviour which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to cause serious offence or serious annoyance to any person who is, or might reasonably be expected to be, aware of such behaviour. It was a shameful day when this was passed and the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il carry responsibility for this. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, who regards himself as being in the more liberal wing of Fianna F&aacute;il might like to revisit that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The section states that it shall be an offence for any person to engage in offensive conduct. This presumes these people would cause serious offence or serious annoyance. On foot of this provision, a garda can impose an on-the-spot fine and, if the person does not pay the on-the-spot fine, he or she will be charged and brought before the court. This will mean a significant increase in the numbers dragged before the courts under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. A garda who might exercise a certain judgment under the current Act might tell a person to go away and not annoy him or her because her or she will not go to the trouble of bringing the person to the station or before the courts on foot of what the person is doing. It will be much easier for the garda to say he or she will slap a fine on the person and to give them notice of that, and if that is not acted on, the person will be brought before the courts. Young people generally will fall foul of this, even though they have not committed a serious breach. They will find themselves pressurised into paying the on-the-spot fine to avoid having to go to court and take a chance on the judge taking the garda&rsquo;s view of events, which is normally the case.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I refer to 1 May 2004 when European Union Heads of State attended a meeting in Dublin. This incident should be examined to see how such all embracing provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 can be abused. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government turned Dublin into a police fortress and serious civil rights abuses were perpetrated for which the Minister was responsible. During the weeks leading up to the meeting, the media, elements of the security establishment and Government elements behind the scenes, whipped up hysteria about Dublin being taken over by mobs, anarchists and various dangerous elements.</P>
      <P>Water cannon were supplied to the Garda and we witnessed a dress rehearsal of what inevitably happened. The Garda, at the slightest pretext, <Col N="1193"/>rolled out their cannon to demonstrate their use on the Navan Road, which borders my constituency, for the first time in the history of the State. A total of 25 people were arrested under the public order Act. It is incredible that they were kept in jail from 1 May in some cases until 5 May having fallen foul of one or two provisions of the Act. It is disgraceful that this has not been commented on more. One of the accused was charged with the most grievous crime of stealing a garda&rsquo;s cap and he was remanded in custody by a judge who was seized of the same effete rage as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that thousands of young people would dare to campaign against what the EU political establishment represented, and in opposition to the war in Iraq. However, this incident passed with scarcely a comment.</P>
      <P>The Minister wishes to give powers to be used at a whim by members of the Garda. Other pillars of the establishment, business people and speculators, have paraded before tribunals for eight years on foot of a suspicion of being involved in shady dealing for their own enrichment at enormous cost to society. Few of them have darkened the doorway of a prison by contrast with the 25 young people arrested on May Day 2004. The summation of this incident is that in a capitalist society the law, the courts and the apparatus of the state protect the establishment and will suppress those who are in opposition to it to different degrees depending on the situation.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister proposes to introduce the so-called anti-social behaviour orders on a future Stage of the Bill. It is disgraceful that we do not have sight of what he intends to do on this Stage. I do not care what form such orders take because they will not be the solution to anti-social behaviour. They are an instrument by which youth will be criminalised and they do not address the problem. However, instead of examining appropriate alternatives and solutions, we have this excuse for a policy, which looks good as a soundbite and which will throw dust in the eyes for those suffering because of anti-social behaviour in our society.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not provided positive measures and investment, which will achieve the social integration of young people who are alienated and which will correct the planning disasters which threw significant numbers of poor people on top of each other. New housing developments are incredible. In Tyrellstown in my constituency, which I share with the Minister of State, 2,000 new homes were built in four years but no community facility was provided, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has come up with ASBOs to deal with problems there.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has questions to answer about the implementation of the Children Act 2001 and the many constructive proposals within it, which could lead young people away from <Col N="1194"/>becoming a scourge on their neighbours on housing estates at an early stage.</P>

	<P>The briefing material relating to the legislation presents it as &ldquo;a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences and generally provide for improvements to the operation of the criminal justice system&rdquo;. Aspects of this anything but comprehensive Bill may be useful in that they will focus attention on the need for changing strategies to deal with, on the one hand, organised crime and, on the other, anti-social behaviour, which is an increasing problem in many of the local urban communities I represent.</P>
      <P>However, if we had a fairer and more equal society, the number of crimes we experience, including those relating to organised gangs and local issues, would be much reduced. The Progressive Democrats philosophy on social inequality is a significant contributory factor to some of the crime problems experienced. This is particularly true of drug related crime, organised or otherwise, and the increasing anti-social behaviour. Disadvantaged inner city areas and larger urban suburbs where disadvantage is concentrated are the areas that experience the highest levels of this type of criminal activity. Thanks to the views expressed by the governor of Mountjoy it is no secret that a disproportionate number of prisoners come from these same areas. This does not happen by chance but is a direct result of the extreme inequalities in our society. Although the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present, he told us that one of the tenets of the Progressive Democrats is that <Col N="1195"/>inequality is good for the economy. Inequality is a destabilising factor of major significance that contributes to levels of crime in our society.</P>
      <P>I refer briefly to some measures in this Bill. The briefing document refers to detention of up to 24 hours for arrestable offences. To the public this may seem necessary and reasonable. Are safeguards in place to ensure this measure is not abused? The Minister has not helped us to understand this issue. We await a decision from the Minister on an inquiry into the Dean Lyons case in which an innocent man was charged with the Grangegorman murders following his detention by garda&iacute;. We have discussed the details of this case on many occasions in this House. I have pursued this matter with a reluctant Minister, much like the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue. Both appear to wish the case would disappear rather than doing the responsible thing by investigating what happened to Dean Lyons. The case did not go away. A recent move, having a senior counsel examine Garda papers on the case, had to be dragged out of the Minister. We are still no wiser about what the Minister will do.</P>
      <P>I took grave exception to an answer received to a parliamentary question tabled inquiring about the Minister&rsquo;s intention to take action following examination of Garda papers by a senior counsel. The reply stated the Minister was examining the matter. This answer displays the usual contempt for questions from Members of this House. The following morning, the details sought in my question appeared in great detail on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>. There was no problem leaking this to <i>The Irish Times</i> but these details could not be provided to me. This follows a pattern in this case. The <i>Evening Herald</i> has more success getting details from the Minister than Members of this House have when they table parliamentary questions. This is not the manner in which to treat D&aacute;il procedures, nor is it the way to treat elected Members of this House when they table questions of importance.</P>
      <P>I refer to a recent case in my constituency in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal of increased detention powers. I know the family of the late Terence Wheelock, who died tragically following his detention in a Garda cell. I do not wish to rush to judgment but changes must be introduced to ensure there is absolute transparency when a prisoner sustains fatal or serious injuries in a Garda cell.</P>
      <P>That Mr. Wheelock sustained serious injuries in a Garda cell is not disputed, the manner in which he sustained them is. Why were detailed medical findings not released to the family and its legal representatives? This was the entitlement of the family and it would help clear the air. Instead, questions about this case are mounting.</P><Col N="1196"/>
      <P>Why was the scene of the fatal injuries not treated with the same care as a crime scene, given that he died from injuries in the cell? I do not suggest a crime took place, nor do I make any judgments on the matter. The man sustained serious injuries and subsequently died and a Garda investigation is now complete, with findings to be sent to the Minister. Why was the scene not preserved pending the outcome of the investigation? It is extraordinary. Critical items in the cell were relocated and the cell was swept clean. It was swept clean as methodically as the Provisional IRA cleaned up the scene at the bar in Belfast after murdering Robert McCartney. I am not comparing the two events but why was this done, thereby contributing to the mounting disquiet about the case? The scene of the fatal injuries was not preserved pending completion of the investigation, thereby contributing to the fears of the family.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter I was told the cell had to be prepared for other prisoners and the garda&iacute; wanted to avoid hazards for other prisoners. We are so short of Garda cells that we could not keep one Garda cell closed until an investigation was completed. The Garda authorities took the decision to clean and renovate the cell, relocating items critical to the determination of the cause of injuries sustained by the young man. We have not heard from the Minister on the results of the Garda investigation yet he is pressing ahead with measures to increase detention powers. That is not acceptable. Only when the safeguards are in place should the Minister extend hours of detention where it is reasonable and necessary.</P>
      <P>I will refer to some other measures, many of which are not in the Bill, a point made by Deputy Joe Higgins, but will be added to it. That is not the best way to stimulate debate. I note, for example, that there will be provision to strengthen sentencing for drugs trafficking. That is something for which people throughout the area I represent have been calling with very good reason, given the devastation drugs has caused in my constituency.</P>
      <P>In that context, in recent weeks we have seen the re-emergence of heroin in flats complexes and areas of the north inner city where garda&iacute; have made significant seizures of heroin. These areas were devastated by heroin in the 1980s and 1990s and we all hope we will not have a repetition of that in the area in the next year or two but the reality is that heroin has re-emerged, and the evidence exists in Garda seizures.</P>
      <P>Even more alarming are the recent seizures, at least five or six, of crack cocaine in a variety of locations but concentrated in the north city area of Dublin Central. That is largely within a section of the Nigerian community but we all agree that crack cocaine is something we can do without. I have been critical of the Garda drugs strategy in <Col N="1197"/>the past but in this instance the Garda drugs unit in Store Street has been very active and successful. I hope that will continue.</P>
      <P>In that context, we all accept that the ten-year mandatory sentence provision has fallen flat on its face. I argued at the time that it should have been specifically focused on heroin because that would have put it up to the Judiciary to implement it where appropriate. A training course for some members of the Judiciary, perhaps even an in-service training course where they would have to spend some time in communities scourged by drugs, might be more productive than new sentencing provisions.</P>
      <P>On the Minister&rsquo;s proposal for new provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, there is no doubt in my mind that a great many people in some urban communities are increasingly frustrated and infuriated by anti-social activities from out-of-control gangs of youths. I was at a meeting in part of my constituency in the Cabra area last night where the community is making efforts, through a community policing forum, to confront that issue. I am involved in a community policing forum in the north inner city that is equally active on this issue and many other issues in the community.</P>
      <P>People who live in disadvantaged areas are probably far more conscious of anti-social activities than anyone else because they usually bear the brunt of them. Laneways, street junctions, open areas and, ironically, even playgrounds can be the worst locations, particularly at night. In many instances the elderly and more vulnerable people living alone are fearful of even going out at night. A good deal can be done about that problem but the issue is not helped by the scarcity of community garda&iacute; locally, despite the Government&rsquo;s often quoted promise of the extra 2,000 garda&iacute; that did not materialise. Even where garda&iacute; are present, they say this is a difficult issue to handle. I have been involved in discussions with them on many occasions and they appear not to have any effective strategy or any strategy in mind to confront this issue. We hear constant complaints from residents that when the Garda is called a patrol car eventually arrives, circles the area, drives off and there is no redress for the people living there who are left with the intimidation and harassment.</P>
      <P>In my experience it is usually only in areas where there is an active and strong residents group or a community policing forum made up of the residents, the garda&iacute;, the city council and so on that the Garda is called to account, the resources put in place and some attempt made to tackle the problem. Even then, garda&iacute; claim their powers are limited when those involved are not adults. The result is that a small number of out-of-control youths can cause havoc in an area. Against that background, in theory at least, the ASBOs would appear to have a part to play but <Col N="1198"/>the difficulty is how they are utilised by individual garda&iacute;, that is if the garda&iacute; are present in the first place or available in sufficient numbers on the ground to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>There will be dangers in the use of ASBOs if it is in the absence of better Garda training and a coherent strategy when dealing with the anti-social activities of teenagers in particular. As far as I am concerned, the ASBOs are not the answer but they may be a small part of the answer. More is required and sufficient numbers of garda&iacute; working in the community and providing a presence when they are needed must be the starting point. We must have accountability but we will only have that if we have organised and well run community policing fora in areas. It is in the areas where there is a partnership between the community, the garda&iacute; and the local authority that these issues can begin to be addressed. In the absence of that type of action, the ASBOs will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a good and lengthy debate on the Bill and I thank all Deputies who contributed. Although there are differences in emphasis from different sides of the House, I am pleased to note that there is broad agreement on the need to update our law to provide a more effective response to modern crime.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As the Minister, Deputy McDowell, said last February when presenting the Bill, it is an important legislative proposal. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. The provisions of the Bill get the balance right between effective State powers and guarantees concerning fundamental rights and respect for the rule of law.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to ensure that the Bill brings as much added legislative value as possible to the fight against crime. He therefore intends to bring forward some additional proposals by way of amendments to the Bill during its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>It will be obvious from his approach that the Minister intends the Bill to reflect contemporary needs fully. It includes a provision to deal with participation in organised criminal gangs in addition to provisions to strengthen the existing sentencing provisions for drug trafficking and firearms offences. Its provisions also include a drug offenders register and new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners and possession of an article with intent to commit certain offences. The Bill will also allow for the electronic monitoring of offenders. New provisions will allow courts to suspend, partially suspend or adjourn sentences on conditions which will motivate the offender to <Col N="1199"/>stay away from crime or deal with issues giving rise to offending. The Bill also includes new provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour in addition to proposals for the establishment of a criminal law codification advisory group which will advise on the drawing up of a criminal code and monitor its implementation.</P>
      <P>Other provisions include a new offence relating to attacks on emergency workers, a provision to clarify the jurisdiction of District Court judges in the issuing of warrants and a provision to clarify the meaning of the word &ldquo;torture&rdquo; as defined in the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000. The need for the latter provision arises from a judicial review application on a deportation matter. The Bill will also include proposals to tackle the illegal use of fireworks. Further amendments to the Firearms Acts will address matters arising from recent court judgments on the process of certification for the possession, use and carriage of firearms and ammunition, and the penalties for firearms offences.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to give effect, by way of amendment to this Bill, to one of the key recommendations in the Ferns inquiry report, namely, the creation of a new criminal offence of engaging in conduct that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child or failing to take reasonable steps to alleviate such risk. The amendments the Minister will propose will necessitate a change to the Long Title of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the Minister presented an outline of his proposals on these matters to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on 7 September to inform them more fully of his intentions as well as giving members of the joint committee an opportunity to raise matters with him which they considered needed to be addressed in the Bill. The Minister intends to bring these proposals to Government shortly and, subject to the approval of his Cabinet colleagues, will send them without delay to the Human Rights Commission and the joint committee.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, expects to bring proposals to Government in the near future to amend the Children Act 2001 to provide for anti-social behaviour orders for children and to secure the implementation of the Act. The intention is to provide for these amendments to the 2001 Act by way of amendment to this Bill. The Minister will propose these amendments to this Bill to optimise the opportunities in this legislation to ensure the maximum protection for our citizens. This approach is being adopted to ensure that this legislation can be utilised fully for maximum protection against crime. Deputies will appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s concern in this respect and, consequently, their full co-operation is being sought.</P><Col N="1200"/>
      <P>Recently, the Minister published the latest provisional crime statistics furnished by the Garda Commissioner. While the year-on-year statistics show a continued decrease in the incidence of headline crime, the Minister is concerned about the increase of 0.4% in the first three quarters of 2005 compared with the same period last year as well as the 5.5% increase in figures for the third quarter of this year compared with the same quarter last year. We must all continue our efforts to combat incidents of crime. The Bill is part of the answer to the challenges posed by crime in our communities.</P>
      <P>Additional legislative provisions can only ever be part of the answer. A well resourced police force is critical and in this regard I highlight that the Garda budget, at more than &euro;1.1 billion for this year, is greater than it has ever been. Ministers will continue to fight for increased resources. Furthermore, the strength of the force has reached a historic high and is rapidly expanding to its target, approved by the Government last year, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the proposals in this Bill, the Minister has been conscious of the importance of balancing the rights of the individual with the rights of society as a whole. In this respect, he has had regard to the protections of our the Constitution and the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, the Minister sought and was glad to receive the observations of the Human Rights Commission. He has taken these into account in as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Hand in hand with the availability of extra Garda powers such as those provided by the Bill, there must be a mechanism for independent supervision of how these powers are exercised. The legislation must be seen against the introduction of the national scheme providing for the audio-visual recording of interviews with persons detained in Garda custody under certain detention provisions, which will include those proposed in the legislation when enacted.</P>
      <P>The Bill must also be seen in the context of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. That legislation, which comprehensively reforms the law governing the force, will establish the Garda ombudsman commission to investigate independently complaints or allegations of wrongdoing. The Act will also establish the Garda inspectorate which will assess independently the effectiveness and efficiency of Garda practices and procedures and benchmark them against best performance internationally. The Minister will proceed with the establishment of these bodies in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>On the proposals for a comprehensive reform of the law concerning firearms, section 30 of the Bill provides for the secure custody of firearms and requires all applicants for firearms certificates to satisfy the Garda superintendent to whom the application is made that they have pro<Col N="1201"/>vided secure accommodation for the firearms. A number of Deputies raised concerns about making provision for this in the Bill. They also expressed the view that a wider and more comprehensive range of amendments to the Firearms Acts are required which should be included in a more comprehensive firearms Bill. The Minister is proposing a wider range of amendments to the Firearms Acts which will form a separate and distinct part of the Bill and which will encompass many of the issues raised by Deputies in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>Before briefly outlining the proposals which it is intended to bring forward on Committee Stage, I thank the many sporting organisations involved in shooting, particularly the National Association of Regional Game Councils and the Shooting Sports Association of Ireland. They have engaged constructively with the Department in the development of a number of these new proposals. Over the years, members of all these shooting organisations have demonstrated an extremely responsible approach to their sport. Their excellent safety record in the handling and use of firearms bears testimony to this fact.</P>
      <P>Government amendments on Committee Stage will insert a new Part in the Bill to deal with a series of provisions amending the Firearms Acts 1925-2000. The proposed amendments also involve moving the present section 30 to this new Part. The new provisions will allow the Minister to deem certain firearms as restricted by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm. Any person wishing to obtain a certificate for a restricted weapon must in future apply to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The new provisions will also increase fines and penalties relating to offences generally under the Firearms Acts as well as creating mandatory minimum sentences of between five and ten years for certain firearms offences. These offences include possession of a firearm in suspicious cir<Col N="1202"/>cumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest. In addition, the new provisions introduce a new offence of modifying a firearm, such as shortening the barrel of a shotgun, converting a de-activated or replica firearm into a live firearm, modifying a firearm to fully automatic and increasing the calibre of a firearm.</P>
      <P>The new provisions provide for decisions on firearms certificates to be issued within a minimum statutory period, introduce a statutory right of appeal to the District Court of decisions on certificates, introduce a new type of certificate which will allow young persons to be trained in the use of firearms for sporting purposes, introduce a new power for the Garda Commissioner to make guidelines or guidance notes for the uniform administration of the Act, and provide for the authorisation of rifle and pistol clubs and shooting ranges.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms who are not in compliance with the legal requirements to regularise their position and thus enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to concentrate on more serious offenders.</P>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage. The Minister will reflect on this debate further and if he considers it appropriate to bring forward amendments to deal with any of the issues raised, he will do so. The Minister has heard a number of contributions and the points made by other Members will be brought to his attention. I commend the legislation on which I accept there are different views. I believe the enactment of the legislation will ultimately be for the betterment of society.</P>

	<P>I call Deputy Joe Higgins, who has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said in his Second Stage contribution that he would introduce a managed economic migration policy. The Bill certainly does not represent migration policy &mdash; in no sense can it be considered as such. It is a work permits Bill making some extra provisions, one or two of which I welcome, but it falls far short of being a comprehensive migration Bill providing for migrants entering Irish society and making a new life here.</P>
      <P>When the Minister addressed the detail of the Bill, it was quite clear he was saying it is a revamped work permits policy. He said there are three pillars to the Bill, the first of which is the <Col N="1205"/>establishment for the first time in Ireland of a green card for occupations where there are skills shortages. He stated this will be for a restricted list of occupations in the annual salary range from &euro;30,000 to &euro;60,000 and a more extensive list of occupations in the annual salary range above &euro;60,000. To refer to the system as a green card system is entirely misleading. The Irish experience of a green card system is that which operates in the United States from which tens of thousands of our people have benefited. Unfortunately, there are also tens of thousands of Irish on the streets of Boston, New York and Chicago, illegally, and that is a matter of concern to me. Those who received a green card could make a new life on the same basis as American citizens or any other residents in the United States. The Employment Permits Bill, however, does not make the same provision. It is unfair, incorrect and misleading to make claims for the Bill that do not stand up.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The first pillar of the Bill identified by the Minister, namely, the special provision for workers earning more than &euro;60,000 a year and between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000, raises serious ethical issues about the philosophy behind this provision. Those migrants, particularly those in the &euro;60,000 plus group, have unlimited freedom to come here and take up job opportunities that would command an annual salary at that level. The Minister said in his opening speech that high pay is a reasonable proxy for high skills. He also said this provision addresses a high level and strategic skills shortage. This is completely different from the experience in the United States.</P>
      <P>As I prepared my remarks on the Bill and read its provisions and the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I recalled the poem, &ldquo;The New Colossus&rdquo;, by Emma Lazarus, inscribed on a bronze plaque near the Statue of Liberty. The all-embracing welcome inherent in this poem is no longer the case in the United States. In the 1800s, however, the situation was different, as Irish people and the millions of others who migrated to America were grievously exploited. When the tragic events unfolded recently in New Orleans I found that in the 1800s thousands of Irish workers perished from disease and abuse while constructing the city. In the poem the voice of the statue says:</P>
      <P LI="1">Give me your tired, your poor,</P>
      <P LI="1">Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,</P>
      <P LI="1">The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</P>
      <P LI="1">Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,</P>
      <P LI="1">I lift my lamp beside the golden door!</P>
      <P FLI="0">In this provision, restricted to highly skilled people, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment effectively says to the poor coun<Col N="1206"/>tries outside Europe: &ldquo;Keep your tired, your poor and your huddled masses but give us those who are highly qualified and skilled, your surgeons, specialist doctors, nurses, computer and engineering experts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This poses an ethical problem because the Government has for some years had a consistent policy of poaching skilled people from caring and other professions in countries regarded as the Third World or bordering thereon. The poor in those countries desperately need these professionals. Now one of the richest countries in Europe is taking these skilled people from poorer countries and using them to enhance the wealth of its society without having paid for their education. This provision copperfastens the ethical problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes some welcome changes for those workers earning less than &euro;30,000 a year. It gives them a greater degree of freedom because once the worker has a work permit, he or she will be able to change employments and will not be tied to one boss as at present. That is welcome as far as it goes but it does not go very far. Many questions arise because we have often pointed out the extent of migrant workers&rsquo; dependency on the boss who brings them here under the current system.</P>
      <P>In the new system it costs &euro;1,000 for an employer to take on a migrant worker on a two-year contract. Under what conditions will that migrant worker be able to move to another employer? Knowing the nature of the capitalist I cannot see a boss forking out &euro;1,000 only to see his or her employee moving to another employer after four weeks. The Minister says employers may not seek remuneration for that &euro;1,000 but there is a contradiction in this. I hope I can be enlightened on how it is proposed to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>The overall policy by which the Government seeks to cream the best educated and most skilful people from poor countries and excludes other categories of working people from those societies is fundamentally unethical, unjust and discriminatory.</P>
      <P>The other pillar of this Bill, according to the Minister, is to strengthen the rights and protection of migrant workers. I strongly endorse that aspiration but am not convinced the Bill provides for a comprehensive strengthening of rights and protection.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>Major abuse is taking place in the economy in the employment of migrant labour and it has been growing apace. The proposal by Irish Ferries to replace 543 workers on trade union rates of pay and conditions with semi-bonded migrant labour on disgusting rates of pay and conditions shocked because it was so blatant. The company felt sufficiently emboldened to come out in front of the world and make this shocking proposal, but what it represents has been going on in society for a con<Col N="1207"/>siderable number of years in many areas of employment, especially in the construction, meat and hospitality industries to name but three.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>What we outlined in the institutionalised exploitation machine represented by Gama merely reflected what was going on, although not to the same degree of exploitation, in many other sectors of construction and in many other companies. Now, those who are most abused are not from outside the EU but are eastern European workers. They would not be on the Gama pay rates of &euro;8 per hour. They could be getting &euro;8 or &euro;9 per hour but significantly less than the registered agreement rates in the construction industry. Construction bosses abuse vulnerable migrant labour to undercut Irish workers and other migrant workers who insist on a trade union rate, and they are also worsening conditions. If that trend is not stopped, a serious future is promised in relations between working people in this State against a background of a recession in the economy.</P>
      <P>While growth rates are at present levels, the economy can absorb most of the labour offered along with workers in employment who feel they are undercut and under threat. However, in a recession when thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of jobs are cut, for example, in the construction industry, the basis is then laid for a vicious struggle over wage rates and jobs as ruthless employers seek to continue to employ exploited labour and employ more of it if there are higher unemployment levels in society rather than employ labour which insists on trade union rates of pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>That is a real danger and the Government carries a heavy responsibility in the area. I am not convinced of the bona fides of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government in any sense because it is part of the current EU neoliberal consensus which wants to squeeze more productivity out of workers, meaning greater exploitation of workers, and which sought the opportunity for employers to be able to employ cheaper labour than workers on the established trade union rates of pay.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment referred to the increase in the number of inspectors. I welcome that but the numbers should be much greater. The inspectors investigate what is brought to their attention, complaints made and so on. When we made public the Gama scandal, the work done by inspectors and the dedication they brought to it as public servants was impressive. However, a broader and more radical approach is now needed. I call for an investigation and research into targeted industries to see what levels of exploitation and abuse exist there.</P>
      <P>There is a particular level of organised exploitation in the meat industry and factories and an <Col N="1208"/>undercutting of decent rates of pay and conditions. I would like to see former meat workers from those factories interviewed. They could be Irish or migrant workers who previously worked for trade union rates and refused to work for less. They now say they cannot find work in Irish meat factories at trade union rates because of the deliberate employment of migrant workers to undercut a decent rate of pay and decent conditions.</P>
      <P>The trade unions have a critical role in all this. I was critical of elements of the trade union movement in allowing the Gama scandal to exist for four years. However, when a senior SIPTU official and the union took responsibility for the strike and the negotiations, directed by the workers&rsquo; own Turkish strike committee, that became a crucial factor in winning important concessions. In following up on the Gama sites to ensure that all the workers are getting their proper rates and conditions, SIPTU is playing a very important role.</P>
      <P>I now want the trade union movement to form an A-team to go into the economy and organise migrant workers everywhere so that exploited labour cannot be used in any job, and to follow the example of the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World, in the earlier part of this century in America who did excellent work among migrant workers by bringing them in from the fringes where they were exploited and welding them together with the general workforce. That is what we need as an answer to the employers and those would ruthlessly exploit the vulnerable, particularly the migrant workers in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Joe Higgins on the stand he took for migrant workers in this country and on how he fought for them. We talked in this House for a long time about the abuse of migrant workers in this country. We are the greatest hypocrites in the world. There is no Member of this House who has not had a relative who had to go abroad, either to England, America or Australia. It is not too many years ago in this country that we had judges offering people before the courts the choice between Australia and jail. At that time we were glad to get rid of as many people as possible from this country. It is not long since we had Ministers in this House saying that it was good and important for the country to get as many people as possible out of this State because we could not provide them with employment.</P>
      <P>The tide has turned. I never thought we would see in this country, particularly in my county of Mayo, so many workers taking up work which our people will not do. Deputy Joe Higgins has previously pointed out in this House that migrant workers must be protected. We are great in this House for bringing in wonderful legislation but the problem is that we do no more than bring it <Col N="1209"/>in. We have nobody to monitor it. The only time legislation is monitored in this House and there are sufficient people to deal with it is when there is money to be collected for the Government. In that case, sufficient staff will be put in place.</P>
      <P>The most important part of this Bill relates to the protection of workers, especially migrant workers. There is no point in pretending they are not being used and abused in this country. Shame on the employers involved. They should look back to our past when many Irish people took up menial jobs in America and were used and abused there. Irish people built roads in America but now Irish immigrants to that country are refused driving licences. We look for protection for our illegal emigrants in America and elsewhere but we are not prepared to protect people who come to this country to take up employment.</P>
      <P>For three years, a Latvian woman worked in my town who saved money, returned home twice each year and presented no burden to the State. She made an application to bring her husband and ten year old child to Ireland because she could no longer remain apart from them. She did not want the State to pay for them but she was refused on the basis she did not have sufficient money to support them. Unlike many Irish people who squander money on alcohol and cigarettes, she worked hard and saved. However, she had to leave the country because the family could not remain here. The hotel for which she worked was upset to lose her because she was a good worker.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this legislation to support people who are willing to work rather than look for social welfare and who want to live in this country with their families. The woman&rsquo;s husband would have easily found employment and would not have been a burden on the State. All the couple wanted was a work permit or a visa to allow the husband come here but we would not provide either. We are the most hypocritical country in the world. We want everybody to look after us but are not prepared to help these people. We should accept a proportion of the illegal immigrants that we deport every day. Appropriate legislation should be introduced to ensure such people are protected.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the provisions in this Bill on work permits, which should be given to the employee rather than the employer so that, if the former is unhappy or is sought by another company, he or she will have the opportunity to move on. Otherwise, it is like putting these people in jail because the employer can retain the permit and use the threat of deportation to force the employee to work unsuitable hours. That matter should have been addressed.</P>
      <P>If an immigrant receives six consecutive work permits while working for the same employer, he or she can then apply for citizenship. This requirement should be reduced to three years <Col N="1210"/>because an employee will have established a record and paid PRSI and tax during that period and will have proved that he or she is prepared to remain in this country.</P>
      <P>What are we going to do to protect migrant workers? Will we employ more inspectors and give them more powers to enter places of employment to ensure employees are treated appropriately? The transport industry abuses migrant workers by making them drive vehicles for more hours than is legal. Employers falsely advise drivers that they will be protected if they are caught. I hope the inspectorate will investigate this area.</P>
      <P>People are coming to this country who want to make a living and they should be protected. However, rather than protect people, this Bill will make it more difficult to work here. That should not be the case because while the population is increasing, insufficient Irish people are prepared to work in certain sectors, such as the services industry. We should be delighted that people want to work here, many of whom are well educated but cannot find work in their own countries. It is good for the country.</P>
      <P>What will we do in terms of inspectors? Will we appoint more people and give them greater powers? Will they ensure that migrant workers are protected? Deputy Joe Higgins correctly noted that the events with regard to Gama were scandalous. Similar situations exist that we do not know about. That company came here from Turkey and abused the Irish system and did not pay its workers proper wages until the courts dealt with the issue. I hope we will never allow such a situation to develop again. We should remember the treatment abroad of Irish workers. We were not able to resolve their problems. It would be terrible if we allowed employers to bring people to Ireland on work permits and then abuse them.</P>
      <P>An information document should be given to migrant workers alongside their work permit which would advise them where to make a complaint if they are abused or their rights are not met. Such a provision should be introduced on Committee Stage. Some migrant workers have poor English and require time to become accustomed to Ireland. It would not cost a fortune to provide information to them.</P>
      <P>Irish employers threaten to hire workers from abroad to reduce their wage costs. While unemployment was once a significant issue in this country, we are now told there is almost full employment. Workplaces in which large numbers of migrant workers are employed should be inspected on a regular basis to enforce appropriate pay levels and conditions and to ensure workers are not used as an excuse. This year, a number of complaints were heard in Westport and other tourism destinations in terms of difficulties in finding summer work.</P><Col N="1211"/>
      <P>The migrant workers employed in hotels in Westport are settled in the community and are good workers. They go home on a regular basis and send as much money as possible back to their families in the same way as Irish people working abroad did in the 1930s and 1940s prior to the establishment of the European Union. The money that came from Irish people working in America and Britain kept this country alive, and these people are doing that now in respect of their countries. I hope we can protect these workers better than Irish workers were protected in America and Britain in the past and that we have learnt from our past mistakes. I hope that legislation will be introduced to deal with illegal immigrants. We cannot be hypocritical with Members travelling to America to try to look after our own and forgetting about looking after illegal immigrants living here.</P>
      <P>We are facing a general election and it will not be long before some Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers use the issue of immigrants to try to get themselves elected. There used to be the green card issue and now the issue is foreign workers and illegal immigrants coming to live in this country. If people speak out of turn in that context, I hope they will be dealt with by the Taoiseach and that legislation will be in place to deal with such racists. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot try to get our people in America protected when people who come into this country are not protected. I hope that legislation will be introduced in future to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate on this legislation which is long overdue. Originally it was to be published prior to Easter 2003 but it not published until June of this year. It was so long in gestation that I expected it to be a much more comprehensive and radical Bill. I am disappointed with it, particularly with the lack of integration and connectivity between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The issues that give rise to this Bill are deeply connected to the remit of both Departments. I refer to issues of work permits, naturalisation, citizenship, asylum and visas. The Bill does little or nothing to provide for integration between the two Departments in dealing these issues.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to the background to this Bill. One is the population change in recent years. There has been an increase in the population and a further increase is forecast. The Central Statistics Office indicated that during the period up to 2030 our population will grow from 4 million to 5.5 million. Births are outstripping deaths by approximately 31,000 on an annual basis. We have approximately 63,000 births and approximately 32,000 deaths. Therefore, there is <Col N="1212"/>a natural increase in the population annually. The make-up of the population is changing. Migrants have moved here and many Irish people have returned home in recent years. Asylum seekers and, more recently, migrants from the new EU member states, particularly eastern European countries, have moved here. We now have a workforce of approximately 2 million.</P>
      <P>Another aspect, which is as important if not more so, to the background to this legislation and the area with which it deals is that a particular economic philosophy is underpinning the situation that is arising. I refer to the race to the bottom for wages and conditions and profit being the motive for everything. Other speakers would have called this neoliberalism but Irish people would probably know it much better as Thatcherism. It might be more appropriate if we called it rampant capitalism. What is emerging is being promoted not only here but at EU level. It is a race to bottom to minimise wages, undermine conditions and bring all employment and wages to the lowest common denominator. That is a phenomenon we have seen over recent years in this country and is one that is supported by various agencies both here and at EU level.</P>
      <P>Last year we saw from where that was coming. The services directive introduced by the European Commission last year was the basis for that particular philosophy whereby the Commission wanted to ensure that companies, particularly those from eastern European countries, could operate in other European countries like Ireland and the more advanced countries on the basis of wages and conditions that existed in their own countries. That is fundamentally immoral and is a policy which, if continued with, can only lead to the undermining of wages, conditions and, ultimately, society in this and other European countries.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, our European Commissioner is at the heart of this policy and even in today&rsquo;s newspapers we see that he is at the forefront of that policy. <i>The Irish Times</i> today states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Mr. McCreevy was summoned, with commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, to the parliament yesterday to explain comments he made during a recent visit to Sweden about a labour dispute, which has been referred to the European courts by the Swedish labour court.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What did Mr. McCreevy say?</P>
      <P LI="1">[He] told the European Parliament that he should not have to justify remarks he made in relation a legal dispute between the Swedish government and a Latvian construction company over wage agreements.</P>
      <P FLI="0">
        <i>The Irish Times</i> regarded it as sufficiently important to have a leader article on it, the first few lines of which states:</P><Col N="1213"/>
      <P LI="1">Charlie McCreevy has been in the news around Europe because of his remarks on the EU&rsquo;s internal market and how it relates to labour market practices in Sweden. He has defended a Latvian building company&rsquo;s case in that it was not obliged to pay Swedish pay rates on a contract in the town of Vaxholm. The company was forced to withdraw after it was picketed by Swedish trade unions.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to those trade unionists.</P>
      <P>That is the type of economic philosophy being handed down from Europe and, unfortunately, it is being bought into here. The reaction of IBEC to the situation at Irish Ferries, which wants to dismiss 543 Irish workers and replace them with what is effectively slave labour, is an indication of that philosophy. IBEC could not find the courage to oppose that development and to take its constituent company to task on it. Furthermore, a number of economic commentators, one in particular, said on a radio programme recently that the Irish Ferries situation is a good development. That was said by a well known economic commentator. Unfortunately, the Labour Court added to this situation when it recently agreed a deal that allowed Irish Ferries to introduce the same conditions on the <i>MV Normandy</i> and our Department funded redundancy payments on the back of that recommendation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is a fundamentally flawed economic philosophy driving the situation behind the subjects we are discussing that can only lead to major difficulties in the future if it is not stopped. An element of that economic philosophy is privatisation. Irish Ferries is a good example as it was a State company that was privatised and is now being driven by its management to a position whereby it wants to disregard its Irish workers and employ eastern European labour at a fraction of the current wages and conditions of employment. I think I heard the Taoiseach say this morning that there was a difficulty in challenging this issue and particularly the matter of flags of convenience because of some constitutional problem. If there is a constitutional problem, the Government should put a referendum to the people to ensure it is dealt with.</P>
      <P>This race to the bottom goes to the core of society and will do serious and irreparable damage to it if it is not dealt with. This issue is driven at EU and national levels by various agencies. It is a four-pronged attack where migrant workers within the State are abused and used to drive down wages and conditions of employment which in turn abuses them and their families, the services directive is used to allow eastern European countries to ply their trade in this and other European countries at rates of pay and conditions of employment that exist in those countries, and there are the issues of privatisation and flags of convenience.</P><Col N="1214"/>
      <P>No matter what legislation is introduced, even if it is Rolls Royce legislation, it is of little or no value if there is not proper enforcement and monitoring. Unfortunately that has been the case in the past and continues to be the case. For example, the labour inspectorate does a good job within the resources available and when allowed. I concur with Deputy Joe Higgins who said that when the problem at Gama was brought to their attention, they dealt with it in an efficient and upfront manner. However, the number of labour inspectors is small, being 31 at the last count, while a minimum of 100 are needed.</P>
      <P>In recent years sufficient resources have not been made available to that inspectorate and, as a result, the inspectorate is not as active as it should be. In 2002 there were 8,323 inspections but in 2004 the number had fallen to 5,160, a reduction of more than 3,000 in a two-year period. In the same period there were 25 prosecutions in 2002 and only 14 in 2004. I ask the Minister to make available sufficient resources to the labour inspectorate to ensure it can do its job. Given our diverse workforce of 2 million people, a properly resourced labour inspectorate is essential to ensure workers, migrant or Irish, are not abused. The number of cases being brought to the Labour Court is such that it is becoming clogged.</P>
      <P>There is another element relating to the labour inspectorate, the exploitation of workers and the benefit to companies over other genuine companies. In the Gama case there was the exploitation of the Turkish workers who worked long hours for small wages which were siphoned into accounts in European banks. Thankfully that issue has been dealt with. However, there are other knock-on effects in companies like Gama. I refer to the PRSI exemption which allows companies such as Gama, which has abused its workforce, to quote for work and undercut Irish and non-Irish employers for public service contracts. While Gama Construction was being investigated by the labour inspectorate, it contracted for the Castleblayney bypass and was successful, perhaps on the basis of the PRSI exemption which gives it a 2% to 3% advantage over other companies. That PRSI exemption is neither fair nor reasonable and should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Employers refer to this exemption. At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business the electrical contractors indicated that the labour inspectorate did not have sufficient resources to monitor its industry and they were fearful of being undercut by companies which were not paying the rate for the job and were, therefore, winning contracts on an unfair basis.</P>
      <P>I wish to address a related issue, that is, access to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I refer specifically to the case of Stefan Dan Alexiuc, a Romanian constituent, who has been working in Carrick-on-Suir, County <Col N="1215"/>Tipperary, for more than four years and has a work permit. He applied for a D visa for his wife to bring her here and be together as a family but was refused by the Department. He has appealed that refusal and has again been refused. The information from the Department is scant. He has been refused on financial and relationship grounds. The Department will not tell him or me what that means and it is almost impossible to get through to the Department. I understand it is available to deal with queries for two hours on two days per week. I ask the Minister to speak with her Cabinet colleague and ask that at least an Oireachtas Member inquiry line be made available to Members inquiring about cases.</P>
      <P>Stefan Dan Alexiuc has been working for four years in Carrick-on-Suir and earns between &euro;400 and &euro;500 per week. In his letter to me he said:</P>
      <P LI="1">I enclose a few of my last payslips. I also have a Bank of Ireland credit card with a &euro;2,000 limit. The rent that I pay is &euro;40 a week, so I would say that I can support financially both my wife and I. Actually, I am already supporting a child from a less developed country, Vietnam, thanks to Action Aid.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I come across cases such as this on a regular basis, as I am sure do other Members of the House. The Department should have a more open manner in dealing with them. Members of the Oireachtas in particular should have more open access to the Department.</P>
      <P>I refer to the case of Jehosh Tunde Adekiyesi who is married and has been in Ireland and at work since 1998. He has bought a house here through a local authority loan. He recently received a deportation order. I ask the Minister to look into that case.</P>
      <P>The background to this Bill and the economic philosophy driving the process is fundamentally flawed and needs to be changed. While the Bill will be of some assistance to workers, particularly migrant workers, it is not the legislation I would like to have seen introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate which is long overdue. Like a number of Deputies who have already spoken, I deeply regret it took so long to publish this Bill which has been promised in every legislative programme going back as far as the spring of 2003. I am not sure why it took the Government so long to come up with this legislation which does little more than put the current regime on a statutory footing. Those of us who wish to see substantive changes that will provide real protection for migrant workers must, unfortunately, continue to wait because they are not clearly provided for in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The present system is a two-tier system in which certain categories of migrant workers have considerably greater rights and freedoms than <Col N="1216"/>other categories. The Bill does nothing to change that. The right to change employer will still belong only to the workers in the top tier. Those in the bottom tier will still be bound to their employer. The Bill indicates the Minister&rsquo;s intention to retain categories of employment deemed ineligible for new work permits, which I regret. I know from the testimony of my constituents that this causes great difficulty for migrant workers as it makes it all but impossible for many of them to change jobs. I note that the Department&rsquo;s expert group on future skills needs and Forf&aacute;s have recommended that the &ldquo;ineligible&rdquo; designation be abolished. I hope the Minister will give that proposal the serious consideration it deserves.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation, only top-tier workers will have the right to avail of the new scheme which is being misleadingly referred to as a green card scheme. This is nothing like the green card system used in the United States and the Government and media should stop using this phraseology which is just confusing the public by giving them the sense of equivalence between the two when clearly no similarity exists. In the American system, &ldquo;green card&rdquo; is an informal term for the status which is officially called &ldquo;permanent residence&rdquo;. It is granted only once and it is permanent. It does not need to be renewed after a few years, as the scheme on offer here will.</P>
      <P>The lack of permanence is a real problem for migrant workers. Many have found it difficult to open bank accounts or take out mortgages because they could not prove to the bank&rsquo;s satisfaction that they would be here in a few years&rsquo; time. There is also a psychological factor which should be taken into account. I have spoken to many immigrants in my constituency who have conveyed to me their sense of insecurity and instability arising from their temporary status. It is as if there is a voice in the back of their head constantly reminding them of the uncertainty of their future. Under this legislation that uncertainty will remain.</P>
      <P>The American green card system has another fundamental difference in that it is not limited to workers in a certain category or above a certain income level, as this one is. It is doubtful that many of our emigrant relations, to whom reference was made earlier, could have qualified for a green card if the system mooted here had applied in the United States. The Minister stated in his opening remarks that the only eligible occupations will be those in a salary range above the average industrial wage and that most of the eligible occupations will involve salaries of twice the average industrial wage. This will exclude large numbers of migrant workers. The implication of such a policy is that workers earning below these levels are expendable and that their contribution to our economy and society is minimal. The truth is very different. We are reliant upon these <Col N="1217"/>workers, many of whom do jobs that few of us would be willing to do.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not address one of the issues of greatest concern to migrant workers, namely, whether they will be allowed to have their spouses and children with them in the State. The Minister has indicated that the present situation will continue in which workers must meet a certain income threshold before they can bring their families here. This is discriminatory and degrading. Workers on lower incomes are just as entitled to the care and companionship of their families. Furthermore, the Migration Policy Institute has identified the absence of provision for family reunification as one of the key factors encouraging illegal immigration. This policy therefore is also short-sighted and in the long run will only cause problems, not solve them.</P>
      <P>The Bill also fails to address the issue of employment rights for spouses of work permit holders. Again, the Minister has indicated that the present situation will continue in which only the spouses of top-tier employees may work without restriction. This policy is one of the reasons lower tier employees often cannot rise above the income threshold required to have their families with them. If their spouses were given the same rights as those of top-tier migrant workers, and there is no legitimate reason they should not be, this problem would arise much less often.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is not just the spouses of work permit holders who suffer under the present regime. I am increasingly hearing of the problems being faced by the non-national spouses of Irish citizens due to restrictions on their employment while their residency application is pending. I have recently tabled a number of questions on the subject to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because I have heard so often of the difficulties it causes. At present an application to remain in the State based upon marriage to an Irish citizen takes 16 to 18 months to be approved. During this time the non-national spouse cannot work without a work permit. A period of 16 to 18 months is too long for two people to live on one income in our economy. While I understand the concerns about fraudulent marriages and while other countries quite obviously have the same concerns, nonetheless many of them, including the US and Britain, allow spouses to work while their applications are being adjudicated.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Devins and McGuinness.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate this evening. The only aspect of the Opposition&rsquo;s motion that I can agree with is the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Pat Joe Walsh. However, I believe that a politically hostile motion is not the most appropriate format in which to express our sympathy.</P>
      <P>Last night I met 15 members of the Walsh family and found them understandably heartbroken at the sad, sudden and tragic loss of their uncle, brother and father on 14 October, in the early hours of the morning, at Monaghan General Hospital. They have many questions to which they want answers and I want answers too. That is why we have established an independent investigation of all of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Pat Joe Walsh, from the time he left Drogheda Hospital on 13 October to the time he died at 7.30 a.m. on Friday, 14 October. We want answers, not just for the family and the public, but to make sure that those that have responsibilities, whether political, medical or administrative, take those responsibilities seriously. I am told that we will have the report <Col N="1221"/>of the investigation within eight weeks and I very much look forward to receiving it, as do the family of Mr. Walsh.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal now with the political aspects of this motion. I suppose that it is a backhanded compliment to me that Opposition Members choose to judge me after 12 months as Minister for Health and Children.</P>

	<P>Their expectations of my performance were obviously great. I am sure their expectations were not just of me personally, but are the same as those they would have of any ministerial office holder, including their own. Therefore, I invite them to take any one year period when their own Ministers were in office, between 1993 and 1997, and to show us any lasting reforms that led to improvements in health care from a patient&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
      <P>Let us begin with Deputy Howlin, as Minister for Health in 1993. He got off to a very bad start, as Mr. Fergus Finlay reminded us in his book, <i>Snakes and Ladders</i>, on page 162&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Mr. Finlay writes, &ldquo;Brendan was the one who took the most persuading. He didn&rsquo;t want to be Minister for Health....Dick had to tell him there was no other option, but he was the most reluctant Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>How was Deputy Howlin, as Minister, judged? We are told he &ldquo;lost his nerve&rdquo;, that he had &ldquo;simply made things worse.&rdquo; Who said that? Deputy McManus said it in the D&aacute;il on 31 March 1993, when he was only three months in office. She accused him of introducing greater inequalities and said, &ldquo;Any attempt to disguise this fact by the Minister is pure blabber&rdquo;. Always the bitter word. The party rosette may have changed, but the discordant song remains the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

	<P>When Deputy Howlin launched the health strategy, Deputy McManus told us it was &ldquo;a great disappointment&rdquo; that &ldquo;simply does not do the business&rdquo;. She went on, predictably, to say that &ldquo;It includes slavish concessions to private health care&rdquo;. That was on 4 May 1994. The same, transferable speech 12 years later. The Ministers may change, but Deputy McManus&rsquo;s words remain the same.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Noonan became Minister for Health in 1997, he invested £10 million in the waiting list initiative and the numbers on the list went up from 27,000 to 32,000.</P>
      <P>I am always happy to listen to constructive criticism and to suggestions from those who have suggestions to make. However, I am reluctant to take lectures from those who do not believe in collective Cabinet responsibility, who have no policy achievements, who are constantly carping and involved in negativity, who have never led, developed or implemented Government policy and who constantly make false claims.</P>
      <P>Let us now deal with those false claims. Deputy McManus tells us the number of hospital beds, per head is lower now than it was five years ago. Five years ago there were 12,612 beds. Now there are 13,707 beds, which represents over 1000 additional beds in that five year period. She told us that 480 acute beds were closed because the INO said they were closed. This is not so, as shown by the HSE. She says that the policy on medical cards for terminally ill patients has changed but it is the same policy that was implemented 30 years ago when the late Mr. Brendan Corish was Minister for Health. The Deputy said that treatments for patients by the national treatment purchase fund were cancelled. That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it was true. The T&aacute;naiste should stop misleading the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>She said there was a taxi fare of &euro;600 for a patient but she was wrong again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should get her facts right, at least. This is embarrassing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McManus has no policies. She is drifting along on flotsam policies, like the proposal for free GP cards for everybody, even the rich.</P>
      <P>Let us contrast the records on primary care and GP cards in particular. This year the Government has increased the income guidelines by 29%, the highest increase since 1974. What happened between 1993 and 1997? In 1993, there was an increase of £2, which is &euro;2.54, in 1994 the increase was £1 or &euro;1.27. When Democratic Left came into Government, the figure was £2, or &euro;2.54 and in 1997, it was £1.50, or &euro;1.91. In those five years, when the Labour Party was in Government, the <Col N="1223"/>increase was &euro;10.80, which is 11%. Since 1997, it has increased by 64% and last year by 29%.</P>
      <P>We have also changed the method of assessing people&rsquo;s entitlement to medical cards. We have moved to disposable income, where tax and PRSI are deducted from income, as are reasonable expenses on mortgage, child care, travel to work or rent. It is the single greatest innovation in 35 years, together with the introduction of the doctor-only card. I strongly believe in a tiered, graduated level of benefits, not an all-or-nothing system based on one means test.</P>
      <P>Deputies McManus and Rabbitte have described the doctor-only card as a yellow pack card. Let us see what they had to say about it on a different occasion. This is what Deputy McManus had to say to Deputy Howlin, the then Minister for Health, on 31 March 1993: &ldquo;If he had chosen to introduce a free GP service and let people pay for their drugs for the time being, it would have made some kind of sense&rdquo;. That is from the woman who is now pouring scorn and acid on my GP card, not because it is me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste promised medical cards but she did not deliver them. That is why she has GP cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>What of the Deputy&rsquo;s throw-away remarks on universal insurance, which would cost &euro;1 billion? She has now acknowledged that it could not be implemented in the lifetime of a single Government and Fine Gael has run away from that idea. At least Deputy Howlin delivered a health strategy in 1994. The deputy leader of his party has not delivered any policy on health since 2002.</P>
      <P>I am confident that we are making major progress in health reform. We have ended the incoherence of the health boards, though many of the problems and legacies of the plethora of bureaucracy that was our health board structure are still with us, as we have seen recently. We now have the HSE in place, which has its accountability clearly defined in legislation. The CEO of that organisation is not just the accounting officer but is also responsible, on a day to day basis, for the management of our health services. It is a sea change in health management which will make an enormous difference.</P>
      <P>The Opposition voted against the establishment of the HSE and Deputy McManus, earlier this year, called on me to postpone its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is not an end in itself. It is merely an enabler of change, reform, accountability and of the creation of a consistent and equitable health service for all our patients. We <Col N="1224"/>are only at the beginning of the journey but the signs are encouraging.</P>
      <P>I have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition to issue a political directive to the HSE, under section 10 of the Health Act, regarding surgical procedures at Monaghan General Hospital. Politics have bedevilled hospitals in this country for many years &mdash; party politics, medical politics and office politics. The only sure thing is that when politics comes first, patients come last. There will be no political directives from me interfering with the management of hospitals. I will not undermine the mandate given by the Oireachtas to the HSE to professionally run, in the interests of patient safety and care in each region, our hospital system.</P>
      <P>Accident and emergency has been a major pressure point for some time in the health service. Each day, on average, accident and emergency departments throughout the country see 3,400 patients. Thankfully, the vast majority of these patients are seen speedily and do not have to wait overnight on trolleys for admission to a hospital bed. There are many diverse factors that lead to overcrowding in accident and emergency units. There is no single solution to the difficulties. We need a wide range of initiatives to put right the problems which have been in accident and emergency departments for some time, which is what we are doing. We have, for example, gone to tender in the north side of Dublin for out-of-hours GP services, the first time this has happened. It will make a major impact on the accident and emergency departments in the Mater and Beaumont hospitals and, to a lesser extent, at Blanchardstown hospital. We have also bought long-term and step-down beds so that those who can be discharged from the acute hospital system can move to a more appropriate setting. A national hygiene audit, the first ever, has been completed and the results will be published. We will not sweep the results under the carpet because we need to know what the situation is in our hospitals if we are to achieve higher standards. We need base data. We have opened new accident and emergency units at Blanchardstown, Naas, Roscommon and Cork and shortly a new 25-bed unit will be open at the Mater Hospital in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The past year has been one of reform, breaking barriers to innovation and clearing away some of the ossified legacies of the past. It has been a once in a generation change in health management and accountability. It has been a year of major innovation in medical card benefits. It has been a year when the focus has been on the difficulties in accident and emergency. It has been a year when we sorted out the 29 year legal mess surrounding long-term charges, when we delivered a national policy on radiotherapy, when we delivered multi-annual funding for disability and when we have had new treatments, new beds and new invest<Col N="1225"/>ments. It has been an exciting year, but no one year can sort out our health services. What the one year can do is set us on the right road. That is the road we have taken and that will deliver results. It is the road that will ensure that Ireland has a world class health system.</P>

Wrong suggestions will be challenged but, above all, the people know the Government is committed to health reform and it will succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion concerning the health services and the current Minister for Health and Children. Like the Minister, I agree with the Opposition on just one aspect, that is, to express my deepest sympathy to the family of Mr. Pat Joe Walsh on his untimely and unnecessary death at Monaghan General Hospital. As has been stated, there is now an official inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death, and it is appropriate that objective comment should be delayed until the findings of that inquiry are available. However, I was absolutely appalled by the behaviour of some politicians who immediately after the tragic death of Mr. Walsh tried to turn his sad death into a political football. It is worth remembering that they did so in the absence of hard facts surrounding his death. Such actions are unwarranted and, in truth, do the political system more damage than good. It may achieve for the politician involved a measure of short-term gratification in the publicity stakes but as to ascertaining the underlying mistakes, it is of no use at all. Once the inquiry is finalised, it is important that corrective measures are put in place as soon as possible so that a totally unnecessary death such as that of Mr. Walsh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Deputy is out of order. Deputy Devins should be allowed to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on her achievements during her first year in office. She set out her stall quite clearly as to what she wants to achieve. I am vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and she attended the committee each time we asked her to do so. She has at all times been up-front and practical. One of the goals she set herself is to tackle the accident and emergency crisis. It is well recognised that a major help in ensuring accident and emergency units function efficiently is the presence of acute medical assessment units. In that regard, I ask the Minister to help expedite the establishment of such a unit at Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The use of units such as this in other hospitals in the State has been shown to be of great benefit in reducing the waiting times in accident and emergency. Sligo General Hospital staff have prepared an extremely cost-effective plan for the establishment of such a unit. I have no doubt that such a unit will be of great help in ensuring the efficient workings of the accident and emergency unit in that hospital.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it her priority to deal with the accident and emergency crisis and I commend her for the progress to date. I have no doubt that the speedy establishment of the acute medical unit in Sligo will be an important facility to complement the great work done there by the accident and emergency staff in dealing with the various medical and surgical problems presented to the unit. Will the Minister use her good offices to get that unit sanctioned as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Another unit which is of great interest to those living in the north west is the provision of radiotherapy services. This is an area about which I have spoken to the Minister previously and I know she will be meeting a delegation from the north-west region shortly to discuss the provision of such a radiotherapy unit. It is an issue on which there is great degree of cross-party support in the House. At the recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis in Killarney, a unanimous motion was passed requesting the establishment of such a radiotherapy unit.</P>
      <P>I look forward to discussing the issue more fully with the Minister in the near future and I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The previous Minister, Deputy Martin, introduced the reform package in regard to the health services. Any of us who deal with the issues at the coalface, particularly in regard to health, will be aware that it was the one area where reform was absolutely necessary. I commend the T&aacute;naiste since taking over the portfolio of Minister for Health and Children on the <Col N="1227"/>work she has done to date. She is to be commended for undertaking the difficult task ahead and for introducing the reforms. As Members on all sides of the House will be aware, previous Ministers always had to fight a political battle to effect change, not just party politics but politics within the whole medical area. This was seen through the health boards in the old system.</P>
      <P>If a swift change is to come about, it will only be by political co-operation. Far from tabling motions such as this, the Opposition would serve the system much better if it worked in close co-operation with the Minister to ensure the difficulties we all experience in the health services are overcome. There is no way round this issue. In any company that faces challenges in the commercial market, there is a need for everyone involved, workers and management alike, to co-operate and ensure the necessary reforms are introduced, put in place constructively and funded properly. It is only by doing so we can move forward in regard to the changes and services that will be necessary in the future. I say this as someone who has often complained and suggested change, whether in regard to the services provided in my constituency, the services that are available nationally or issues such as MRSA. I know the Minister has conducted that audit throughout the hospital. I want to draw attention to the many public meetings that have been held and the concerns expressed on the issue. I urge the Minister to undertake whatever change is necessary in the workplace to make people acknowledge the issue of MRSA and to assist and support those at the coal face delivering services to ensure patients are properly monitored and informed and, where necessary, receive the support necessary in their own homes because the issue is not being dealt with properly or constructively.</P>
      <P>If political parties work together, they will bring about the necessary change to ensure a proper health service. The co-operation of consultants and other professionals is also needed. St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Kilkenny has often been cited by all political parties as an example of best practice in the delivery of health services. It is in receipt of funding for its accident and emergency unit, outpatient facility and a proper stroke unit. That happened as a result of funding from the Department through the HSE and the co-operation of consultants and others working in the hospital and interested in achieving change.</P>
      <P>Funding is needed and when taxpayers invest &euro;12 billion of their hard earned money in the service, they want results. Value for money and appropriate change for patients will not happen until political parties recognise that the issue is not only about the Minister and the Opposition playing its role but about putting the patient first. The patient will be put first in the effort the Mini<Col N="1228"/>ster is making to introduce the substantial reform needed. The Government is committed to providing the funding required to make that happen and achieve reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government parties have had eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It has taken a long time to change the culture within the health service and to provide the capital funding needed. It will take more than Deputy McGrath to ensure that happens. The Minister is committed and she has the bottle to take on the Opposition and the medical profession to turn the health service around. It is in all our interests that this is done sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>I encourage the Minister to examine what families require to care for the elderly and sick family members in their homes. If the appropriate packages are introduced, families will gladly look after their loved ones in their homes, particularly the elderly who wish to stay at home rather than in a hospital or a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Gormley, Connolly, Finian McGrath, Gregory, Healy and McHugh.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Teachta&iacute; Shinn F&eacute;in. Ar&iacute;s eile t&aacute;im&iacute;d ag pl&eacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im sa ch&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte. Ar&iacute;s eile, n&iacute;l ag an Rialtas mar freagra ach f&eacute;in-mholadh.</P>
      <P>I support the motion and I oppose the Government amendment. I challenge the Government to go to the doorsteps and ask the people to sign up to the hymn of praise of its health record and of the performance of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children that was presented earlier. They will receive a very cold reception in the households of County Monaghan. Once again, a tragedy in my native community is the focus of a motion on health before this House. The death of Pat Joe Walsh outraged people throughout the State. It was needless and avoidable and the system killed him &mdash; a system that dictates that emergency surgery cannot be performed in Monaghan General Hospital. The doors of the operating theatre were literally locked against Pat Joe Walsh. Those with the skill to save his life were prevented from doing so in that hospital.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again that no matter what the inquiry finds out about the availability of beds in other hospitals, this man could and should have been operated on in Monaghan hospital, if only the staff had been allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question on the inquiry into the death of Patrick Walsh in which I sought the terms of reference. The Minister replied earlier that the terms of reference are still being finalised. The report is due for completion within a timeframe of eight weeks. I would like the Minister to outline if that is eight weeks from <Col N="1229"/>the date of the initiation of the inquiry or from the completion of the terms of reference. The terms of reference should include investigation of the policies at HSE and governmental level that contributed directly to the latest tragedy. It should not be confined to the immediate circumstances of the admission of Patrick Walsh to Monaghan and his subsequent death.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in the House last week that no protocols would prevent a medical person doing his or her duty but they do and they have done repeatedly in the case of Monaghan and other hospitals where services have been taken away needlessly. The Taoiseach met the Community Alliance on the day of Patrick Walsh&rsquo;s death. He surely knows the depth of feeling in County Monaghan about the downgrading of our hospital. There is also a determination and I can assure him and this Government that we will not rest until the downgrading of the hospital is halted and services are restored.</P>
      <P>It was revealed last week that a patient with a life threatening vascular swelling had to be taken by his family from Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan to a Dublin hospital because of the unavailability of vascular cover in the north east. The patient was operated on in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and was told later by the surgeon that if he had not been brought to Dublin, he would not have survived. This is another case, which highlights that people in the north east &mdash; Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath &mdash; are being treated like second class citizens where acute hospital services are concerned. News of the plight of this elderly man and of his family came less than a week after the death of Patrick Walsh. It reinforces the demand for a complete revision of acute hospital policy so that life saving services can be accessible to all, regardless of location or ability to pay.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in wants to end the two-tier public private system, the apartheid in the health services. Before the last general election, Fianna F&aacute;il said it wanted &ldquo;the end of the two-tier health system&rdquo;. This year the T&aacute;naiste introduced a scandalous plan to give land on public hospital sites to the developers of private hospitals and, in doing so she denied that we have a two-tier system. How can progress be made when the two parties in Government disagree fundamentally in their diagnosis of what ails the system?</P>
      <P>It is by no means the only inconsistency. If the principle of universal access to the general medical services scheme is accepted for the over 70s, why is it not accepted for those under 18 or for the entire population? According to a reply to another parliamentary question I tabled earlier, the Minister&rsquo;s Department estimates the additional cost of granting medical cards to all those under 18 years would be &euro;223 million. The total cost of the PPARS and FISP fiascos and the useless electronic voting machines is &euro;245 million, <Col N="1230"/>well in excess of what would be needed to extend the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my sympathy to the family of Pat Joe Walsh. Earlier, Deputy Devins stated a number of Members were making political capital out of his case, which is a cynical view. However, the health service is the most important political issue as we approach the next election. The motion recalls that the Minister stated on 25 January 2005 that the accident and emergency service crisis was the litmus test for her and the Government. She also stated that she wanted to deliver a world class health system to which I replied, &ldquo;In your dreams&rdquo;. The T&aacute;naiste took offence at the remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy said the same about the economy. He is defeatist and should be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall what I said. If the T&aacute;naiste believes that by privatising the health service in the American way she will deliver a world class health system, she can continue dreaming. The gap between rich and poor will widen, the two-tier health system will be exacerbated and matters will be made worse. That is not just my opinion; many medical experts say the same. One only has to read the columns of <i>The Irish Times</i> where those concerned have written on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been support for both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been mostly in support on what the Opposition states. As we enter the next general election, we will oppose this point of view. The debate will be between the American model and the Nordic model, which I favour. Why can Sweden, Denmark and other Nordic countries deliver a brilliant health system? We now have 25% fewer beds than we had in the 1980s but 25% more population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have 50% more treatments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s solution is to centralise and have less accountability in the system. She is correct in stating that I opposed plans for the Health Service Executive. When the tragic death of Patrick Joseph Walsh was announced, the person sent out to bat for the T&aacute;naiste was Professor Drumm. The HSE&rsquo;s function is to be the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s mudguard and we have less accountability and less democracy.</P>
      <P>Health boards were criticised in the past but this morning Deputy Sargent recalled a vote by the South Eastern Health Board regarding abuse in the Ferns diocese. A councillor proposing a motion on abuse received the support of only one <Col N="1231"/>of his colleagues. He may have been defeated but we know a vote took place and there was accountability. We can ask people who voted down that proposal why they did so. Now we do not have accountability. The HSE appears before the Joint Committee on Health and Children every so often and certain questions can be posed.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste said she would set up a parliamentary division of the HSE. Questions have been referred but I still await replies. When will this division be set up and when will the staff do their job effectively? When will we have democracy and accountability? During the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s tenure we have had greater centralisation, less democracy, less accountability and a much worse health service. That is the reality and it will be the record of the T&aacute;naiste as we enter the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. We find ourselves speaking about Monaghan in controversial circumstances. I welcome the timely establishment of the eight-week investigation and hope it is completed in that timeframe by an independent individual with no ties to the north eastern health area. I welcome the early admission of the existence of three additional beds, however unpalatable it may be, and that the Walsh family referred to a productive meeting with the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference will concentrate on hands-on staff and direct care givers rather than the root causes of the problems, namely, the policy makers and the configuration of health and hospital services. We referred to health experts but is there any expert group that could ignore a letter signed by all consultant surgeons in Cavan and Monaghan requesting that Monaghan Hospital be allowed cater for acute surgical emergency? Such a letter was sent on 15 September, one month before the death of Patrick Joseph Walsh. The only additional resources these consultants sought was additional on-call theatre staff. Would any expert group not listen to service providers flagging problems? It beggars belief that they did not listen here.</P>
      <P>I have further questions for these worldwide experts. Is it logical to take consultant surgeons from two hospital sites, place them in one hospital site and then request them to drive back daily to perform surgery in the original hospital? This is a waste of time, resources and money. Would any world authority consider it best practice to have six programme managers for acute hospital services in a five-year period, employed in an acting capacity and in charge of a multi-million euro budget? That has happened. In a ten-year period we have had seven Ministers with responsibility for health, from different parties in the House, in charge of a multi-million euro <Col N="1232"/>budget. Does that make sense? The lifetime of a Minister is something like 18 months and I do not know how anyone gets to grips with the brief in that period. There is a lack of consistency and if we saw the same happening with school heads, it would not last. Any private industry attempting the same would go bust immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important motion on the crisis in health services. The T&aacute;naiste and the Government must accept the major problem we have. After eight years in power and considerable resources available, it is not good enough that people are still on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, children and adults with disabilities are on waiting lists, children cannot receive speech therapy or occupational therapy and insufficient community support exists for mental health patients. It is a crime and a scandal and is unacceptable in this day and age. A figure of 300 people on trolleys every day is a disgrace when 500 new beds would resolve this priority issue.</P>
      <P>I propose three sensible ideas to resolve this problem once and for all. An action plan, including the accident and emergency ten-point plan, should be implemented immediately to improve matters in the short term. A hospital development plan should be drafted, with a definite timeframe and funding commitments, for the additional acute and non-acute beds promised in the Government&rsquo;s health strategy. There should be better management of existing resources and the lifting of employment ceilings upon nursing and other frontline staff. All closed beds should be opened with appropriate staffing and admissions and discharge policy should be properly administered.</P>
      <P>Independent Deputies in this House frequently propose practical solutions to the problems in the health services. I urge the T&aacute;naiste to listen to our views and end the nightmare for patients. I have always supported reform in our health services in this House and will continue to do so in the interests of the patient.</P>
      <P>I support this motion as it concerns people, patients, a quality health care service and acceptance of political responsibility for the delivery of health services to the citizens of the State. I urge all Deputies to support this motion as the Government must face up to the urgent and immediate needs of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier this year, when the T&aacute;naiste was 100 days in office as Minister for Health and Children, the Independent Deputies tabled a motion similar to the one before the House tonight. At that time, nothing had changed. In particular, the chaos in accident and emergency departments was worse than it had been previously. After one year of ten-point <Col N="1233"/>plans and a range of promises and commitments, very little has been done.</P>
      <P>The same dreadful scenario continues in the accident and emergency department in the hospital most critical to my constituency, the Mater Hospital. A constant stream of reports of people in their 80s left for days and nights on trolleys is a shame and a scandal for a country heralded as one of the richest in the world. It is only when an elderly family member must seek medical care that the extent of the scandal is brought home to people. There is a shortage of beds and trolleys with elderly patients forced to find a chair on which to spend the night while waiting for a trolley on which they must subsequently wait for a bed. Meanwhile, disruptive and often violent elements are crowded around them. I have had many desperate, anguished calls from relatives who cannot understand why the Government remains inactive and incompetent on this vital issue and seems incapable of decisive action.</P>
      <P>I support my fellow Independent, Deputy Connolly, who has given a strong voice to those campaigning on the Monaghan Hospital crisis.</P>
      <P>I record my disbelief and regret at the manner in which Mr. Pat Joe Walsh was allowed to die in Monaghan General Hospital. Whoever is responsible for Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s untimely death should be held to account for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion. In the brief time available I want to express my sympathy to the Walsh family on the death of Pat Joe Walsh in Monaghan General Hospital. Unfortunately, that death was the result of a pre-Hanly policy, which is now a Hanly policy, and it is a scenario we can foresee happening in many hospitals throughout the country unless the Hanly proposals are set aside. In terms of the policy decisions that were taken, there is no doubt that if the Hanly proposals are implemented, other cases such as that of Pat Joe Walsh will occur throughout the country. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to put on record her position regarding the Hanly proposals. The Taoiseach has already said he will not be proceeding with them. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to tell us whether she agrees with the Taoiseach and to outline her view on the Hanly proposals.</P>
      <P>I support fully the call in the motion to open immediately all outstanding hospital wards and facilities. In 1986 and 1987, 50 beds were closed in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Tipperary town, in my constituency, and the service in that constituency has been in a serious condition since. A total of &euro;30 million has been spent on facilities in Clonmel and &euro;12 million in Cashel but those facilities remain closed. The facility in Clonmel has been closed for over two years and the one in Cashel for over 12 months. I hope those facilities will be opened immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to speak about a deplorable situation that has been allowed to continue in two towns in my constituency. Over a period of time alterations were carried out to &Aacute;ras Mhuire nursing home to provide two palliative care beds. The building works have been completed for a number of months but it has not been possible to open those beds because the staff have not been provided. We now have the farcical situation where approval has been given to employ the number of staff required but they cannot be employed because there is no money to pay them. It is difficult to imagine that there is no money to pay nursing staff to run two palliative care beds in Tuam, County Galway when the Government is continually boasting about the amount of wealth being created in the country. It is unacceptable that there is no money to allow two beds to be operated so that people who are terminally ill can have a little comfort in their last days. It is a disgrace to allow that continue without providing the small sum required. In her contribution the T&aacute;naiste asked for good suggestions. My first suggestion is that she end that disgraceful situation.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Tuam campus project. I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste and the Government to give approval for Tuam community hospital to proceed and also to give approval for an ambulance base to be located in Tuam to serve the north east Galway area, which is an ambulance black-spot. The case for this entire project has been made by me in this Chamber on numerous occasions but time does not allow me go into it tonight. The case was made to the T&aacute;naiste by Tuam town commissioners last January and she promised them on that occasion that she would get back to them within four weeks with a decision. That is 36 weeks ago and the T&aacute;naiste has yet to get back to them. My second suggestion to the T&aacute;naiste, and it is a good one, is to act now on this urgently needed project.</P>
      <P>Last Monday, because of the chaos in the accident and emergency unit in University College Hospital Galway, consideration was being given to closing accident and emergency services completely and declaring a major emergency. That is an indication of the seriousness of the matter. There is little point in the T&aacute;naiste or the Government saying it is an operational matter. It is simple; the buck stops at the door of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I offer my sympathy to the family of Pat Joe Walsh, a man who could and should be alive today. I compliment Patients <Col N="1235"/>Together, Janet Byrne and her mother in particular for the excellent work they have done in highlighting the dire situation in the Mater Hospital over a sustained period.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the first Private Members&rsquo; motion this year, in January 2005, the Minister for Health and Children laid out her stall. She stated: &ldquo;It is a fact that people judge our health services by their experience of accident and emergency units&rdquo;. The Minister&rsquo;s speech is peppered with references to the accident and emergency service and its importance in the health system. The Minister further stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I have stated that long waiting times at accident and emergency departments are not acceptable to me or the Government. . . .that is why we have given top priority at the Cabinet committee on health to improving accident and emergency services. This is why I have brought forward a fully-funded ten-point plan for accident and emergency services for this year.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">We are bringing the greatest focus possible to improving accident and emergency services. Each factor that has caused delays in accident and emergency units is being addressed and each action is being implemented.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That was the tenor of the Minister&rsquo;s speech in January of this year. What has happened in the 12 months since the Minister&rsquo;s appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Has her top priority been addressed by her ten point plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us not even talk about her lesser priorities or those objectives that were not priorities. Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last month I tabled a question asking the Minister to outline the improvement in the accident and emergency waiting lists at the Mater Hospital in the 12 months since she took over stewardship of the Department of Health and Children and promised action on accident and emergency waiting lists as her top priority. She did not answer the question but passed it on to the Health Service Executive from which eventually, after a period of time, I got an answer. The answer did not cover the full period of September to September but September to June and showed not the expected decrease the Minister promised but an alarming increase, from 21 to 36, or a 70% increase, in the daily average number of seriously ill people waiting over six hours on trolleys or chairs. That increase occurred throughout the summer months despite the usual annual reduction of numbers in accident and emergency <Col N="1236"/>units in the summer months. Undoubtedly, as the winter months approach the numbers will further increase.</P>
      <P>I want to give the Minister one example of the current situation in the Mater Hospital. On Sunday, 9 October 2005, a 50 year old man with heart trouble collapsed at 4 a.m. He was rushed to the Mater Hospital by ambulance. He was placed in a chair in a storeroom with three other patients because the accident and emergency department was overcrowded. At 2.30 p.m. he was told he would have to undergo a series of tests but that it would be three to four days before they could be done as he was 35th on the list. He was told he would have to remain on the chair for that period and that if he left he would have to sign himself out to ensure the hospital would not incur any liability. He signed himself out and he and his wife are determined never to set foot in the accident and emergency department again, regardless of what happens. While in the hospital he said there were not enough chairs even in the storeroom and that some people were sitting on the floor eating their lunch before he left the hospital at 2.30 p.m. A man who had been on a chair beside him for three days also signed himself out in that storeroom before he left in utter despair. There was only one ladies and one gents toilet. The two toilets were being used as a bathroom, with people washing in the hand basin and changing their clothes in the bathrooms. Those people had been waiting for days on end.</P>
      <P>The Minister concluded her remarks on 26 January as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">Accident and emergency departments form a litmus test for me, the Government and the people... By focusing our analysis, funding and energy on this area, we will achieve tangible improvements. I look forward to keeping the House and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children well informed of our progress.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister had a different story tonight. She told us a Minister for health cannot be expected to do too much in any one year. She did not show us the results in accident and emergency services in terms of what she promised and the areas on which her ten-point plan had been delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It has improved substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mater Hospital situation has deteriorated rather than improved. We expected some improvement. We did not expect regression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now more than 3,000 days since the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government took office and the health service is worse. It is now more than one year, 391 days since the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Harney, was <Col N="1237"/>given a mandate to reform the Department of Health and Children. Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown is an indictment of the Minister&rsquo;s year of failure and the Government&rsquo;s 3,000 wasted days.</P>
      <?oasys _cl12-?>
      <P>The long promised re-built hospital sanctioned and funded by the rainbow Government and by the sale of hospital lands, finally opened last year. This new building was to be the first phase of an ambitious programme to bring the hospital up to the standards of the other major Dublin hospitals. Phase two was to follow and include upgraded accommodation and acute medical facilities for older people. Phase two was also to include additional specialist services for children and for cancer patients.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the state of unit four, unit five and other units in the hospital, which care for hundreds of elderly people who are looked after by the fabulous staff, particularly in the day hospital? These units date from the 1950s when the hospital began life as a TB sanatorium.</P>
      <P>During her private visits to the hospital to sell tax breaks to consultants and developers, did the T&aacute;naiste take the chance to look at these buildings, which would not be out of place in Romania? Does she know or care that because of her refusal to commit funds to the second phase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In her reply to me last week, she confessed to two meetings at the hospital with consultants and with the developer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Not in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker><Col N="1238"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should get her facts right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am told that it will now be at least another year before these units can be relocated to long-promised accommodation in the old hospital buildings. The apparent abandonment and long-fingering of phase two of the hospital is a disgrace and a betrayal, particularly of older people in the hospital&rsquo;s catchment area.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney&rsquo;s only fresh idea concerning the health services has been to induce the construction industry to get involved in building private hospitals through increasing tax breaks. Labour fought a sustained campaign to get phase one opened and it looks as if we will have to get the banners out again to get phase two.</P>
      <P>In a reply in the House last week, the Minister confessed that she had one meeting with the consultants, her private adviser and an official from the Department of Finance, followed by another meeting with the developer, Mr. Bernard McNamara, to discuss the notion of a private hospital on the public lands of Connolly Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>And the nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Yes, the matron and the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Private hospitals will make a small number of investors very rich. Not only will they get public land at Blanchardstown to build on, but they will also be given guarantees of custom from the national treatment purchase fund and their investments can be used to reduce or eliminate their tax bills. This is a sweetheart deal between the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and Ireland&rsquo;s super rich that puts profit before people. For the public patient it may well mean more delays for treatment. For the health insurance customer it will mean ever-increasing premiums. In case the Minister is unaware, most workers are now forced to buy private health insurance because of the chaos described by my colleague, Deputy Costello.</P>
      <P>These private hospitals are for routine day operations, in addition to knee and hip replacements and grommets for children. They will not have emergency facilities, ICU intensive care or crash teams if somebody becomes ill. The public hospitals will ultimately have to take the responsibility for anyone becoming seriously ill. Many eminent doctors have questioned the wisdom of the headlong rush to tax-sheltered medicine.</P><Col N="1239"/>
      <P>In her address to the House earlier, the Minister said &ldquo;There will be no political directives from me interfering with the management of any hospital or hospitals&rdquo;. Why then did she tell me last week that she sent a policy directive to the HSE to go for private tax-break hospitals? What is the difference between a political directive and a policy directive? The initial letter may be the same in both words but the understanding is very different.</P>
      <P>The Minister holds the responsibility for anyone becoming seriously ill. We want a health service for everyone, not just the wealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning I attended the funeral of a constituent &mdash; a lovely, creative man in his early 60s who died last weekend in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital. On Tuesday evening last week, I received a phone call from this man&rsquo;s wife. She told me that he was a health-insured patient at St. Vincent&rsquo;s and had been undergoing chemotherapy there for some time. On Thursday of the previous week he had been told he needed a blood transfusion and that he would be admitted to the hospital within the next day or two. When that did not happen, the family contacted the hospital and the man was advised by the medical personnel to present himself at the accident and emergency unit. He arrived at accident and emergency at 3 p.m. on Monday but did not get a bed until 6 p.m. on Tuesday, and then only in an annexe rather than in a regular ward.</P>
      <P>I submitted this man&rsquo;s case for discussion on the Adjournment last week but unfortunately it was not reached. His case was not the only one of which I have been made aware in the past week concerning accident and emergency services in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital. I was told about the case of a 76-year-old woman on dialysis who spent from 8 p.m. on Saturday until 5 p.m. on Monday in the accident and emergency department of St. Vincent&rsquo;s waiting for a bed.</P>
      <P>The day before yesterday I received an e-mail from another constituent who wrote:</P>
      <P LI="1">The services for cystic fibrosis, in my opinion, are, to say the least, inconceivably inadequate and that is not doing the bad service the justice it deserves. However, now it seems that for a cystic fibrosis person to get a bed in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital it requires a long waiting period in A&amp;E. My sister, highly prone to infection and very sick, went to A&amp;E on Monday and there she stayed until Thursday, at one stage on a bed in a corridor about four feet wide, with three other patients sitting alongside her and one woman sneezing on her. I heard today that the other cystic fibrosis patients who need to be in hospital will simply <Col N="1240"/>not go in as they are either not up to the wait in A&amp;E or do not want to risk the wait for fear of further deterioration in their health, most likely because of the psychological distress of the ordeal.</P>
      <P FLI="0">None of these cases reflects on the excellent and committed members of staff of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital who do their very best in difficult circumstances. Each of these cases, however, calls into question the adequacy of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital to cater for the needs of the entire population of the east coast from Ballsbridge to Wexford.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report, which is no longer mentioned, but which is still the Government&rsquo;s blueprint on hospital services, examined the hospital needs of the east coast and concluded that the solution was to make St. Vincent&rsquo;s the major hospital serving the area, with all the other hospitals to be defined as local hospitals. St. Vincent&rsquo;s clearly cannot cope with the existing demands on it, much less the demands of the increasing population of the south Dublin suburbs, as well as Wicklow and Wexford. A new hospital is needed at Loughlinstown together with the upgrading of services at St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, to cater for the needs of local people.</P>
      <P>The situation in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital where sick people sometimes wait for days in accident and emergency for the scarce available beds is not acceptable and must be addressed urgently. That is not an adequate hospital service for such a large stretch of the country. The members of staff in St. Vincent&rsquo;s are under enormous pressure in trying to cope with the demands upon them. The three cases I mentioned are just examples of the many cases I have heard about. They involve people who are seriously sick and have to spend long periods in the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department while waiting for a bed.</P>
      <P>The Government constantly tells us that the country is teeming with money and that it has risen further in the OECD league table, but that type of third world hospital service is not acceptable, particularly to those who must endure it. The Government and the Minister are directly responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleagues have given good examples of the crisis that exists in accident and emergency units. It is significant that already we have such serious cases of overcrowding that patients must wait hours in accident and emergency units. I fear what will happen in the next few months because we have not yet reached the peak time for accident and emergency unit activity caused by outbreaks of various illnesses, especially among elderly people, due to poor <Col N="1241"/>weather conditions. The weather has not been too bad up to now.</P>
      <?oasys _cl12-?>
      <P>This issue is urgent but I have not heard anything from the Government side to give the public any reassurance that something is in place to address the problems in accident and emergency units as winter approaches. I hope my prediction will not be fulfilled in the coming months but I very much fear that it will because there is no evidence that anything has changed in the year since the T&aacute;naiste has become Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about this, as is the public. We have heard of appalling incidents such as those described by my colleagues Deputy Costello and Deputy Gilmore. Members of the public have described situations on the radio which nobody should have to put up with, both in terms of the impact on their health and also in terms of their personal dignity. People have a right to privacy and personal dignity from the public health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not getting it, through no fault of the people who work in those services. It is the fault of the entire structure that has not been improved since the T&aacute;naiste became Minister. The necessary sense of urgency is lacking in dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I fear the problem will only get worse in the coming months. I believe the information coming from the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO. These people work in hospitals and I consider the organisation&rsquo;s figures to be perfectly accurate in reflecting what is going on in them.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the confusion that exists regarding the implementation of the Hanly report in terms of relationships between hospitals. We do not know for sure if the Hanly report is being implemented. In my region, both Ennis and Nenagh hospitals are still unsure of the future of their accident and emergency services. In Limerick, which I represent, we are not sure about how the Midwest Regional Hospital will be affected or if it has the capacity to deal with patients who may come in from other parts of the region.</P>
      <P>We are doing nothing to help people to move out of hospital, who are badly described as &ldquo;bed-blockers&rdquo;. This term should not be used to describe people who need long-stay care or support in the community. No co-ordination exists on the matter. I hear regularly about people who could leave hospital if they could get, for example, a disabled person&rsquo;s grant, home help and other supports in the community but it is very difficult to get these co-ordinated quickly enough for a person to move out of an acute hospital bed. <Col N="1242"/>That must be organised on a policy basis. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to ensure there is a nationally co-ordinated policy across Departments to ensure the necessary supports are available in the community. That is not just the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the time remaining I wish to address an issue pertaining to the mid-west of which the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, will be well aware: the provision of radiotherapy services. In the Government amendment there is a reference to the development of a national radiotherapy network to provide essential cancer services for patients in each region. People in the mid-west have raised funds themselves for radiotherapy services. They want to know if the Government will provide money for public patients to be treated on an equal basis in the radiotherapy unit that is about to open in the Midwest Regional Hospital. There is still a lack of clarity on the issue. We want a clear answer from the Minister. The Midwest Hospital trust fund should not be used to pay for provision for public patients in need of radiotherapy services in the region. That is the responsibility of Government.</P>
      <P>There is also confusion as to whether we are still a finite region. We are supposed to be linked to Galway for radiotherapy services and we are linked to Cork for BreastCheck. We are awaiting a number of other specialties. People are not sure if the Midwest Regional Hospital is to be an adjunct of Galway. What is the situation? It is most confusing at present.</P>
      <P>Child psychiatry inpatient beds have not been provided in the mid-west. There has also been a lack of provision in the areas of neurology and mental health care in accident and emergency units, which my colleague, Deputy Neville, has raised many times and of which the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is well aware. There is a litany of issues that are of concern to the public and to us as public representatives but there is no evidence that the political will exists to address these issues in a positive way.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a relative of somebody who took ill suddenly while on holidays in another EU country. The instant care available and teams that could speak to the family and provide a full service were such a contrast to what we have here. The public had confidence that the T&aacute;naiste would deliver. She has now had stewardship of the health system for a year and the public has been hugely disappointed. I hope that things will not get worse but I very much fear they will in the next few months.</P>

Let us not mix up ideology with what is best for the patient. The proposal has been made by the hospital community and it is very worthy of examination.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a solid proposal to increase bed capacity in the hospital and it seeks to ensure that public patients have access to the public beds in the hospital. It will also ensure that the private beds will also be available for public patients. It is worthy of examination. I am very concerned that the principal finance spokesperson, whom I had hoped would be eligible to be Minister of Finance in a future rainbow Government, is so dismissive of our proposal, which represents value for money to the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy McManus, whom I thank for introducing this motion to enable the House to debate the dire state of the health service in this very wealthy country. I want to address the Labour Party proposal to put in place supports at community level so that patients, particularly elderly patients, can be cared for in their own homes and communities. I want to debunk the humbug and hypocrisy of that part of the Government amendment which commends the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on having a specific focus on the needs of older people. I will demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
      <P>Home helps are neighbours or friends who provide essential care to the elderly at home and enable older citizens to live in dignity and some degree of comfort in their own homes. They do housework, cooking and shopping. Until recently, some home helps were paid at a rate that would be expected by a Filipino hairdresser on Irish Ferries. Their trade union, however, was successful in a claim for a decent wage for them. How did Harney and this wasters&rsquo; Government react? They cut the number of home help hours that <Col N="1252"/>could have been provided. They did this without regard to the suffering of the senior citizens involved, the knock-on effect on acute bed occupancy and the take-up of the long-stay accommodation. That is some special focus.</P>
      <P>In reply to my parliamentary question on 28 September 2005, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, stated the hours of home help provided in County Kildare between 2003 and 2005 had been cut by a massive 40%. A mere two weeks later, on 13 October, the T&aacute;naiste blankly denied that there were any cuts in the home help service. In doing so, I believe she deliberately misled this House. Her cold-hearted and cruel actions have led to real suffering and stress on the part of every old person in Kildare who previously availed of the service. All have reduced hours and many have had the service withdrawn completely.</P>
      <P>One couple in their early 80s, both with heart conditions and other old age related ailments, were managing fine with a home help service of one hour per day and were happy and content in their home and community, but heartless Mary and this wasters&rsquo; Government targeted them and other similar people for savings. The service of the couple was terminated and consequently one is now in long-stay care and the other is in an acute hospital bed. They will have to sell their home to pay Mary Harney&rsquo;s friends in the private nursing home sector. Shame on her. I could give her a list of similar cases as long as my arm. Harney persists with the myth that there were no cuts in Kildare, yet home help hours were cut by 40% on her watch.</P>
      <P>The other service which was available and which worked involved the disabled person&rsquo;s grant. This grant assisted old and disabled people with the provision of downstairs toilets, showers and, perhaps, bedrooms. This allowed people to remain in their homes and communities. It is now virtually impossible to obtain these grants in County Kildare as the money has not been provided. Let that sink in. The Government did not provide the authorities with the money to pay the grants or build the downstairs toilets or showers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I listened intently to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply to the points made by my colleagues last night and I was flabbergasted. When I was growing up in the 1960s my family had an old record player the needle of which often stuck <Col N="1254"/>on one spot so we heard the same old lines coming out. Eventually we had to lift the needle to get it over the rim. The Minister for Health and Children repeated the claptrap I have heard from this Government for the past eight years.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why the people of Longford and Westmeath have waited eight years for a decent hospital, as promised in 1997? During that time the Minister allowed at least &euro;150 million be frittered away while the taxpayers of Longford and Westmeath paid their money and she did nothing about the hospital. The Minister is in no position to tell anybody here about hypocrisy. She turned up last April for a photo opportunity with her colleagues when the doors of the 12 bed paediatric unit were opened. As soon as she left the doors closed behind her and the staff are waiting to be appointed. Is that the way to run a health service?</P>
      <P>This Government fails to give the people what they deserve, but the people are waiting in the long grass. We will not forget. I was in Longford and Westmeath recently where I met a nurse who asked me when the 12 bed unit would open. I said it should have opened by now. She hoped it would open in November or December because she works in the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital but would like to work 20 miles from her home, in Mullingar where she is badly needed.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think the electorate I represent are fools? Is it not a sad day when a hospital such as Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin, where a close relative of mine is a patient, needs additional funding? The Minister should not say the hospital does not need funding. Why are Niall Quinn and popular musicians donating money to it?</P>
      <P>It would shame anybody but most of all it is to the Minister&rsquo;s shame that her ideology is to privatise the health service. She wants to look after the interests of the property developer instead of the public provision of hospital services. This is an ideological argument in which the Minister is very much to the right.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal. The Minister should first give &euro;100 million to Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin, an excellent facility with excellent nurses. I know the unbelievable work they did to save a young relative of mine. I know too, as a barrister, as should the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that people who are handicapped as a result of accidents may have to wait to be admitted to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. That is not good enough. It too deserves &euro;100 million.</P>
      <P>That is how I would have spent the &euro;200 million the Minister will waste on PPARS. Surely people can write with biros or whatever to ensure staff receive their wages? None of them will <Col N="1255"/>receive &euro;100,000 or &euro;1 million more than they should. The manual system always got the payroll right. The Minister should put that money into services that are needed for children and for those who are severely disabled or handicapped as a result of car or other accidents.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P>I would be willing to pay another cent or two in tax, a suggestion the Minister does not like to hear, to ensure the services are provided for everyone belonging to me and the people of this country, young and old. Why should nurses working in Mullingar have to deal with 135% and 140% over capacity of patients at Christmas? The Minister told Deputy Paul McGrath that the hospital is going to tender in March 2006. It will have taken 11 years by the time it is open. One third of the hospital was provided in 1997 &mdash; a lovely building destroyed now by bird droppings.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister know what the concept of value for money means? It is value for money if it is for the private investor. There is no reference to value for money when the service is for ordinary people who pay their taxes and do not leave the country to dodge them. They are the people who count. The next election will focus on ideology and putting people&rsquo;s well-being before the profits and economics of the right wing classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everybody on this side of the House who contributed to the debate, particularly my colleagues in the Labour Party. It was significant that people concentrated on articulating the views and experiences of ordinary people in their constituencies who sometimes encounter horrific problems in accessing health care. Many speakers could have scored political points by talking about squandering resources and the wasteful habits of this Government but instead they chose to use the time effectively to bring forward the concerns of people who have no other way of being heard.</P>
      <P>It was interesting that the Fianna F&aacute;il contributions were about problems, such as the need for more radiotherapy services, or to deal with MRSA, or the elderly. The speakers might as well have been on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>With some regret I say the Minister made a most unworthy speech, the worst I have ever heard Deputy Harney or anybody in this House make. It was silly and self-serving, and trivialised serious matters in the health service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It was self-serving and dishonest. It seems to us that the Minister suffers from overweening ambition. She thought she could float into the Department of Health and Children and get everybody working in new ways that would sort out the problems. She has proved only that she can make as many hollow promises as her predecessor, Deputy Martin. She promised to deliver real and measurable improvements in accident and emergency services within months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaeSextonPD"><NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s medical contacts are making sure that does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That was her promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaeSextonPD"><NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s vested interests will make sure it does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the promise she made and no amount of interruption will change the plain truth that we all know because we can daily see that accident and emergency services have deteriorated. People are waiting longer during this Minister&rsquo;s period of office. The number of people waiting in accident and emergency departments has grown. I was astonished to hear from Deputy Howlin that one night a couple of weeks ago 41 people were on trolleys and chairs in Wexford Hospital, a small hospital. We have grown used to the fact that in Tallaght Hospital there will be 40 people on trolleys and chairs and in the Mater Hospital patients are suffering horrific conditions but the problem is getting measurably worse.</P>
      <P>We were told this new broom of a Minister would clean up the hospitals but the incidence of MRSA has grown significantly worse &mdash; five babies in the National Maternity Hospital have been affected by it. We depend most on health services at the beginning and the end of life. What legacy will this Minister leave after her next 18 months in the health services? Will more vulnerable elderly people and neonates be at risk?</P>
      <P>That is the pattern and until we have a Government that faces up to the hard facts there will be further deterioration. That, not the individual stories, is what most concerns me. There is a blanket refusal and denial of the facts. When I heard the Taoiseach recently talking gobbledygook about the health service to the people I was chilled because I realised we will get nothing from this Government. We will get no change for the better. The Minister falls back on the Health Service Executive at every turn but it is a bureaucratic nightmare that does not work. It is a very expensive experiment with which not even Niamh Brennan agreed. Let us get real. There is no longer any accountability in the system. The people who have now been in charge for eight <Col N="1257"/>years are becoming less accountable, and that goes right through the health service. Ordinary patients do not have access to influence and power, and God knows there was limited access in the time of the health boards. Now there is none.</P>
      <P>For the Minister to say that the national treatment purchase fund did not deny access to private hospitals for care is simply not true. Let her say that to my 70-year-old constituent who was told by her specialist at the Blackrock Clinic that the NTPS was not providing the money, so that the operation could not take place. That also happened in the case of an elderly woman from Dunboyne trying to get a heart operation in the Mater Hospital. She was told the same thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one thing the Minister cannot take from me. When I raise issues such as <Col N="1258"/>these, it is because people have asked me to do so and because I have the evidence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for taking this matter on behalf of his senior Minister. What is it about the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that trouble seems to follow the poor man around? Whatever Ministry he has been in, controversy, whether due to his own actions or otherwise, has never been far away.</P>
        <P>This issue is of critical importance for the 10,000 plus workers in the company and for the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on the services of An Post. From observing this situation evolve over the past three years, no progress has been made in that time. The Government and the institutions of the State have been unable to resolve the key difficulty between management and unions regarding work practices. Can the Minister of State answer on behalf of the Minister as to what exactly the Minister now intends doing?</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was interesting yesterday to hear the Taoiseach speak at length in the D&aacute;il on the issue and the lengths to which he said the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has gone in negotiations with the unions to try to broker some type of agreement. Meanwhile the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, last weekend made some remarkable <Col N="1262"/>comments about the possible future development of the company. In his closing remarks on that occasion, he said he would not get involved because otherwise there would be a huge amount of trouble in regard to social partnership if he started to circumvent or change Labour Court decisions. It seems the Government is having it both ways. The only matter about which there is a degree of certainty was his further comments whereby it seems the action he intends to take, if a strike proceeds as threatened by the CWU, would result in, as the Minister puts it, a demand from the public because of the lack of a service for a speeding up of the liberalisation of the postal service and that would mark the demise of An Post as we know it. I am sure that threat, if made, was not lightly made. The Minister must have given serious consideration to such a remarkable statement about an important social and economic service provided by the State. Despite liberalisation under EU directives, An Post still has a universal service obligation as our main provider, which will continue after 2009 and which is best provided by a State company managed in a proper fashion. It is clear that is not what we have had in recent years.</P>
        <P>We have had a problem at boardroom level in that the board, appointed by the Government, has had no involvement in the strategic development of the company. The management has taken a company that was cash rich and was investing significantly in capital into one that is in utter financial crisis and such capital investment seems to have been wasted. There seems to be an inability between the management and the unions, despite <Col N="1263"/>lengthy negotiations at the Labour Court, to agree on work practices that need to be changed. The Government seems to be indicating that the only possible outcome from this stalemate is the demise or early break-up of the company, prior to further liberalisation.</P>
        <P>Given such incredible, remarkable, strong and forthright comments from the Minister, we need some clarity on those positions as to what exactly he intends doing. If a strike occurs, is it his intention to effectively liberalise the market far more rapidly and bring in new operators? Has the long negotiation process around work practices come to an end? Has the process involving the Labour Court and the other institutions of bargaining and negotiation come to an end or, if not, what is the alternative way forward?</P>
        <P>Currently only 78% of letters are delivered the next day as against the 94% target. The Minister outlined that the company finds itself constrained in terms of paying overtime in some instances where overtime is not worked. There are instances where pensioners and other workers in this company have not been paid &mdash; unlike almost every other worker in the State -the proper pay under Sustaining Progress. Such a situation is a sign of a dysfunctional company operated by a dysfunctional Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Members present on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is unable to be here. I will respond on his behalf to this matter and I thank the Deputy for raising it.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government are fully committed to An Post remaining a strong player in the Irish postal market and recognise the invaluable contribution made by An Post and its staff down through the years, both in terms of their input to the overall business environment and the role played by both rural post offices and postmen and postwomen in maintaining the social fabric of rural society.</P>
        <P>However, in order to be strong, the company must be financially viable. As the Minister stated previously in the House, the reality is that the company has suffered significant losses in recent years starting with &euro;6.7 million in 2001, rising to &euro;17.4 million in 2002 and then reaching an unsustainable level of &euro;42.9 million in 2003. This sort of financial performance, if allowed to continue unchecked, would have bankrupted the company. The reality is that the company needs to introduce modern work practices if it is to thrive in a competitive environment. An Post will face more rather than less competition in coming years and it needs to be geared to address this challenge.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to set out the lengthy background to the current industrial relations <Col N="1264"/>situation at An Post and to impress upon Deputies that this situation has not arisen over night. An Post has been through one of the most intensive industrial relations processes imaginable. This process started when, following the disclosure of serious losses for 2003, the Government asked the board and management of An Post to prepare a recovery strategy in order to return to financial solvency. The plan involved changes in work practices and voluntary job losses and was presented to the An Post unions in late 2003.</P>
        <P>Around the same time, in recognition of the dire financial situation facing the company, An Post invoked the inability to pay clause under Sustaining Progress. This was followed by industrial action in the Dublin mail centre in March 2004. The Labour Relations Commission brokered settlement proposals, which involved negotiations on collection and delivery and in the event of non-agreement in the LRC, referral to the Labour Court.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Both parties spent from April to November 2004 in the LRC. The proposals arising out of the LRC were put to members of the CWU and turned down. The outstanding issues were then referred to the Labour Court for resolution. On foot of union concerns that An Post management had no real experience of the postal sector, the Labour Court appointed a three-person expert group to come up with a workable proposal on collection and delivery that would be acceptable to members of the CWU. This group spent six months working on a comprehensive proposal on this area which was published in July 2005. In early 2005, the An Post group of unions referred the non-payment of Sustaining Progress to the Labour Relations Commission as provided for under the Sustaining Progress agreement. The LRC appointed assessors to examine the claim. The assessor&rsquo;s report recommended that, having regard to An Post financials, 5% should be paid to employees backdated to 1 January this year. This recommendation was accepted by An Post management and rejected by CWU. Having received the report of the three-person expert group, the Labour Court issued a comprehensive recommendation which outlined that the acceptance of the deal on collection and delivery would trigger payment of the bulk of Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <?oasys _cl12-?>
        <P>The Labour Court recommendation was considered by the executive of the CWU but was not put to a ballot of members. Instead the union decided to ballot for strike action on the non-payment of Sustaining Progress. The membership has voted for strike action and the union has given two weeks&rsquo; strike notice. It is not clear at this stage what type of action this will be. As the Taoiseach and Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, have both outlined, the way to resolve the indus<Col N="1265"/>trial relations issues in An Post is to engage on the basis of the Labour Court recommendation. This is necessary to bring about the essential modernisation of the company which is the best way of securing long term sustainable jobs for An Post workers and ensuring the continuation of a high quality nationwide postal delivery and post office service.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the decision by the CWU to take industrial action will impact on both personal and business customers. An Post is preparing contingency and communications plans to deal with the forthcoming industrial action which will address, in particular, the needs of social welfare recipients and provide information to customers regarding postal services.</P>
        <P>On the liberalisation question, the competitive pressure on An Post is not in the future but in the here and now. Large international companies such as Royal Mail and the German post office already operate in the Irish market. If An Post cannot meet consumer needs and deliver a high quality of service, these companies will be more than happy to ramp up their operations here to fill the gap.</P>
        <P>Time is not on the side of An Post and its workers. Some member states such as Finland and Sweden have already fully liberalised their postal markets and others are in the process of doing so. The momentum for liberalisation already exists. If An Post does not start to restructure, it will not be in a position to meet the competitive challenges of a fully liberalised postal market, and that is why the company&rsquo;s modernisation must start now.</P>

      <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I speak on behalf of the town of Youghal which in recent years has experienced substantial job losses: 230 jobs in Artisan Technology, 130 jobs in Eastman Kodak and 40 jobs this week in Seafield Technical Textiles Limited which has decided to close.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that there does not appear to be any urgency on the part of the State agencies or the Government to attract additional industry to Youghal. The town is an attractive coastal one in east Cork with much in its favour. Recently we have all lobbied for a new swimming pool and community school, both of which will proceed and be beneficial. However, people in Youghal must leave the town every morning and drive to Carrigtwohill, Cork city, Fermoy and Dungarvan for employment purposes. This has a knock-on effect on businesses in Youghal. I ask the Minister to use his good offices and those of the Government, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to encourage and attract industry to <Col N="1266"/>Youghal. A number of small industries in the town would work wonders.</P>
        <P>That Bord G&aacute;is is not in the town acts as a disincentive to industry. There is a chicken and egg scenario in this because Bord G&aacute;is will not supply the town unless there is industry and industry will not locate until there is a gas supply. Perhaps the Minister can shed some light on that conundrum and help us resolve it. I am informed that broadband will arrive in the town shortly.</P>
        <P>It would also help if the National Roads Authority would look at Castlemartyr because that village between Youghal and Cork city badly needs to be bypassed. I have written to the NRA on many occasions about it. There are tailbacks more than a mile long every evening and it is worse on summer Sundays. That acts as a disincentive for industry to locate to Youghal. I ask the Minister to dust down that file and have a chat with the NRA. Perhaps he would come back to me on the timescale and procedure for bypassing Castlemartyr and, thus, bring Youghal closer to Cork city and make it more attractive.</P>
        <P>If decentralisation were to come to the town, it would help as it would bring more people. I would hope they would live and work there. Property prices in the town are still manageable. As part of the overall package, perhaps the Minister would let the House know what is happening in that regard and the timescale.</P>
        <P>At one stage Youghal had full employment and was a thriving manufacturing base. Unfortunately the type of industry there and in many other centres is leaving owing to international competition. Seafield Technical Textiles Limited produced Gore-Tex type fabric used for military uniforms, postbags and so on. It has come under pressure from eastern European imports. When the Irish Army produced a new uniform some years ago, it was regrettable it did not use the top class Gore-Tex type cloth produced in Youghal for the uniform. Instead the cloth was imported from China and tailored in eastern Europe.</P>
        <P>Altana Pharma, a company that located in Carrigtwohill, was not encouraged by IDA Ireland to locate in Youghal. Having looked at the town, it was a disappointment the company did not locate there. I am concerned about the policy of IDA Ireland to promote small provincial towns such as Youghal. Is it Government policy that people would live and work in their own area and cut down on traffic and congestion on the roads, something the Minister would like to see happening? I await his response with hope. We are all working together to try to benefit our areas. At this time of year when the tourists have left, Youghal goes into the doldrums, a matter I would like to see reversed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1267"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who unfortunately cannot be present. The Minister has asked me to say how concerned he is that Seafield Technical Textiles Limited has announced that owing to adverse trading conditions, it has become necessary to cease trading with the loss of 38 jobs. He is conscious of the adverse effects on workers in Youghal of these job losses and other job losses in recent years.</P>
        <P>Seafield Technical Textiles Limited manufactures technical fabrics for industrial and specialised apparel. Most of the production is exported. The company has experienced difficult trading conditions over recent years, but these have become even more acute during 2005. In common with other companies in the sector, customers have switched sourcing their supply of goods to lower cost economies.</P>
        <P>Management at the company had tried to diversify into new markets and new product areas. The company has also tried to cut costs, including putting staff on three-day week schedules. However, the rate of decline of its present customer base during 2005 means that the drain on cash is too severe to give the company time to recover through diversification. The last quarter of the company&rsquo;s financial year is usually the busiest period and management delayed the decision to close to see if a seasonal increase in orders from September would arise. However, this did not occur and I understand the company was left with little option but to close. F&Aacute;S has contacted the company and the full range of F&Aacute;S services are being offered to the staff.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the investment decisions of some companies are influenced by the competitive attractions of alternative geographic locations. As with most other European countries, there are areas of activity in which Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is seriously challenged. In the main these are areas where availability of capable lower cost locations makes costs the primary driver behind business decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The industrial development agencies will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area and I will convey the specific comments made by Deputy Stanton re gas and so on. IDA Ireland promotes east Cork to potential investors on an ongoing basis and every effort is being made to secure further advanced knowledge-based industry for the east Cork area, including Youghal. IDA Ireland will continue to promote east Cork actively to potential investors from across the full range of IDA Ireland targeted sectors such as pharmaceuticals, medical <Col N="1268"/>technologies, information and communications technologies and internationally traded services.</P>
        <P>In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with its existing clients in Youghal and east Cork to encourage them to expand their operations in the area. There are currently 137 IDA-assisted companies in County Cork employing in excess of 18,500 people. Over recent years, in terms of new foreign investment in east Cork, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and internationally traded services are among the area&rsquo;s strongest performers. I have seen for myself that the economy of the general area is strong. Such investments are attracted to east Cork due to the availability of a high quality workforce, a well-developed infrastructure and very positive business environment. In the period from 2002 to 2004, more than 50% of all jobs announced in Cork came from companies locating in the broader east Cork area. Due to its proximity to the greater Cork area, Youghal has also benefited from this development. As Deputy Stanton has said it is an extraordinarily attractive place to live and rear a family.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland works with just under 750 client companies in County Cork, which according to the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey 2004, employ a total of 19,617 people. Approximately 140 of these companies are in the east Cork area, including Youghal, with a total employment of approximately 3,700. Enterprise Ireland has worked closely with community groups in the towns of east Cork including Youghal, to foster further embryonic enterprise and to encourage young graduates to set up businesses in their own localities. Enterprise Ireland has approved feasibility study funding to explore the possibility of a community enterprise centre in Youghal. I am sure if that comes about it would be a very positive development.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this issue today. A number of elderly people in particular have contacted me about letters they have received from the Department of Social and Family Affairs stating that their entitlement to the annual winter fuel allowance of &euro;12.90 per week, as it is in Dublin, is now terminated. These people are tenants of Dublin City Council living in centrally controlled and centrally heated communal complexes. On average they pay &euro;6 or &euro;7 per week for 52 weeks or a minimum of &euro;300 to the local authority. At the same time the fuel allowance operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs lasts for 29 weeks from September to mid April. They were receiving this allowance which was worth approximately &euro;375 per person per year.</P>
        <P>I understand approximately 237 people have been identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs as being in receipt of both benefits. This was determined in a trawl by the Department. I do not know how the trawl was initiated and how it was suddenly discovered after so many years &mdash; I would like to know for how many years this operated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In total the &euro;12.90 per week for 29 weeks of the year amounts to approximately &euro;90,000 per annum. We are not talking about large sums of money and there is no question of fraud. This matter was raised by Deputies Upton and Quinn on 5 October. Last week I was sitting in the Chair when the Minister for Social and Family Affairs addressed the matter. He explained the Department&rsquo;s thinking on the matter. He did not give any indication of how the trawl came about. He expressed some sympathy for the people and said he would review the situation, as was his response to Deputies Upton and Quinn. Some 274,000 households are in receipt of the fuel allowance. The 237 people involved represent less than 0.1%. We are talking about very small numbers. These are virtually all elderly or disabled as otherwise they would not receive the fuel allowance.</P>
        <P>Why should we not give them a Christmas box? Nobody was aware of the anomaly up to now. Nobody is complaining about it or suggesting they are being discriminated against. However, the old and disabled people in receipt of the allowance are sorely missing it since it has been withdrawn. They are missing the extra heat. Elderly and disabled people need such extra heat to which they had become accustomed. They are not to blame for what was an anomaly or an error in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to do the generous and honourable thing and allow those 237 people who are in need of as much heat as they can get for the 29 months during which the fuel allowance is <Col N="1270"/>payable to retain it so that they can put on a fire occasionally and have the extra bit of heat that makes life tolerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. It is an interesting case and as he stated no fraud was intended on the part of the 237 households. However, because of a glitch they were effectively receiving a double allowance for the same purpose. The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments towards meeting their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from the end of September to mid-April. Some 274,000 customers, 151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement, benefit under the scheme at a cost of &euro;85.4 million in 2005. In that context &euro;700,000 is a small amount.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the scheme a fuel allowance of &euro;9.00 per week is paid to eligible households during this 29-week winter heating period, with an additional &euro;3.90 per week being paid in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. In addition to fuel allowance, more than 300,000 pensioners and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of &euro;108.8 million in 2005. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. To qualify for an allowance under the national fuel scheme an applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, live alone or only with a dependent spouse, partner, child or children, or with other eligible recipients.</P>
        <P>In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, the Department recently ceased allowance entitlement which had been paid in error to certain recipients who were in, or had moved to local authority accommodation with subsidised or low-cost heating. The main purpose of the review was to ensure that the allowance eligibility rules were being applied correctly and consistently. The allowances in question, which should not have been put in payment in the first place, were withdrawn in these cases with effect from the start of this winter heating season. The allowance was not included in their new pension books or in EFT payments. The Department is not seeking repayment of the overpayment of the allowance which arose in these cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very generous of it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1271"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In other cases it has happened and from the taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view the Deputy understands why that is. There was no fraud by any of these people. As a long-standing policy within the scheme, fuel allowance is not payable to those who are able to provide for their heating needs from their own resources, for example, if they have access to their own fuel supply or benefit from a subsidised heating service such as those provided by Dublin City Council at a number of its housing complexes. The basis for this condition of the scheme is that the contribution that local authority tenants in communal heating situations make towards their heating costs is limited to a fixed and relatively small amount, typically approximately &euro;6 per week, included as part of their overall rent charge. Unlike other tenants and social welfare clients generally, who must buy their own fuel at prevailing retail cost, these tenants are protected from increases in heating costs, the true cost of which are subsidised significantly by Dublin City Council and the other local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>In local authority communally heated dwellings, the subsidised heating is provided from September to May inclusive, which is approximately ten weeks longer than the duration of the national fuel scheme, which runs for 29 weeks from September to mid-April. To ease the burden on the tenant, payments to the local authority are spread over 52 weeks. In addition to heating each room in the flats, the local authority also provides hot water 24 hours a day, each day of the year, the charge for which is also included in the above costs. The central heating provided is not optional. Subsidised heating tends to be available mainly in the older flat-type complexes operated by the local authorities rather than the new individual units being constructed. These latter units typically have their own individual heating systems.</P>
        <P>To retain the allowance in the case of the people concerned in this particular review, when neighbouring tenants in very similar circumstances are not eligible and are managing their budgets accordingly, would be difficult to support. The fact is that these people either were awarded an allowance in error initially or retained a previous legitimate allowance entitlement inadvertently when they moved to accommodation subsequently with subsidised heating.</P>
        <P>Pensioners and other social welfare groups have received significant increases in their welfare payment rates this year and in recent years under this Government. This has improved their income situation considerably in real terms relative to solid fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. The higher rates of primary payments are payable for a full 52 weeks of the <Col N="1272"/>year, a major change from what was the case previously. In view of the particular circumstances to which the Deputy and others have referred, the Minister has asked his Department to review the cases as a matter of urgency. However, any change to the scheme would have very significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of the resources available to the Minister for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <sTitle>Electoral System.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this topic for the Adjournment debate. The report of the Democracy Commission, published today and entitled Engaging Citizens, describes itself as a &ldquo;timely audit of the state of democracy in Ireland&rdquo;. Indeed, it is timely, given that it is 18 months until the next general election and this report asks us, as the people who will run that election, what we can do to engage citizens and make democracy more relevant to them.</P>
        <P>The commission&rsquo;s research shows that while people are somewhat disillusioned and disenchanted, they are not disengaged. That is something we must be pleased about. The report also refers to the fact that many politicians share that disillusionment and, as a Government backbencher, one often feels disenfranchised in many ways. One can become frustrated by the political process when one sees people who can make decisions not making them as quickly as one might like.</P>
        <P>Several recommendations in the report are worth further discussion, in particular the question of citizenship and what it means. The commission believes that &ldquo;citizenship of the future is likely to rely more on loyalty to democratic institutions and the rule of law than on an identity based on birth, language and religion&rdquo;. It is time that we all recognised that fact. However, in recognising it, we need to make sure that those democratic institutions have absolute integrity.</P>
        <P>That brings me to the recommendations of the commission on the running of elections. It recommends the establishment of an independent electoral commission, something we should examine because we need to have an election process that is separate from the political process.</P>
        <P>Another recommendation relates to the electoral register, which we all recognise as being the most fundamental element of our system of democracy. It states who is eligible to vote but, as the Minister stated in response to a question some time ago, the level of inaccuracy therein is <Col N="1273"/>significant. In the Minister&rsquo;s response he indicated that there were 3.002 million people eligible to vote but the census data for the same period indicated that there should have been only 2.71 million voters. This represents an enormous difference of approximately 300,000 and in an electoral contest, that figure is considerable.</P>
        <P>The commission recommends the introduction of a system of automatic registration based on PPS numbers. The PPS number is an individual, unique identity which every citizen receives. This would ensure 100% accuracy. Only people with PPS numbers should be represented on the electoral register. I have heard the Minister indicate that there are obstacles to such a system, including data protection issues, but such obstacles can be surmounted. Data protection should not stand in the way of an individual&rsquo;s fundamental right to vote. We must recognise which right should take precedence. I urge the Minister to consider introducing such a system because accuracy is what elections are all about and is vitally important.</P>
        <P>The report also deals with the question of engaging people in citizenship. The commission indicates that we are alone among people in Europe in not having a political education system from primary level through to second level. I wonder how relevant and central politics is to people. We need to focus not just on schools but also on adult education. We have a very unique and sophisticated voting system. When I was canvassing during the 2002 general election I met 18 year olds who had no idea how to vote. As we know, as professionals, it is a very sophisticated system and keeping somebody out of office is as important as electing a candidate. The voting system can be used in that manner and we need to engage people.</P>
        <P>One flaw in the report is its advocacy of gender quotas. I not believe in such quotas and do not think they are the way to go. However I recommend the report and hope we will have further opportunities to discuss its contents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Malley for raising the issue and I assure her that being an ex-Government backbencher is even more frustrating than being a backbencher. I say that as one who has suffered that ignominious situation, when the people of Wicklow turned the other way once.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report of the Democracy Commission. The report, entitled Engaging Citizens, is the culmination of over two years of research and consultation throughout the island of Ireland and contains many worthwhile recommendations on how to mobilise voters, particularly those who feel disenfranchised or who do not participate in the democratic process, and how to ensure equal <Col N="1274"/>opportunities for voters and candidates alike to fulfil their democratic duties.</P>
        <P>I believe that the cynicism that is heaped upon political life in this country must have something to do with disenchantment. It would be a welcome development if the cynics would occasionally enter their names on the election lists. Perhaps there would be much better people in this House if they had that courage. However, frequently, if not invariably, they do not.</P>
        <P>The report merits careful consideration and I will reflect on the views, findings and recommendations contained in it. I am pleased to note that some of the measures in the report are currently under consideration in my Department, which is interesting in itself.</P>
        <P>We must secure greater participation by the people in the democratic process and the Department and I have been working steadfastly towards that goal. Coincidentally, the publication of this report takes place a few days before the launch of the Department&rsquo;s annual nationwide public information campaign to promote awareness of the draft register of electors. The objective of this campaign is to encourage voters to check the draft register to ensure that they are registered correctly and also to remind them that they cannot exercise their right to vote unless they are registered. For many years political parties did this work by going door to door. I remember the Labour Party coming to my door shortly after I first moved into Greystones to remind me to put my name on the voting register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should have told them where to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed, shame on them. The reality is that it was an exercise in real politics and the cynics who often criticise politicians castigated that practice but the situation has worsened since it ended.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a collective responsibility on us all as individual citizens to check the register and make sure our details are correct. There is also a clear role for public representatives to promote awareness of the register and the need for individual action. A high quality register of electors is essential for the successful operation of the electoral system and the democratic process. This campaign is an important opportunity for us all to work towards that objective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also considering further measures, including updated guidance in the short-term, to assist and support registration authorities in fulfilling their role in the registration process. This is &ldquo;genteel-speak&rdquo; for saying I will encourage them to do their job better than they have been doing. However, we should not lose sight of the positive achievements made. For example, following years <Col N="1275"/>of steady decline, the percentage of the electorate who turned out at the latest polls held in June last year for the European and local elections and for the referendum on citizenship, reversed the downward trend. On average, the national turn-out rose from 51% to 59%, which is a good trend.</P>
        <P>I noted considerable interest in the recommendation by the commission for the introduction of electronic voting for all elections here. I welcome its view that such a system is well worth introducing for the benefits it will bring. Sadly, there was not a debate on the benefits and whether electronic voting was a better system than the system we had. My Department is undertaking a programme of further assessment and testing of the electronic voting and counting system to address the issues raised by the Commission on Electronic Voting and to demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately. I would be deluding myself if I suggested that this will be an easy job because we must rebuild confidence in the system. I doubt if we will use it before the 2007 election.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I welcome the call for greater emphasis on democracy and citizenship in edu<Col N="1276"/>cation. My Department has been involved in a number of educational initiatives on this issue and contributed to the development of a transition year course on democracy which was piloted last year. With more courses like this available both at primary, and particularly at secondary level, I foresee a substantial improvement in participation. I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Malley that this is something we should take far more seriously.</P>
        <P>I thank the members of the Democracy Commission for their tireless dedication to their task. As well as the many other pressures on their time and energy, this is a very worthwhile exercise. I am confident their work will provide a sound basis for further research and concrete actions to improve the democratic process. Above all, I hope it will contribute to a more mature and considered debate on issues and on the institutions and processes of democracy than has been the case in recent times.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 116 together.</P>
        <P>Throughout the EU, it has been recognised for some time that agriculture alone cannot provide a sufficient income to support the majority of farm families, or indeed, provide the impetus to sustain the economic and social fabric of rural communities. The successful conclusion of the recent European negotiations on a new rural development regulation represented a clear political response to this reality. European rural policy now embodies a renewed focus on an integrated rural development approach with special emphasis on the rural environment and rural economic development outside the farm gate.</P>
        <P>Farming will continue to play an important role in the rural economy, particularly as an integral part of a multi-functional agriculture providing not just food security but also as a key provider of public good. However, in the words of the Agri-Vision report &ldquo;agriculture will no longer be the primary driver of rural development in Ireland.&rdquo; Clearly, there is a need to provide suitable local employment opportunities capable of sustaining a viable rural population. A dynamic rural Ireland <Col N="1278"/>needs to be created in the context of our overall strategy for economic and spatial development and not just within the confines of agricultural policy.</P>
        <P>The EU Community strategic guidelines for rural development 2007-2013 set out priority areas for action under the Council regulation on support for rural development by the European agricultural fund for rural development, EAFRD. These guidelines clearly call for priority to be given to the development of the economic potential of rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recently adopted EU Council regulation on rural development programmes which refers to the proposed EU strategic guidelines, contains a number of detailed measures addressing a wide range of priority areas. The format allows flexibility for the continuation of current successful rural development measures as well as the formulation of new ones, by grouping actions under the three main objectives of competitiveness, the environment and the wider rural economy.</P>
        <P>In the case of axis three, the wider rural economy, the overarching objective is one of creating employment opportunities. The range of measures available under this axis should be used to promote the development of rural communities and also to ensure that rural areas remain attractive for future generations. To meet these priorities, the EU strategic guidelines and Council regulation identify key actions such as raising economic activity and employment rates in the wider rural economy, tourism, micro-business and crafts, ICT, child care, training young people in traditional rural skills, developing the use of renewable energy resources, upgrading of local infrastructure. The general provision for basic services for the rural economy and rural population are outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Discussions are currently under way between officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food regarding the preparation of a joint national rural development strategy. The national strategy will form the basis for a new national rural development programme and will focus on the priorities outlined in the EU guidelines. The new programme will contain detailed measures in these key areas. Work on the national rural development programme will begin when the national strategy has been formally adopted, most likely within the next few months, with a view towards completion and approval by the EU Commission by mid-2006.</P>
        <P>A stakeholder consultation on the national strategy and subsequent programme will commence shortly. All bodies represented on the CAP rural development and Leader monitoring committees will be formally notified of this process and fully consulted at all stages of preparation. An advertisement appeared in the newspapers on Monday last &mdash; 24 October &mdash; inviting these, and indeed any other representative organ<Col N="1279"/>isations wishing to contribute to the consultation process, to contact the two Departments.</P>
        <P>Overall, this new approach to rural development and the added emphasis on the wider rural community will enable development of a fuller range of programmes and projects to be supported. This, in turn, should lead to the creation of new enterprises and employment opportunities and help to achieve the Government&rsquo;s objective of balanced regional development and sustainable and vibrant rural communities.</P>

        <P>F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge, which includes representatives of relevant State and voluntary organisations with expertise on a wide range of language policy and practice issues, was established to advise me in relation to: the advisability of preparing a 20-year strategic plan with realistic goals for the Irish language in the State; the short term strategic priorities for the preservation and the promotion of the Irish language within the State; the priorities regarding the implementation of the Official Languages Act; and the best and most practical ways to achieve progress with regard to the implementation of that work.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, I asked members of the F&oacute;ram to submit their views in relation to the development of an Irish language plan and related short-term priority issues. Work on these matters is continuing.</P>
        <P>The matter of the advisability of a 20-year strategic plan for the Irish language has been among the issues which have been considered in general terms by the F&oacute;ram in its deliberations thus far. The need for the provision of a clear statement on the part of the Government in relation to the Irish language and its importance as a whole has emerged as a key issue in this context and I hope to be in a position to elaborate on this issue further in the near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>I fully appreciate the point that the Deputies make as to the importance of supporting the development of social infrastructure, particularly in relation to youth. My Department already provides significant support towards youth based projects through programmes such as the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, community development programme, CDP, the youth services and facilities programme and RAPID as well as supporting initiatives by local drugs task forces.</P>
        <P>Looking ahead I would be happy to look again at the opportunities for improved synergies across programmes such as the LDSIP, the CDP, the social economy programme, the rural social scheme, and RAPID, to strengthen support for social infrastructure, including services for youth.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The designation of voluntary activity units, VAUs, in relevant Departments to support the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary groups is <Col N="1281"/>one of a number of recommendations in the White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity. The tasks envisaged by the White Paper for VAUs include monitoring the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary groups and liaison with these groups regarding policy development and service and programme delivery.</P>
        <P>My Department has been in contact with relevant Departments with a view to ensuring the establishment of supports which, having regard to the nature of the individual departmental relationship with the community and voluntary groups, can best meet the White Paper recommendation. Departments have diverse views on how this can be achieved and on the most appropriate arrangements for their particular circumstances, in light of the extent and nature of their relationship with the community and voluntary activity.</P>
        <P>A number of Departments have designated certain units to function as VAUs. Such examples include the social policy unit in the Department of the Taoiseach; the voluntary and co-operative housing unit in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the voluntary and community services division in my Department and the policy on unemployment unit in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Department of Health and Children has designated a VAU on a cross-divisional basis with representation from the various divisions in the Department dealing with the community and voluntary groups.</P>
        <P>A number of other Departments have several sections-VAUs which interact with community and voluntary groups and include the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs and Education and Science.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this regard, my Department has recently commissioned a study to make recommendations to my Department on practical measures to further advance key principles set out in the White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity such as issues arising in relation to structural matters, including voluntary activity units. Recommendations made will have regard to progress to date in implementing recommendations, major departmental, programme and other innovations by Government in the intervening since the publication of the White Paper, the constitutional, legal, policy and economic responsibilities of Ministers and issues arising in relation to structural matters including the implementation advisory group and voluntary activity units.</P>
        <P>Recommendations will include and address appropriate central arrangements going forward to underpin the interface between public bodies and community and voluntary organisations and requirements to secure appropriate community and voluntary representation.</P>

	<P>The local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, aims to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion. The programme encompasses three action areas services for the unemployed; community development; and community based youth initiatives.</P>
        <P>Within the services for the unemployed sub-measure, actions are developed that aim to counter the effects of long-term unemployment and under-employment. All actions under this sub-measure aim to target individuals most vulnerable in the labour market through a series of locally appropriate approaches.</P>
        <P>The range of supports and the rates of activity for each type of support depend both on the local partnership, and on the individual receiving support, and are based on integrated local development plans which respond to local needs. Individuals receive intensive one-to-one guidance and are supported in a variety of ways depending on their particular abilities. Typical actions include: provision of advice, guidance, and mentoring for those accessing information, employment, education, training and self-employment options; delivery of tailored and flexible training initiatives; development and maintenance of employer and service provider networks; development of self-employment-social economy initiatives which are focused on, and related to, all target groups of the programme; and provision of support to low-income smallholders.</P>
        <P>In the period from 2000 to June 2005, 125,160 people were supported under the services for the unemployed measure. Approximately 18% of these people were supported into taking up employment and 12% were supported into business start-ups. A further 49,226 people participated in education and training programmes, 50% of whom participated in certified education and training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More information on the progression of individuals supported will be available at the end of 2006, when the results of a research study that commenced earlier this year is available. This study aims to assess the impact of the services for the unemployed measure, by identifying the progression outcomes and impacts achieved for a sample of the clients supported and to assess the contribution of the approaches to the work in meeting the programmes' objectives.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 133 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to my response to Questions Nos. 305 and 308 on 8 March 2005, in which I outlined a package of measures to provide support for volunteering. The measures were redesigned to deepen and strengthen the existing volunteering infrastructure, to develop and expand volunteering infrastructure at local and community level, to promote volunteering among young people in second and third level, support the development of an authoritative code of best practice for volunteering and to develop reliable data with regard to volunteering to inform further initiatives. The intention is to sustain and strengthen volunteering in order to create the <Col N="1284"/>time and space to develop a comprehensive national policy in consultation with communities and players in the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept that many reports, including the Oireachtas committee report on volunteering, favour new research on the area. However, there is a view, which I share, that considerable useful up to date information on volunteering already exists at local-bureau level. Rather than commit significant funding at this juncture to new research programmes, the new development officer, recently recruited by Volunteer Centres Ireland under one of the funding measures I have already mentioned, should seek to develop this information into useful local and national statistics. I understand that this work is getting under way.</P>
        <P>The ultimate objective of a policy on volunteering is to inspire and encourage people to actively participate in the development of their communities. This key principle of active citizenship underpins not only my approach to volunteering but also the local and community development programmes operated by my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 134 together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies are aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-08. The strategy contains 108 individual actions to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>As I have outlined to this House on a number of occasions, I am confident that, through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the drugs task forces, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the local drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in its area based on its own identified priorities, and as informed by its local communities.</P>
        <P>These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs, including cocaine. We have to be aware that many drug users engage in poly-drug use and, therefore, projects should be able to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrate on one drug only.</P>
        <P>The regional drugs task forces, covering all parts of the country that are not serviced by a local drugs task force, have been allocated funding to advance the implementation of action plans in their areas, including tackling cocaine.</P>
        <P>With regard to treatment, Deputies may be aware that there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the most effective treatments available. In this context the health services have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers over the last number of years.</P>
        <P>On the prevention side, the ongoing national awareness campaign on drugs continues to address the issue of cocaine through a well-received campaign. The campaign aims to tackle the perception held by some that cocaine use is safe. The garda&iacute; and Customs and Excise continue to target cocaine dealers and there have been significant seizures of cocaine in recent years.</P>
        <P>The drug prevalence survey, jointly carried out by the national advisory committee on drugs and the drugs and alcohol information and research unit in Northern Ireland, is generally regarded as <Col N="1286"/>providing the most reliable baseline data on drug prevalence in Ireland. That study, which was carried out between October 2002 and April 2003, surveyed 8,442 people aged from 15 to 64 and reported that 3% of the population had used cocaine during their lifetime, 1.1% had used it in the previous 12 months and 0.3% used in the previous month. Similar surveys undertaken in other European countries would suggest that Ireland is roughly average in terms of use.</P>
        <P>As I have informed the House previously, I am also aware of other evidence of a continuing increase in the prevalence of cocaine use, particularly through the work of the garda&iacute;, the Health Research Board and the national advisory committee on drugs. In this regard, it is planned to repeat the drug prevalence survey in 2006.</P>
        <P>The increase in Ireland would appear to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally, as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in the street price. Additional funding of almost &euro;400,000 was recently provided by me to support a series of pilot proposals aimed at tackling cocaine use in local communities. These initiatives are: training for front line staff; production of educational material outlining the dangers associated with cocaine use; and four treatment projects each targeting a different aspect of cocaine use.</P>
        <P>All of the pilot projects are being implemented currently and an external evaluator has been engaged by my Department to assess their progress and impact. While it is too early to assess the impact of the programmes, I understand that general feedback on the projects is positive. I can assure Deputies that the Government will continue to monitor the cocaine situation closely and to take any steps found necessary as a result.</P>

        <P>Deputies will also be aware that, arising from the tri-ministerial review of structures involved in the delivery of local and community development <Col N="1287"/>programmes, the Government decided that community and local development groups across urban, rural and Gaeltacht areas should be requested to bring forward measures for improved alignment of structures in their respective areas.

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in 2004 I introduced a new delivery mechanism to support small-scale local actions in RAPID areas, through co-funding with other Departments-agencies. Allocations by my Department to the Cork City RAPID area of Togher-Mahon under the RAPID leverage fund for co-funded measure for this year are as follows: RAPID health sector co-fund &mdash;&euro;60,000; local authority housing estate enhancement scheme 2005-06 &mdash;&euro;45,000; traffic measures &mdash;&euro;22,500; playground grants scheme 2005 &mdash;&euro;33,000; and top-up funding under sports capital grant 2005 &mdash;&euro;111,000. It should be noted that additional funding totalling &euro;170,500 was provided by other Departments and agencies to support these measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the first six months of 2005, an allocation of &euro;14,000 was made by dormant accounts to one of the projects from the Togher-Mahon RAPID plans. In addition, the Dormant Accounts Board has allocated another &euro;528,434 to projects in Togher-Mahon.</P>

        <P>The position is that the underspend referred to by the Deputy arose primarily due to factors relating to the suspensions of the institutions in Northern Ireland and the deferral of the building of the new Waterways Ireland headquarters in Enniskillen, which is now due to commence in 2006, and the new regional office in Scarriff, which commenced earlier this year. In the event of an underspend under any heading, the money is either re-allocated to other projects within the Vote or surrendered to the Exchequer. In the case of deferral, a further provision is re-entered in the Vote the following year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies may be aware, rehabilitation emerged as a key issue during the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy. The conclusion of the steering group overseeing the review, with which I agree, was that the strategy&rsquo;s rehabilitation provisions needed to be strengthened and expanded, particularly in light of the significant and ongoing expansion in treatment provision in recent years. Accordingly, the report of the steering group recommended that rehabilitation become the fifth pillar of the strategy. To progress this, it was further recommended that a working group, under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht <Col N="1290"/>Affairs, be established to develop a strategy for the provision of integrated rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>This group has been established and includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies involved in delivering rehabilitation services as well as the national drugs strategy team, NDST, the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, and representatives from the community and voluntary sectors. The group is examining the provision of existing rehabilitation services in Ireland and will seek to identify existing best practice as well as gaps in current services. The final report of the group will recommend actions to develop an integrated rehabilitation service.</P>
        <P>To date, the group has had one formal meeting and have also conducted two days of consultation meetings with various stakeholders and experts in the field of rehabilitation. Following this, its second formal meeting is being held today. It is envisaged that the working group will complete its report by the end of the year and that its recommendations will be considered by the inter-departmental group on drugs and the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion early in 2006.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that, arising from the tri-ministerial review of structures involved in the delivery of local and community development programmes, the Government decided that community and local development groups across urban, rural and Gaeltacht areas should be requested to bring forward measures for improved alignment of structures in their respective areas. Funding was earmarked to support specific co-ordinated measures emerging from this process.</P>
        <P>The core objective of this funding for 2005 and 2006 is the alignment of local, community and <Col N="1291"/>rural development structures to achieve full county-city coverage of local and rural development programmes by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>In rural areas, this will involve Leader and partnership, including community partnership, groups coming together to develop a unified structure where they have not already done so based, as far as possible, around county boundaries &mdash; in city areas around contiguous electoral areas &mdash; with strong linkages to community based groups. The intention is to have simplified local delivery structures with improved coverage and levels of service locally.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The symposium in Notre Dame was a significant occasion, which attracted an audience from across the United States and speakers from a number of distinguished universities in that country. Irish is taught in 25 universities in the USA and the attendance at the conference reflected that high level of interest in the language there. My speech looked at the history of the Irish language, its value as the oldest spoken and written language in Europe north of the Alps and as part of the common cultural heritage of all humanity. My speech also covered the measures currently under way to strengthen the future of the language, including the implementation of the Official Languages Act and securing of status as an official and working EU language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the conference I announced the launch of a special fund of &euro;300,000 that will support the development of Irish language programmes in third level institutions overseas. I gave further details on this fund in my reply to Question No. 92 of today. While it is a matter for the organisers of the conference rather than myself, I understand that the proceedings of the conference will be published and I will be pleased to arrange to have a copy supplied to the Deputy in due course.</P>

        <P>Expenditure up to 25 October 2005 across the three main programme areas, excluding administration, is &euro;214.3 million, which can broadly be broken down as follows: An Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht &mdash;&euro;54.3 million; community affairs &mdash;&euro;98.2 million; and rural affairs &mdash;&euro;61.8 million.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Official Languages Act 2003 was signed into law in July 2003. The Act is the first piece of legislation to provide a statutory framework for the delivery of improved levels and standards of public services through the Irish language by public bodies. I, as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, have a general responsibility to ensure such services are made available.</P>
        <P>The main objective of the Act will be achieved principally through the statutory obligation on Departments and public bodies to make specific provision for delivery of such services in a coherent and agreed fashion, by means of a statutory planning framework known as a scheme, to be agreed on a three-year renewable basis between the head of the body concerned and the Minister. I have already confirmed a number of such schemes and this process will continue to be rolled out, on a phased basis, by my Department. Some 650 public bodies are covered by the provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Act also specifies some basic general provisions of universal applicability, for example, correspondence to be replied to in the official language in which it was written; provision of information to the public in the Irish language, or in the Irish and English languages; bilingual publications of certain key documents; use of Irish in the courts and so forth.</P>
        <P>In July 2000, the Government approved the adoption of official languages equality as one of three new principles for quality customer services. This principle specifies that the State sector will provide quality services through Irish and-or bilingually and will inform customers of their right under this principle to choose to be dealt with through one or other of the official languages.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that Foras na Gaeilge has a statutory role and responsibility in relation to providing advice and assistance to public bodies in respect of delivery of services through the Irish language. Foras na Gaeilge has prepared a substantial amount of resource material for public bodies, including Irish language versions of standard forms and other text. In this regard, An Coiste T&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta, which comes under the aegis of Foras na Gaeilge, is <Col N="1294"/>responsible for term creation and offers authoritative advice in relation to any technical terms not available on the website or in any of the specialist dictionaries.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is continuing to work with Foras na Gaeilge and other interested parties to put resources and systems in place in relation to priority areas for attention, such as quality assurance of translation services, an accreditation system for Irish language training, specialist Irish language training courses, an electronic database of standard signage and so forth.</P>
        <P>Gaeleagras na Seirbh&iacute;se Poibl&iacute; continues to make a significant contribution to the promotion and development of the Irish language in the Civil Service through the provision, <i>inter alia</i>, of a range of language training courses.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I established Comhairle na Tuaithe in January 2004 to address the three issues of: access to the countryside; developing a countryside code; and developing a national countryside recreation strategy. Comhairle na Tuaithe comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and state bodies with an interest in the countryside. Comhairle na Tuaithe reported to me on 27 July 2005 on its work to date. In its report Comhairle na Tuaithe has identified and agreed a set of access parameters to the countryside, which it believes will serve as a basis for conflict prevention and which integrates a variety of needs and responsibilities.</P><Col N="1296"/>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe has also agreed the key features necessary for countryside code development, with a focus on the potential application of the internationally-recognised Leave No Trace initiative. Leave No Trace is an international outdoor ethics programme, which explains to visitors their role in caring for themselves, others and the environment, while visiting the countryside, forest or other areas of outdoor recreation. Comhairle na Tuaithe is currently working in partnership with stakeholder organisations to develop a national countryside recreation strategy.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar questions in this House, no formal costings have been done in regard to the full implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 on the basis that such an exercise would not be useful or practicable in advance of consideration on a case-by-case basis by each public body of what, if any, specific additional costs might arise for it. It is clear that there will be some cost issues involved, particularly at start-up, but in the normal course these should in the main be met from within existing administrative allocations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Act is being implemented on a planned and pragmatic basis. Clearly, some costs will arise in connection with such matters as training and translation services. However, the position for individual public bodies, or indeed on an overall basis, cannot be established until individual schemes have been agreed in accordance with the legislation. In this regard, as the Deputy will be aware, I have confirmed a number of such schemes during 2005. These schemes take a pragmatic and realistic approach to the provision of improved services through Irish, and they also take account of the ability of the public bodies to deliver improved services within the existing human and financial resources available to them. As is the case with the commitments contained in my own Department&rsquo;s scheme, the commitments contained in these schemes are being delivered from within the overall budget available to the public bodies concerned in the relevant years and do not create any significant extra costs.</P>
        <P>Circumstances will vary greatly from public body to public body in regard to demand for delivery of services through Irish. Indeed, some public bodies will be better placed than others in <Col N="1297"/>regard to having the resources to meet this demand, given that they already operate, to varying degrees, a policy of bilingualism. It is, however, a matter for each public body in the first instance to ensure that resources are assigned in order to comply with the provisions of this particular legislation in the same way as resources are assigned to ensure compliance with obligations imposed by other legislation and by the requirements to provide quality customer service.</P>
        <P>The question of providing funding for specific administrative costs for individual public bodies, regardless of whether these relate to the Official Languages Act or any other service delivery or policy obligation arising, falls to be assessed against formal business cases or proposals submitted as part of the normal annual estimate and budget cycle. Given the position of Irish as the first constitutional language, the objective is to ensure that delivery of public services by public bodies, including provision of information about services and activities through the Irish language, is seen as a normal requirement to meet good standards of customer service and corporate governance, rather than an optional extra or add-on.</P>

	<P>In November 2004, expressions of interest were sought by my Department from operators interested in providing a cargo ferry service between Ros an Mh&iacute;l and the Aran Islands for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. Subsequently in March of this year, following a pre-qualification process, tender documents for this service were issued to a number of operators with a deadline of 1 July 2005 for receipt of tenders.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the external evaluation of the tenders received, the inter-agency steering committee, established to oversee the award of this and certain other Aran Islands transport service contracts, recommended that this particular tender competition should be terminated. In making this recommendation, regard was had to a number of issues which had arisen since tenders had been sought last March, including rapidly altering circumstances in relation to infrastructure developments at Ros &aacute; Mh&iacute;l, and the decision taken in August 2005 to reduce the cargo tariffs to be charged to islanders in the operation of the service by 50%, thus rendering the pricing structure as sought in the original tender out of date.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the provision of a cargo service to the Aran Islands for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011 is being kept under review pending the outcome of discussions with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in relation to progress of the development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l harbour. My Department also proposes to initiate shortly a study on the feasibility of providing a roll on-roll off ferry service to these islands, the findings of which will also be material to the process. In the meantime, as the Deputy will be aware, the provision of freight services to the Aran Islands is being maintained with assistance from my Department</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Officials of my Department work on a regular basis with Foras na Gaeilge and other interested parties, including the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, and Gaeleagras na Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Poibl&iacute;, in order to put in place resources and systems to help public bodies improve, over time, both the level and standard of services they provide to the general public through the Irish language. In this context, I was delighted to officially launch, earlier this month, two specialised courses which have been developed by the IPA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to recent reports in the media in relation to compliance by Departments with the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003, I am assured that any impression given that the view of the IPA is that there could be an unwillingness in Departments and other public bodies to provide services through Irish is not correct. On the contrary, the IPA has made it very clear to my Department that its experience shows enthusiastic support for getting the arrangements in place to provide bilingual services for the public. While a number of public bodies report a <Col N="1300"/>lack of proficiency or confidence among staff in dealing with queries in Irish, the facts are that some 250 officials from across the public service have attended IPA seminars or courses in respect of the Act&rsquo;s requirements and the response to the courses has been most encouraging.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Official Languages Act 2003 works in two ways. First, there are certain provisions that apply directly to all public bodies. Second, there are the statutory schemes that all public bodies must, when requested to do so by me, as Minister, draw up and submit for agreement. In this context, it must be clearly understood, as I have stated repeatedly, that some organisations in the public sector have limited capabilities and resources from the point of view of providing services through Irish at present. Consequently, the schemes that I have approved to date take a pragmatic and realistic approach to the provision of improved services through Irish, and also take account of the ability of the public bodies to deliver improved services within the existing human and financial resources available to them.</P>
        <P>The agreed schemes also show what each public body is going to do to ensure that any services not currently provided by the body through Irish will be provided over the longer term. The Act therefore incorporates a planning mechanism to ensure that the constitutional rights of Irish speakers to obtain public services through Irish are met. As I have often said in the past and wish to reiterate again today, the implementation of the Act is a long-term planning project to be pursued in line with the resources available to public bodies and the demand for services through Irish from the public.</P>

	<P>In 2003, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, on behalf of my Department, placed a call for broadband proposals in CL&Aacute;R areas. Some 15 centres were identified for a pilot trial of broadband technology in selected industrial estates, business and educational-training centres in the CL&Aacute;R regions.</P><Col N="1302"/>
        <P>Following technical and financial evaluations, 12 locations were identified to receive broadband from funding of almost &euro;400,000 approved under the CL&Aacute;R programme. Grant aid of 55% maximum applied for projects in the BMW region and 30% maximum in the south and east region. The actual cost of the roll-out in 2004, with associated evaluation costs, was &euro;353,000. The 12 locations &mdash; Boyle, Carlingford, Cootehill, Mohill, Tubbercurry, Lismore, Tulla, Ballycastle, Clifden, Corraun, Carna and Kilcar &mdash; are benefiting from high speed broadband connections at speeds equal to or better than most current market offerings, using the latest high speed wireless and satellite technologies.</P>
        <P>In addition in 2003, following discussions with the BMW regional assembly, my Department agreed to fund, under the CL&Aacute;R programme, a wireless based Internet service for three projects covering five locations in CL&Aacute;R areas in the BMW region at the rate of 80%, &euro;254,709, of the total cost.</P>
        <P>The projects are: Dungloe, County Donegal, Killala, County Mayo and Enniscrone, County Sligo, Lanesborough, County Longford and Ballyleague, County Roscommon. At the end of 2004, the three projects were up and running. It is expected that, by the end of 2005, close to the full draw-down of funding will have been achieved on all three projects.</P>
        <P>In addition, CL&Aacute;R and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are developing proposals to co-fund the supply of town fibre optic networks to the industrial parks in Belmullet, County Mayo and Dungloe, County Donegal. The Belmullet project is completed and will benefit from CL&Aacute;R funding of over &euro;75,000. Discussions are ongoing on the Dungloe project.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to place any further calls for broadband proposal in CL&Aacute;R areas as, having consulted with Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it advised that the county and group broadband schemes, run by that Department, amply accommodate broadband supply to rural areas.</P>
        <P>The objective of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources schemes is to promote the roll-out of broadband access through the establishment of sustainable broadband services in towns, villages, rural hinterlands and under served areas of larger towns on the basis of local-regional authority co-ordination and community driven initiatives. They are open to all smaller and rural communities of less than 1,500 people. This enables local communities to work with a broadband service provider of their own choice, or to draw up and implement their own broadband plan, with the aim of launching a broadband service for residents and small and medium sized businesses in their area.</P>

The revocation did not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts at that time remained in place.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme, LTI. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness, for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>The medical card, GMS, and drugs payment, DPS, schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme, DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s virtual private network, VPN, contract was awarded on foot of an open EU procurement exercise to a consortium comprising Eircom and Vodafone Ireland in May 2002 for five years. The contract provides for a range of voice and data telecommunications services, including secure interconnectivity between public bodies. It was procured by a cross-sectoral procurement working group, comprising Departments and offices, and the health, local authority and education sectors. The procurement exercise aggregated all of the civil and non-commercial public sector telecommunications demand because that approach ensures that the public service receives maximum value for money and substantial savings in its telecommunications expenditure as a result of the significant discounts available from such an approach. As part of its management process, the contract has built-in reviews and roll-over procedures that are now conducted on an annual basis by a programme board comprising the same entities that operated the initial procurement exercise.</P>
        <P>The contract established a drawdown facility that allows Departments and offices and public bodies to drawdown services at their discretion and does not preclude them from operating public procurement exercises for telecommunications services at any time. Many of them do this with the aid of telecommunications specialists in my Department. Additionally, my Department has ensured that all other major telecommunications service providers can connect to the Government VPN to allow for the maximum competition in the provision of these services to public bodies. As the contract is a drawdown facility and because each public body has a great deal of discretion in its procurement of telecommunications services, my Department does not have detailed knowledge of the extent of usage or value of the services available under the VPN contract. My Department does, however, aid individual public bodies in ensuring that they get best value for money in their telecommunications expenditure either under the VPN contract or through separate procurements.</P>
        <P>It is not intended to take this contract, in this shape, to public tender again. Recent changes in EU procurement law and the emergence of enhanced competition in the Irish marketplace <Col N="1314"/>now facilitate the use of frameworks involving multiple competing providers. In this context, it is intended to operate a series of such framework procurement exercises over the coming 12 to 18 months. This series of procurements will, over time, deal with all aspects of telecommunications services provision to the public sector. Strategies for these procurements are being worked out at present and it is intended to complete the first of these exercises in early 2006.</P>

        <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are committed to improving the timeliness of tax-based information and continue to pursue technical and other approaches to facilitate this. Ultimately, however, the timeliness of data is determined by the dates for filing of tax returns and the processes that must be gone through to reach an acceptable standard. In this regard the apparent advantage of producing more recent tax and incomes data could be offset by a deterioration in completeness and would not necessarily improve upon the current arrangement.</P>

	<P>Government policy in relation <Col N="1318"/>to the regional harbours as recently published in the ports policy statement is that the continued operation of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance.</P>
        <P>The policy statement states that the regional harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership as many of the regional harbours have neither the resources nor the capability to comply with aspects of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies whereas their transfer to local authority control would bring improved corporate governance and allow the harbours to realise their amenity potential.</P>
        <P>The ports policy statement drew on the review of State regional ports and harbours, carried out by KPMG in 1999, which analysed trading, financial and governance issues at the harbours and recommended the transfer of certain regional harbours to local authority control. In accordance with Government policy Sligo is designated for transfer to Sligo County Council.</P>
        <P>This Department is working with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate the implementation of the ports policy statement in this regard. It is intended to make arrangements for the transfer of the designated regional harbours to their respective local authorities, where appropriate, and to proceed individually in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and the harbour authorities having regard to local requirements in each case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002 the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources initiated a national coastal protection strategy study to review coastal protection generally, examine policy options and set out a basis for effective decision making in regard to resource allocation. This study is currently in progress. Attention is at present being focused on detailed studies in a pilot area of coast stretching from Killiney, County Dublin to Carnsore Point, County Wexford.</P>
        <P>In the pilot area information is being assembled on the current and historic position of the coastline, the nature of the coast, its vulnerability to erosion and flooding and the nature of the hinterland in terms of economic, heritage and environmental assets. The information is being collated on a geographic information system, GIS.</P>
        <P>Areas at risk of tidal flooding in the pilot area are being delineated at two levels of probability. An extreme flood outline, EFO, is being determined for the combined storm surge and high tide event with a 0.1% annual excellence probability. Converted into a band on a digital terrain model, this will define the outer limit for damage estimates and planning guidance. High tide, surge and wave inundation levels with an annual excellence probability of 0.5% are being determined which will show on the GIS the indicative flood plain.</P><Col N="1320"/>
        <P>Very limited data are available on storm surges around the coast of Ireland so it is necessary to develop a hydrodynamic tidal model to simulate tides and surges from historical meteorological data. Storm surge modelling is ongoing. All events identified as extreme storm surges between 1956 and 2002 have been simulated and water levels have been extracted at locations in the Irish Sea along the pilot area coastline.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P Just="Left">It is intended that following completion of the pilot study the surge modelling and identification of areas at risk will be extended to the entire coastline of Ireland including Dublin. Land use restrictions, if any, resulting from these studies are a matter for the relevant planning authority. This Department will advise the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government on impacts and sensitivity of erosion and flood risk in relation to planning and development, including the provision of assistance as required in the development of guidelines and standards.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>In 2003 this Department provided funding to Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council towards the cost of the Dublin coastal flooding protection project. This project which was initiated following the tidal flooding which occurred in Dublin in February 2002 is aimed primarily at addressing the risks from tidal flooding around the Dublin coastline and within the tidal reaches of a number of rivers and canals. A copy of the final report of these studies was received in this Department in April 2005 and is currently being reviewed.</P>

	<P>Mr Se&aacute;n Garland was arrested by the PSNI in Belfast on 7 October. At the time of his arrest, Irish officials at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast were asked to seek clarification from the British authorities as to the basis for his arrest. It was indicated that Mr. Garland was provisionally arrested on foot of a request from the United States Government for his extradition. The request for extradition was made on the basis that Mr. Garland is the subject of an indictment filed on 19 May 2005 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The United States authorities want Mr. Garland to stand trial on counterfeiting charges.</P>
        <P>Mr Garland has been released on bail subject to the payment of surety and daily reporting to a PSNI station. Mr. Garland has also been instructed to reside at an address in Northern Ireland pending the receipt of appropriate documentation from the US authorities to support the extradition request. I understand that the documentation must be forwarded to the UK authorities within 65 days of the date of the initial request for extradition, that is within 65 days from 4 October 2005.</P>
        <P>At their request, on 20 October I met a number of public representatives who had concerns about the case. I confirmed that we will continue to monitor the case. I emphasised that Mr. Garland has the same rights as any other citizen, including being fully entitled to due process and to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. The United States authorities are now aware of the interest of the Government in this case. However, as the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said in the D&aacute;il in the Adjournment Debate on 20 October, the Government is not in a position to interfere in legal proceedings that are taking place in another jurisdiction. Such matters are for the courts alone to decide and therefore further comment on the details of the case would be inappropriate at this time.</P>

	<P>I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, in Dublin on 19 October when we jointly chaired a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. This was the first meeting of the conference since June, when it met at summit level. We had a useful and constructive meeting. I was accompanied by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The Secretary of State was <Col N="1325"/>accompanied by <?oasys _cl11.5-?>Ministers David Hanson and Shaun Woodward of the Northern Ireland Office.</P>
        <P>The conference reviewed recent political developments and reaffirmed its belief that the restoration of devolved government on an inclusive basis was in the best interests of all in Northern Ireland. It also welcomed the recent confirmation by the IICD that IRA weapons had been fully and verifiably decommissioned, and it likewise noted the seventh report of the International Monitoring Commission which was published on the same day.</P>
        <P>The two Governments agreed to consult with the parties over the coming weeks to take stock of progress to date and to help build momentum towards the restoration of devolved government on an inclusive basis. We had a valuable discussion on current policing issues and reiterated the commitment of the two Governments to fully implementing the Patten report. We agreed that a sustained effort was required by all parties to build consensus on policing and to secure support for the police from the entire community.</P>
        <P>We also discussed the recent upsurge in sectarian attacks and in street violence. Both governments strongly condemned all sectarian crime and intimidation. We agreed that the type of sectarian violence and intimidation witnessed in recent months was totally unacceptable, and called on political leaders to use their influence to bring this violence to an end. The conference also strongly condemned the violence resulting from the loyalist feud.</P>
        <P>We discussed the question of parades, welcoming that most parades had passed off peacefully this summer and condemning the violence and rioting that had taken place on a limited number of occasions. In this regard, we paid tribute to the work of the Northern Ireland Parades Commission in managing contentious parades this summer and throughout its term of office.</P>
        <P>Both Governments reiterated their resolve to advance work in the areas of equality and human rights. We affirmed our joint commitment to tackling inequality and disadvantage on the basis of objective need. In that context, the conference also reviewed progress on tackling the differential in unemployment between the two communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The conference had a positive discussion on the ongoing work of the North-South bodies and of the British-Irish Council. I particularly welcome the agreement we reached in principle on the extension of the all-island travel scheme throughout the island. We also discussed progress towards the creation of a single electricity market by July 2007 and to tackling the issue of inadvertent mobile telephone roaming charges, an issue which affects businesses and communities on both sides of the Border. The conference also welcomed the recent agreement to review the feasibility of restoring a section of the Ulster Canal, a project that would bring real economic <Col N="1326"/>benefit to communities on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P>We also endorsed the practical ongoing co-operation between the two Governments and between the relevant authorities on public health emergency planning, particularly in the context of the current concerns about the spread of avian influenza. We also expressed our support for efforts to bring the World Rally Championship to Ireland in 2007. The joint communiqu&eacute; which was issued after the conference outlines in detail the issues we discussed. A copy of this communiqu&eacute; has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. The next meeting of the conference is due to take place in early January.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the situation in Maluku, known to many as the Moluccas, in eastern Indonesia. Violence erupted between Christian and Muslim communities in 1999, resulting in the deaths of as many as 5,000 people since then and the displacement of many more. A peace agreement brokered in 2002 by the current Indonesian Vice-Pres<Col N="1327"/>ident, Jusuf Kalla, substantially reduced the violence and reports indicate that the human rights situation has improved since 2003.</P>
        <P>However, on 25 April 2004 violence erupted again, resulting in the deaths of 38 people in the city of Ambon, after a small group of independence supporters held a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of a short-lived separatist struggle in 1950. Sporadic outbreaks of violence throughout 2005 including the attack on a security post on the island of Ceram in May 2005, killing seven people, show that the peace remains fragile.</P>
        <P>The Government believes the most productive approach to dealing with human rights in Maluku and similar situations in other areas of conflict in Indonesia including in Aceh and in Papua is through contact with the Government of Indonesia.</P>
        <P>Ireland and our EU partners continue to monitor the political situation in Indonesia and human rights issues are regularly raised in discussions with the Indonesian authorities. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, did so in his meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, in the margins of the UN General Assembly in September 2004. These concerns had previously been raised with Mr. Wirajuda in April 2004, during an EU Troika meeting held during the Irish Presidency of the EU. The EU Troika of Foreign Ministers again met Mr. Wirajuda in Jakarta on 10 March 2005. Human rights issues were discussed at these meetings also. EU heads of mission in Jakarta also raise human rights issues during regular political dialogue meetings with the Indonesian authorities.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting on 11 October 2004, adopted conclusions on Indonesia which reiterated the EU&rsquo;s attachment to a united, democratic, stable and prosperous Indonesia and also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s respect for the territorial integrity of Indonesia. The Council encouraged the Indonesian Government to seek peaceful solutions in conflict and potential conflict areas. Together with our EU partners, the Government will continue to monitor closely the situation and raise human rights concerns regarding Maluku in our discussions with the Indonesian authorities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Government agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-term stay charges. As I previously announced, these repayments will not impact on the current pension entitlements of affected persons. It will be a matter for pensioners themselves to decide what they do with any repayments received and they can, if they wish, deposit the <Col N="1334"/>moneys involved in any number of accounts. For means test purposes, once my Department has confirmed that such a repayment was received, an amount equivalent to that repayment will be exempt from assessment for pension purposes provided the pensioner owns capital equal to or in excess of the repayment sum. Where the pensioner&rsquo;s capital is less than the sum repaid all of the pensioner&rsquo;s capital will be exempt. These arrangements will also apply in those cases where a deciding officer of my Department is required to make a revised decision on entitlement following the death of a recipient of a social assistance payment. These arrangements will apply only in those cases where a repayment was made by the Health Service Executive. The current capital assessment arrangements will continue to apply to all other persons and situations.</P>
        <P>Over the period in question, my Department paid affected persons their full pension and other social welfare entitlements and had no function in the deduction of the charges made. Given the unique background to the repayments, the Government decided that receipt of the lump sums involved would not incur a tax liability or adversely affect future entitlement to health services and social welfare payments in the case of those who were charged and are still alive. I will make the necessary legislative changes to bring the social welfare aspects of this decision into effect when full details of the repayment scheme have been finalised.</P>

	<P>My Department assists and encourages long-term unemployed, and other welfare recipients including persons in receipt of widow-widower non-contributory pension to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service.</P>
        <P>One significant measure is the back to work allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages people to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>Another measure offered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service is the back-to-education allowance programme which provides support to long term social welfare recipients who need to obtain educational qualifications before re-entering the labour force. In addition, a special <Col N="1335"/>projects fund, administered by my Department&rsquo;s locally based facilitators provides enhanced support to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment. The facilitators also operate small-scale family services projects in certain areas, which are designed to focus supports towards specific target groups with complex needs. The provision of this additional support involves individual attention, customised information and enhanced access to services. It can increase the capacity of those in the most difficult circumstances, to improve their self-esteem and personal situations through access to basic education, training and developmental opportunities. It is hoped that by encouraging customers to participate in self development programmes and in some instances &ldquo;taster&rdquo; educational programmes that they will move on to more formalised training and educational programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The special projects and family services initiatives are based on the application of a partnership approach between my Department, the voluntary and community sector, the private sector and other local players in identifying and addressing local needs in terms of training and development for people dependent on social welfare payments including the widow-widowers non-contributory pension. So far this year, the &euro;1.6 million has been accessed through the special projects fund and &euro;1.3 million from the family services project to support these initiatives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed measures to give effect to the strategies to combat child poverty in Ireland are set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and in the national children&rsquo;s strategy. Ending child poverty is also one of ten special initiatives in Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>The most significant measure to support families with children in recent years has been the substantial real increases in child benefit payment rates. Between 1997 and 2005, the rate of child benefit rose from &euro;38.09 per month for the first two children and &euro;49.52 for each child thereafter to &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. This equates to real increases in excess of 170%. Child benefit is paid to over 540,000 families in respect of approximately 1 million children, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.9 billion in 2005. It delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family <Col N="1336"/>regardless of income levels or employment status. Providing income support in this way creates no obstacles to employment and facilitates employment take-up by providing significant support with child care costs.</P>
        <P>Through the family income supplement scheme, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay. Recent improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for more lower-income households to qualify under the scheme. In a significant proportion of households with children, there is no full-time or part-time employment. These households mainly include recipients of the one parent family payment, or of payments in respect of disability and unemployment. In other households with bigger families, only one parent may be able to take up employment, which results in a lower family income. A study is currently being carried out by the NESC into the possibility of amalgamating child dependent allowances and family income supplement into a second tier of child income support aimed at families on low incomes. A sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion has been undertaking a detailed examination of obstacles to employment for lone parents. As part of this work, my Department is nearing the completion of a review of income supports and I hope to complete this work in the near future.</P>
        <P>The provision of affordable and flexible child care is also a key factor in facilitating employment participation for families with children. My Department is participating in an inter-departmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children.</P>
        <P>We also need to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of the policies being pursued on the development of our children and get the necessary evidence on what works and works well. This process is about to commence with a major national longitudinal study on children. My Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the National Children&rsquo;s Office, are jointly funding this study. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study.</P>
        <P>I am confident that, through the measures already being taken and the initiatives being planned, we can make a major contribution to <Col N="1337"/>ensuring that vulnerable families and their children have a fair share of life chances and quality of life.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As my predecessor pointed out in reply to Question No. 636 on 27 April 2004, in the context of preparing the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill 1997, consideration was given to providing the former Aer Rianta with power to make orders declaring particular areas of land in the vicinity of airports to be protected areas, where unrestricted use of such lands could interfere with the safety of aircraft. Under section 14 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950, the power to make such orders rested with the Minister. However, in the course of consultations on the drafting of the Bill, it was decided that the <i>status quo</i> operated satisfactorily and the ministerial power under the 1950 Act to make protected area orders was retained and remains in force. The Bill was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted in 1998.</P>
        <P>The issue of planning objections or appeals lodged by the former Aer Rianta and any future such actions by the Dublin Airport Authority falls within the remit of the company and of the planning authorities.</P>

	<P>The provision of transport services for older people in rural areas is a core feature of the rural transport initiative, RTI, which has been operated by my Department since 2002. All 34 RTI pilot projects throughout the country provide transport services for older people as part of their public transport remit. The RTI arose as a response to the needs of specific categories of people in rural Ireland, such as older people, who did not have access to transport.</P>
        <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, administers the RTI on behalf of my Department and together with the individual RTI project groups are solely responsible for all the operational aspects of the initiative including the specific services to be provided. Neither I nor my Department has any role in these matters.</P>
        <P>In line with the principal recommendation of the appraisal of the RTI in 2004, I announced the extension of the initiative to end 2006. I have also announced my intention to make the RTI permanent from 2007 onwards.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I understand, based on information from the Department of Foreign Affairs, that the investigation by the UN human rights committee mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question may be the periodic appearance by the Government of the US at the human rights committee meeting in Geneva, which is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The US, like all states which are party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, submits periodic reports to the human rights committee on its compliance with its obligations under the ICCPR. A delegation representing the state party then appears at a session of the committee and answers questions from committee members on its periodic report. Non-governmental organisations are invited to submit comments or shadow reports on the reports submitted by their governments. This is the normal practice of the committee.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans to carry out inspections of US aircraft carrying military personnel landing at Shannon Airport. Inspections of aircraft for safety reasons are the responsibility <Col N="1340"/>of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. Requests for exemptions under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, amended in 1989, are received from civilian air carriers carrying military troops with their personal weapons and-or carrying munitions. As the day-to-day oversight of aviation safety falls within the remit of the IAA, all applications under the above order, including details of the cargo carried, are submitted to the IAA for their observations. The IAA ensures all such requests are compliant with current safety regulations for the safe transport of these goods by air as approved by International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.</P>
        <P>These applications are also sent to the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs for their observations, and to the Department of Defence for information. Should any of these bodies express an objection to the operation of these flights, I would refuse to grant an exemption under the 1973 order.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy, which is implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. My area of responsibility also covers the national drugs strategy team, NDST, which oversees the work of the local and regional drugs task forces and the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD. The 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, oversee a range of community and voluntary sector projects in their areas of operation, including the provision of support and guidance to these projects in the delivery of their services. Upon implementation of their action plans, the regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, which cover all parts of the country not serviced by a LDTF, will perform a similar task. The task forces are in turn supported and guided by the NDST which identifies and considers policy issues arising out of the work of the LDTFs and RDTFs.</P>
        <P>In addition, the NACD advises the Government in relation to the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland. Its membership reflects statutory, community, voluntary, academic and research interests as well as representation from the relevant Departments. In this context, the NACD has produced research on issues of relevance to service providers, including community and voluntary organisations. This research covered such areas as homelessness and drugs use, harm reduction approaches, dual diagnosis as well as an ongoing longitudinal study which is seeking to assess the outcomes from a range of treatments for heroin misusers. Arising from these reports, which are widely disseminated, they make recommendations on various issues, including best practice in the relevant area.</P>
        <?oasys _cl12-?>
        <P>The NACD has also run a community grants research scheme to develop research capacity among community groups as well as to increase the knowledge base at a local level. It has also held a seminar for community groups on guidelines for conducting local research into drug prevalence. I am satisfied the existing structures adequately address the issues of community support and policy formulation in regard to the misuse of drugs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Through the CL&Aacute;R programme, my Department has continued in 2005 to address depopulation, as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. The programme covers areas in 18 counties, with a population of 362,000, including areas I announced in January 2003 in light of the 2002 population census data. The average population loss in the selected areas is 50%. The exception is the Cooley peninsula, which was included on <Col N="1345"/>the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease.</P>
        <P>CL&Aacute;R funds or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures and reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the start of the programme. I intend to continue these procedures for any new measures I may introduce, depending on needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.</P>
        <P>Expenditure under the CL&Aacute;R programme amounted to &euro;14.14 million in 2002, &euro;8.613 million in 2003 and &euro;12.116 million in 2004 which, it is estimated, leveraged out a further &euro;36.5 million in related public and private expenditure in those three years. The financial provision for 2005 is &euro;13.7 million and, once again, a comprehensive work programme will be completed this year. I am satisfied that the needs of the people in the CL&Aacute;R areas are being met through the efficient and effective delivery of the programme and that CL&Aacute;R is making a sustained and strong positive contribution to rural communities.</P>
        <P>My Department also funds a range of other programmes such as the Leader programme, the rural social scheme, Gaeltacht and island schemes that address rural depopulation in a general way through a number of supports. Information on these programmes is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>

Included in this figure is &euro;6.6 million expenditure under the rural social scheme which derives from dormant accounts funds. The spend from dormant accounts on the rural social scheme represents approximately 3% of total expenditure.</P>
        <P>For the avoidance of doubt, I would like to point out that the expenditure from dormant accounts on the rural social scheme is additional to the allocations approved by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board which are being channelled to successful applicants via Area Development Management Limited.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 222 and 226 together.</P>
        <P>Under harmonised rules the import into the EU of animal products for human consumption may only take place from countries and establishments approved by the community. For the protection of human and animal health exporting countries must have standards covering animal health, disease control arrangements and veterinary supervision of production and export establishments that are at least equivalent to standards required for the production in and trade between member states.</P>
        <P>Similar rules apply in respect of the approval of third countries for the export of live animals and for the export of animal by-products. There are also EU-wide controls prohibiting the importation of animal products from third countries by way of personal baggage and post.</P>
        <P>All consignments from third countries must be first landed at a border inspection post, BIP, approved by the EU and there undergo documentary, identity and physical veterinary checks in accordance with EU legislation. Consignments must be pre-notified to the BIP where it is intended to enter the EU and be accompanied by health certification in accordance with the models and requirements of EU legislation.</P>
        <P>Where there are concerns as to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country or, where the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously effect production and trade in animal products in the EU the Commission, in consultation with the standing committee on the food chain and animal health, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of animal and of human health.</P><Col N="1350"/>
        <P Just="Left">Since the outbreak of high pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in Asia, the EU has introduced a number of safeguard decisions banning trade in live poultry, live birds other than poultry, fresh poultry meat and untreated feathers from those third countries where an outbreak has been confirmed: Cambodia, Croatia, China, including the territory of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. The decisions apply controls on imports from each of these countries in accordance with its EU approval status to export animals and animal products. The EU standing committee on the food chain and animal health decided yesterday to ban the import of all captive live birds and the movements from third countries of live birds accompanying their owners into the Community.</P>
        <P>Poultry meat which has been cooked with a heat treatment of at least 70&deg; may continue to be imported from a third country that has been approved to export this product to the EU. This is the case for Thailand and Turkey.</P>

It is now a matter for the Land Registry Office to provide written confirmation to my Department that it has also carried out a search for this map. If it is unable to trace it then the Land Registry Office should request the survey branch of my Department to construct a duplicate map. In such circumstances this map re-construction would be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for consideration in respect of both <Col N="1352"/>the new entrant and inheritance measures of the single payment scheme. He was advised that he was ineligible to be treated as a new entrant during the 2000 to 2002 reference period as he farmed and received premia payments in respect of all three years. He was also not eligible to benefit from the transfer of entitlements by way of inheritance or gift as the lands in question were acquired by way of lease and purchase. A decision in respect of these applications was issued to the person named on 20 December 2004. The person named was advised to submit an application to have entitlements transferred to him by way of private contract clause when applying under the 2005 single payment scheme. The person named appealed these decisions to the single payment appeals committee which upheld this Department&rsquo;s decision and refused consideration in respect of both measures.</P>
        <P>The person named subsequently applied for consideration to have entitlements transferred to him by way of private contract clause. The person named advised that his application for the transfer of entitlements under this measure was successful and a letter notifying him of his successful application issued to him on 1 September 2005.</P>
        <P>The person named applied for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category A, which caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his-her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000-02. He also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements under category B, which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>The position is that applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received from over 17,500 farmers. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants by 1 December next. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed.</P>

This relationship includes formal meetings in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council as well as very regular, informal contact between officials in both Administrations.</P>
        <P>On the specific issue of the threat posed by avian influenza, my officials and their Northern counterparts are in very frequent contact and have discussed the issue at meetings on three separate occasions in recent weeks. In addition, both before and since this particular series of meetings began, ongoing informal contact has been and is continuing. The two Departments have been in contact as recently as this week considering their respective responses to the most recent developments. This level of informal contact will be maintained and, as necessary, the two Departments will meet to discuss their respective positions.</P><Col N="1354"/>
        <P>The officials of the two Departments have undertaken to maintain very close contact and co-operation on this issue which is of such mutual concern and, specifically, have agreed to exchange the results of their wild bird surveillance programmes, which are essential elements in terms of early detection of the disease.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>the way in which a person (details supplied) in County Wexford makes an application for Irish citizenship; and when this will be done; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[30781/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four ways in which a person born outside of Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship; by means of a grant as a token of honour, by descent, by naturalisation or by marriage to an Irish citizen, post-nuptial citizenship. It is assumed for the purposes of this reply that neither honorary citizenship nor citizenship by descent are relevant in the context of this question. Furthermore, due to the date of the person&rsquo;s marriage, he is not eligible to make a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship. I have, therefore, set out below some general information about the naturalisation process.</P>
        <P>The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish national, those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; be married to the Irish citizen for at least three years; be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting; be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>In other cases the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain more rigorous statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State <Col N="1355"/>immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>It appears from the information supplied by the Deputy that the earliest the person concerned can apply for naturalisation is October 2007. This is dependent on the person concerned having maintained his permission to remain in the State without any gaps since his arrival here in October 2002. He may also be eligible to apply for naturalisation in December 2007 on foot of his marriage. The administrative process is the same in both instances.</P>
        <P>Further information and the necessary application forms may be obtained from my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, or by telephoning the citizenship section helpline on Tuesdays or Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. at lo-call 1890 551 500 or 01 6167700.</P>

I can further inform the Deputy that while I have no plans for the introduction of a national identification card at this stage, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999, SI No. 4 of 1999, provides for a voluntary national age card scheme. Any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The regulations came into effect on 19 April 1999.</P>

This represents an increase of 40, or 30%, in the number of personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda station since that date.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the site in question is situated on open ground in the Kingswood area of Tallaght and that, because of its openness, it has been subject to occasional vandalism. I have been further advised that palisade fencing is currently being installed around the perimeter of the site and local Garda units will continue to patrol the area on a regular basis while this fencing is being installed. Local Garda management states that it is satisfied that adequate resources are currently available to police the site.</P>
        <P>As regards Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, both of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>

The board&rsquo;s services are available to persons of modest means and at little cost. Funding for the board has been increased by 16% since last year to &euro;21.362 million in 2005 and this additional funding has contributed to a significant improvement in waiting times across the country.

        <Quest>the way in which it is possible for a non-EU national to be residing in the same household as their Irish national spouse if his Department will not grant permission to the non-EU national spouse to live here with their spouse while their residency application is pending further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 530 of 30 June 2005 and 132 of 20 October 2005.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to reside in the State. However, if a non-EU national spouse of an Irish national was already legally resident in the State prior to the marriage then he or she can make a request to the local registration officer for a change of their status to reflect their marriage to that Irish national.</P>
        <P>In the event that a non-EU national has no legal status in the State at the time of the mar<Col N="1362"/>riage, other than as an asylum seeker or a visitor, and seeks permission to remain, such permission cannot be granted without first considering various aspects of the marriage. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. It is a fundamental requirement that a non-EU national seeking residency in the State on the sole basis of marriage to an Irish national resides in the same household and in a family unit with that Irish national. Consideration of such applications will involve the provision of documentary evidence to support the application and may also involve an interview by the immigration authorities of either or both parties. I do not propose to introduce any interim status for persons who are in the State pending the outcome of the deliberations into such applications.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department&rsquo;s primary concern in this matter is to maintain the integrity of the immigration system. There has been increasing experience of marriages being entered into for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration controls. Frequently in these circumstances, the Irish national may be totally unaware that this is the intention of the non-national and will feel aggrieved by the perception that the immigration authorities are interfering with their private affairs in refusing to allow their spouse to enter or to remain in the State. On occasion, the Irish national may be a willing party for their own personal benefit. Marriages of convenience for the purpose of circumventing normal immigration controls are experienced by immigration jurisdictions worldwide and, in this regard, holiday and Internet romances would feature frequently. In order to prevent abuses of the system, in so far as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish national&rsquo;s private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish and confirm various matters.</P>

	<P>The youth affairs section of my Department received an application for funding under the special projects for youth scheme on behalf of the group referred to by the Deputy. It was not possible to accede to this request this year due to the large number of applications received, over 70 in total. Application forms for the 2006 round of grants will issue shortly and every consideration will be given to a renewed application <Col N="1363"/>from the group having regard to the overall financial provision for the youth sector next year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 &mdash; projected &mdash; in 2004-05.</P>
        <P>Over 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In <Col N="1370"/>allocating teaching posts, regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.</P>
        <P>In relation to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The staffing of the first school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal, 12 mainstream class teachers, two permanent learning support or resource teachers and one temporary learning support or resource teacher. Based on an enrolment of 348 pupils on 30 September 2005 and 12 mainstream class teachers, the average class size is 29:1. The staffing of the second school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal, 15 mainstream class teachers, and two permanent learning support or resource teachers. Based on an enrolment of 420 pupils on 30 September 2005 and 15 mainstream class teachers, the average class size is 28:1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The staffing of the third school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal, 14 mainstream class teachers, one permanent learning support or resource teacher, one permanent resource teacher and two shared temporary learning support or resource teachers. Based on an enrolment of 381 pupils on 30 September 2005 and 14 mainstream class teachers, the average class size is 27.2:1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The staffing of the fourth school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year is a principal, 14 mainstream class teachers, two permanent learning support or resource teachers, and two shared temporary learning support or resource teachers. Based on an enrolment of 377 pupils on 30 September 2005 and 14 mainstream class teachers, the average class size is 26.9:1.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior <Col N="1371"/>classes. The issue of class size in the four schools referred to by the Deputy will be addressed in this context.</P>

	<P>The provision and improvement of non-national roads in County Kerry is a matter for Kerry County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants.</P>
        <P>In August this year, my Department sought applications from road authorities for funding under the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme. The initial selection of projects to be submitted for consideration for funding under this scheme is a matter for road authorities. It is, accordingly, a matter for Kerry County Council to decide whether it wishes to submit an application for improvements to the Dale Road for consideration for funding in 2006 under this scheme.</P>
        <P>Local authorities may also use their discretionary improvement grant allocations from my Department to fund eligible road improvement schemes. In 2005, the total discretionary improvement grant allocation to Kerry County Council is &euro;1,075,000. The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is a matter for the council.</P>

	<P>The detailed information sought is not available in my Department. National waste statistics for all waste streams are published at three-yearly intervals by the Environmental Protection Agency with the most recent national waste database report being in respect of 2001. In the intervening period, two further interim reports have been published to provide data on municipal waste specifically, that is, household and commercial waste, for the years 2002 and 2003, respectively. While the database reports do not provide recycling rates for individual local authorities, an overall recycling figure for Ireland is provided for in respect of a number of waste streams.</P>
        <P>The latest figures available on municipal waste generation, recovery and disposal are contained in the national waste database interim report for 2003, published by the agency in December 2004, which reports that the recycling rate in the municipal waste stream has advanced to 28.4% in 2003, up from 20.7% in 2002. I understand that the agency is currently compiling its database for 2004 which will be finalised by end 2005.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have detailed information on the number of bedsit units in the local authority housing stock. However, the number of such units is likely to be very small as local authorities have not constructed bedsit accommodation for many years. My Department&rsquo;s current social housing design guidelines indicate that local authorities should provide dwellings with separate bedroom-bedrooms and living areas in all instances.</P>
        <P>Neither does my Department have detailed information on the number of bedsits in the private rented sector. Tenancy registration is the statutory responsibility of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the PRTB, an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act. The PRTB has published extracts from its register of tenancies, including a description of the dwelling type, which is available for viewing at its offices at Canal House, Canal Road, Ranelagh, Dublin 6 or on its website.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 prescribe minimum standards applying to rented residential accommodation in both the public and private sectors. The provision of bedsit accommodation is specifically dealt with by the regulations which prescribe minimum requirements regarding toilet and bath-shower facilities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 to 281, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing came into effect on 13 April 2005. They provide that reasonable proposals on suitable sites in rural areas for persons who are part of, contribute to or have links with the rural community must be accommodated. The <Col N="1378"/>guidelines thus affirm a presumption in favour of quality one-off housing for rural communities, provided proposals meet normal standards concerning matters such as proper waste water disposal and road safety. Following the publication of the guidelines, planning authorities were asked to review their development plans with a view to incorporating changes necessary to ensure that development plan policies are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines.</P>
        <P>My Department held two seminars in June for local authority planning officials on the implementation of the guidelines. The seminars dealt with the overall objectives of the guidelines and provided practical advice on the implementation of their core provisions, including preparation of development plan policies, providing better support and advice to applicants, as well as a more efficient and comprehensive consideration of planning applications.</P>
        <P>In September 2005, my Department also held discussions on the guidelines with the planning committee of the County and City Managers Association. These discussions were around the need to embed regard for the guidelines, as required by section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, in the performance by local authorities of their relevant functions, that is, in making or reviewing their development plans, in providing planning services to applicants or potential applicants and in deciding on planning applications. County managers have also been asked for a report on the measures taken to date to implement the guidelines and their impact. The indications from reports received to date are that planning authorities have already considered or are considering any necessary changes to their development plans in order to give full effect to the guidelines. I intend to continue closely monitoring the effectiveness of the guidelines.</P>
        <P>On the publication recently of its annual report for 2004, An Bord Plean&aacute;la stated that it had regard to the draft planning guidelines on sustainable rural housing which were issued in March 2004 in deciding appeals with regard to one-off houses in rural areas. In line with the guidelines, the board stated that it takes a positive attitude, subject to compliance with site specific good planning principles, to locally based rural generated housing needs. A survey of appeals relating to one-off rural housing developments decided from March to December 2004 and to which the guidelines were relevant is contained in appendix 6 of the annual report, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. In 2004, 17% of appeals against refusal by the planning authority of planning permission for one-off rural houses were granted by the board, compared with 4% in 2003. The board is required to have regard to the finalised guidelines when deciding on <Col N="1379"/>appeals made since the guidelines came into effect last April.</P>

        <P>The latest figures collated by my Department show that 64 local authority civic amenity sites were in operation throughout the country at the end of 2004 and a further five have opened to date during 2005. Some 34 of these civic amenity sites have been part funded through the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme, which is designed to assist local authorities in the provision of recycling and recovery infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Funding has been committed to another 14 facilities which are being developed at present. Some are at a more advanced stage than others. A further 40 projects are under consideration by the Department, some of which are still at a very preliminary stage. I expect to announce a new round of grants in the very near future.</P>

These proposals are at an advanced stage of consideration and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement regarding the successful projects shortly.</P>

	<P>Prior to the local authority playground grants scheme 2004, my Department did not operate a specific scheme of grants for playground projects. The 2004 scheme provided up to 50% funding for the development of new or renovation of existing playgrounds throughout the country. While the scheme was administered by the National Children&rsquo;s Office, the grants were paid out from my Department&rsquo;s Vote. More than &euro;2 million was allocated to county and city councils in respect of 32 new or refurbished playground projects.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year I announced funding of a further &euro;2 million for local authorities for the development of playground facilities. In this regard, a fixed grant of &euro;60,000 has been allocated to each county and city council to meet the cost of purchase and delivery of playground equipment. Installation and all other costs, including ongoing maintenance, are to be funded from local sources.</P>

	<P>The Kinvara sewerage scheme is included in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme for 2004 to 2006 as a scheme to start construction in 2006. Galway County Council&rsquo;s revised preliminary report for the scheme, which was submitted to my Department earlier this month, is under examination and is being dealt with as quickly as possible. Once the preliminary report has been approved, the council will be in a position to prepare contract documents.</P>
