    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the action of the Kerry Group in terminating the contracts of 12 small milk hauliers, which will have a severe impact on their livelihoods, on which the immediate intervention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food is vital to ensure proper traceability from the producer through the food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the dissolution next week of the Dunne inquiry into the retention of organs of children taken without the consent of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the winding up the Dunne inquiry, which cost the taxpayer more than &euro;20 million, without completing its work; the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to explain why the Department continued with this inquiry, despite the constant objections of the parents who pointed out that the inquiry could not be properly conducted under its terms of reference; and the need to accede to the reasonable request of the Parents for Justice group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 9<i>a</i>, motion re establishment of Joint Committee on the Constitution; No. 19, R&aacute;itis maidir leis an nGaeilge &mdash; Statements on <Col N="1914"/>the Irish Language, to conclude at 12 noon, if not previously concluded; No. 9<i>b</i>, motion re Zimbabwe and Roy Bennett; No. 18, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 22, Land Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, or the Order of the D&aacute;il of 23 March 2005, that (1) No. 9<i>a</i> shall be taken immediately after the Order of Business and shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 9<i>b</i> shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after one hour and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and (ii) subject to (i) Members may share time; and (3) the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 April 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9<i>a</i> agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9<i>b</i> agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the adjournment of the D&aacute;il agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not prepared to agree to the adjournment of the House unless there is an emergency debate, or at least a statement by the Minister for Health and Children, to address the latest crisis in the health service relating to the Dunne inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with the adjournment of the D&aacute;il be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the Taoiseach is not present on the break up of the House for a further two weeks, as a number of serious issues need to be addressed. Is the Bill recently passed capable of dealing with the regulation of the spending of public money, given that it has come to light that a farm four miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who described the Abbotstown proposal as a Ceaucescu-like development, has spent &euro;30 million of the taxpayer&rsquo;s money on a 150-acre farm to build a prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other ways the Deputy can raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Another farm comprising 243 acres, four miles away, was sold yesterday for just over &euro;6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are the prudent Progressive Democrats?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1915"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order. There are many ways the Deputy can raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not send him to buy a bag of bull&rsquo;s-eyes, never mind a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is another example of profligate spending from the public purse. Will the new development be the McDowell monument to political spending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a second issue, which is the M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin special, the Dunne inquiry. I listened to an articulate argument on a national radio programme about this earlier. The previous Minister for Health and Children stated in writing that if the Dunne inquiry failed to bring a satisfactory conclusion to this matter, which is of serious concern to a large number of people, there would be a sworn public inquiry. When will the Government outline its proposals to deal with the consequence of closing the Dunne inquiry, in respect of which significant public money has been expended without arriving at a conclusion? Will the Government&rsquo;s response be a sworn public inquiry, as stated in writing by the previous Minister?</P>
      <P>While people will welcome the issuing of a temporary visa to a Nigerian student who was deported, one is drawn to the conclusion &mdash; perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will comment on this &mdash; that the orders signed by him in this case were not read by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. That matter was discussed at length in the House this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On a humanitarian issue, the Minister can suddenly reverse an independent decision. Did he read the report on the order that was signed in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Dunne inquiry, I call Deputy Gormley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would like to reply. The whole country is talking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>He is speechless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be allowed reply on the Dunne inquiry, but we will hear Deputy Gormley on the same issue.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1916"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Finance agree that the Dunne inquiry is yet another debacle involving the Department of Health and Children? Deadline after deadline was missed and despite the continuous representations by the Parents for Justice Group, which stated that it could not complete its work under the terms of reference, the Department continued with its stance. Will the Minister explain to the House why &euro;20 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money was spent on what has turned out to be an incomplete inquiry? Will he agree it has added to the suffering of the parents? What will the Government do now? Will it accede to the reasonable request of the parents and set up this statutory inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Rabbitte on the same issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Sir, I would like to hear the Minister. The omnibus reply is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, I will hear you on this issue if you wish to contribute and then I will call the Minister, but we are not having a debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The country is having a debate on it. Why can we not have one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business. It is not Question Time or Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Sir, I would like to hear the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not opening a debate on the issue. When I hear the Minister, that will be the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not open my mouth about anything, Sir. Why are you so protective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>When I hear the Minister it will conclude the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are you so protective, Sir?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of being protective of anybody, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>You are interfering and I did not say anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have an orderly Order of Business. We will not have Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>You got your retaliation in first, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard from the Opposition about the importance of value for money for the taxpayer. Regarding the Dunne inquiry, the total cost of the inquiry was approximately <Col N="1917"/>&euro;20 million up to the end of December 2004. On 1 September last the Government decided that the chair of the inquiry should furnish to the Minister for Health and Children, not later than 31 March, a final report following which the inquiry would cease to exist. The T&aacute;naiste expects to get a comprehensive report on paediatric hospitals and certain other matters on or before 31 March. The content of the report will inform the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s decision on how to proceed beyond that date. I understand she met the Parents for Justice group yesterday and indicated that she will revert to it as soon as the contents of the report are known. We will take our legal advice from the Attorney General in the normal way and the Minister will then revert to the group concerned as to how we proceed.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the purpose of Government is to establish the facts. The important point is how we establish the facts surrounding these matters. That does not involve any particular route or inquiry. It is a matter of establishing the facts. An inquiry in Northern Ireland with a similar remit and terms of reference to the current one concluded its work in 15 to 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask the Minister for Finance if it is the intention of the Government to revert to the original promise to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, that does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What does not arise, Sir?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to raise the matter on the Adjournment, he will have an opportunity to do so but he&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What does not arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on it on the Order of Business. The Order of Business is quite specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is promised legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy was given an opportunity to put his question. We cannot go on all day with a debate on this issue. There is other business arranged for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I do not intend to refer to the Dunne shambles. Will the Minister for Finance indicate whether it is the intention of the Government to revert to the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce 200,000 additional medical cards, having regard to the developments of today when the T&aacute;naiste came up with the bright idea for 200,000 yellow pack cards on the basis that no legislation was required and that she had the support of the IMO? She then found out that she had to legislate.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1918"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, that does not arise on the Order of Business, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>She has legislated and the cards are no longer in prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, that does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a shambles that she can blame on her predecessor. It is due to her lack of preparation and lack of work on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte, you are out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste may wish she was back in the bosom of IDA Ireland, but there are many people who cannot visit the family doctor because of the current pressure. The Minister can implement the Government decision to provide 200,000 medical cards as committed to in the programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What has the Minister for Finance to say about it? A Cheann Comhairle, this is entirely unreasonable. The Minister for Finance wants to reply and I respectfully submit, Sir, that you ought to permit him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a general omnibus question time on the Order of Business, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to prevent the Minister from answering, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s permission and respecting his ruling on this matter, the new medical cards are intended to allow 200,000 more people visit their GP free of charge. We do not accept that this is a material change in the GMS contract. We have always accepted that details regarding operational matters would be agreed with the IMO. The legislation was enacted this month. The Government has put everything in place. The IMO could help by sitting down with the Health Service Executive and the Department and agreeing the small operational details that are involved. I understand the only difference from a doctor&rsquo;s point of view is that they will be signing a different form. In every other respect it is the same procedure regarding their existing arrangements. There is no extra workload involved. The Government has made the decision, as we are entitled to do, to provide for an additional 200,000 doctor only medical cards for these people and it is incumbent on everyone to sit down and ensure the operational details are put in place immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>People on very low incomes cannot visit their family doctor at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte, I ask you to resume your seat and allow Deputy Sargent to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte should remind the IMO of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government ought to restore&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte, I ask you to resume your seat. I call Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should remind the IMO of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like clarification of the Government&rsquo;s promise on the date for a referendum on the EU constitution. In today&rsquo;s newspapers the Government announced the launch of a new website and there is reference to a referendum in autumn of next year. Is there clarity on the Government side as to when the referendum will be held? On promised legislation, and to tie in with that, will the defence amendment Bill be given any greater priority having regard to the fact that it is to amend the Defence Act 1954, with the EU battle groups in mind? Will the Minister give us an indication of dates for the referendum and that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to say at this stage when the defence amendment Bill will be ready. I understand the heads of a Bill will be prepared during the course of this year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the referendum on the EU constitution, work is continuing on that at Cabinet sub-committee level. I understand it is the intention, if it has not already begun, to start a consultation process with other party leaders in the House on developing a consensus on the wording so that we can bring this matter to the people, with the full support of this House, with a view to its being successfully enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government waiting for the French result before it makes a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I read during the week that changes have been agreed in the Stability and Growth Pact which will have an impact on our financial budgeting. Why was an Irish Minister not in attendance at the meeting at which these changes were agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It does because if these changes raise interest rates by even half a point, it will cost Irish householders &euro;500 million. We must have <Col N="1920"/>scrutiny of what is agreed on our behalf, even if Ministers do not bother to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. Does the Deputy want to ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will this be brought before the House for discussion? Will it be brought before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service? When will there be a discussion of what has been agreed in the Minister&rsquo;s absence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a debate promised in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>If they wish to do so, the Whips can organise a debate on the decisions which were taken. I attended all the meetings other than the one last Sunday which took place while I was returning from the United States. We had no outstanding issues. Our officials were quite capable of dealing with the matter. No issue arose for us in the course of the last meeting. To suggest that we were not represented is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Central Bank immediately indicated that the decision could lead to a rise in interest rates which would have a significant impact on Irish housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the ECB&rsquo;s statement on the matter. The purpose of the discussion on the changes in the Stability and Growth Pact was to ensure its wider acceptability and greater credibility. We have considered the experience of the past seven years to ensure that rules are not applied rigidly and automatically without taking into account certain relevant factors which are beneficial to us. I would have expected the Fine Gael finance spokesman to be broadly supportive of this approach given that every time he comes to the House he asks for more money to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should examine the fudge in the texts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Another case of abuse of a migrant worker in this country has come to light today, this time in my constituency. It is virtually a daily occurrence. Will the Minister ensure that the employment permits Bill is brought to the House quickly so that we can ensure that the level of adherence to the terms and conditions which apply to the bringing of people to work in this country in good faith is monitored properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. We hope to publish the Bill before the start of the next D&aacute;il session.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1921"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s U-turn in the case of a young Nigerian student who will now be allowed to return to Ireland. The Minister had said in the D&aacute;il that the floodgates would open if he were to make such a decision.</P>

T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo an-t&aacute;bhachtach agus b&rsquo;fhi&uacute; d&uacute;inn go l&eacute;ir &eacute;isteacht leis na daoine at&aacute; ag obair ar son na Gaeilge.

T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; maithe ar si&uacute;il sna scoileanna sin agus caithfimid foghlaim &oacute; na daoine sin.</P>
      <P>As a person not fluent in Irish, I wish to contribute to the development of this debate. It is essential to begin with the process of the teaching of the language in primary and second level schools. This has been a major issue for the <Col N="1933"/>last 20 or 30 years. The success stories of families, particularly those in Gaeltacht areas, and those involved in Gaelscoileanna have shown us the progressive way forward in regard to the language. Language must be taught with the support of the community and parents. Teaching the language in isolation in schools simply does not work.</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge an element of hostility in society to the Irish language and culture. There is an opportunity for all-party support to deal with this hostility, particularly that emanating from political elements and the media. We have a duty as public representatives to show leadership on this issue and to challenge those who claim the language should not be taught in primary schools and that TG4 should be terminated. We are concerned these days with respect for different languages and cultures in our society. This is an opportunity to put such sentiments into practice.</P>
      <P>The children of this nation have given us great examples of respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. Many primary schools, especially Gaelscoileanna, have given us a lead in regard to education and the removal of barriers. I am aware of several Gaelscoileanna which accommodate pupils of different nationalities. These children have no difficulty in coping with several different languages and cultures. Those concerned with the promotion of the Irish language have been to the fore on this issue because they see respect for culture and language as an important ethos in modern society.</P>
      <P>However, an important issue is the existence of a rump within the Irish language movement which does not seem to be sufficiently open to dealing with those who may not have confidence in their ability to learn or speak the language. This latter may be a consequence of childhood experiences when there was a strong emphasis on the importance of correct grammar. Many people, including myself, have a positive attitude to Irish but are not fluent in the language. We have a duty, particularly those with the talent and gift of fluency in the language, to encourage and motivate such people in gaining confidence to be part of the movement to develop the language.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, some may be discouraged by their encounters with a sector of those involved in the promotion of the language. In every society there are those who send out a negative message. On the other hand, there are many in the Irish language movement who make a positive contribution. The Minister is acquainted with a friend of mine, Mr. Liam &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in, who is involved in Oideas Gael. Such people have dedicated much time to the language, formulated many credible policies and devised excellent projects to develop the language in their own communities.</P>
      <?oasys _xh?>
      <P>These are issues from which we should not shy away in considering the development of the Irish language. T&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht faoi leith ag baint leis an teanga i dtaobh chult&uacute;r agus thraidisi&uacute;n na t&iacute;re, <Col N="1934"/>ach is g&aacute; bheith r&eacute;ala&iacute;och faoi na athruithe ollmh&oacute;ra at&aacute; tar &eacute;is teacht chun cinn le deich mbliana anuas.

Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, t&aacute; f&aacute;s agus forbairt dochreidte tagtha ar scola&iacute;ocht agus oideachas &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge, de rud a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn go bhfuil an teanga ag f&aacute;s agus ag forbairt mar theanga l&eacute;inn seachas teanga cumars&aacute;ide.</P>
      <P>Dar liom, t&aacute; freagra na ceiste i leith na teanga &aacute;it &eacute;igin idir an d&aacute; st&oacute;l. Is duine dearfach m&eacute; agus feictear go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&uacute;il ag daoine &oacute;ga i gceist na teanga n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; riamh. Feicim &eacute; seo sa tsl&iacute; go mb&iacute;onn an cult&uacute;r &aacute; chur chun cinn ar fud an domhain. T&aacute; br&oacute;d agus meas ag daoine &oacute;ga ar an gcult&uacute;r at&aacute; acu ach is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn an cult&uacute;r agus an traidisi&uacute;n a leathn&uacute; agus a fhorbairt os comhair p&aacute;ist&iacute; agus daoine eile nach raibh an deis riamh acu an teanga n&oacute; n&oacute;smhaireacht chult&uacute;rtha na t&iacute;re seo a bhlaiseadh.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; seanfhocal ann a deireann, &ldquo;T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam&rdquo;, agus aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an r&aacute;iteas &uacute;d mar is tr&iacute;d an teanga ar f&eacute;idir leis an duine aithne cheart a chur ar a oidhreacht f&eacute;in. T&aacute; s&eacute; suas don Rialtas seo d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go gcuid&iacute;onn Aontas na hEorpa linn an teanga a chaomhn&uacute; agus a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar aghaidh san aon&uacute; haois is fiche. T&aacute;imse d&oacute;chasach sa ghl&uacute;in at&aacute; le teacht agus, c&eacute; go bhfuil fadhbanna agus tuairim&iacute;ocht l&aacute;idir i gcoinne na teanga, n&iacute; m&oacute;r do Ghaeilgeor&iacute; na t&iacute;re an f&oacute;d a sheasamh agus lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh ag tabhairt inspreagtha agus deiseanna labhartha do muintir na h&Eacute;ireann sa ghl&uacute;in at&aacute; ag teacht.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; c&uacute;pla molta&iacute; agam. Ba ch&oacute;ir c&oacute;ras nua a chur i bhfeidhm i leith mh&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge i mbunscoileanna mar is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil laige agus easpa dul chun cinn ann maidir leis an teanga labhartha. Bheadh s&eacute; mar ch&uacute;ram ag m&uacute;inteoir amh&aacute;in n&oacute; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; an teanga a mh&uacute;ineadh amanta faoi leith do gach rang sa scoil. I me&aacute;nscoileanna ba cheart b&eacute;im n&iacute;os m&oacute; a chur ar an dteanga labhartha &oacute; thaobh scr&uacute;duithe de agus ba cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir go gcaithfeadh gach uile dalta tr&eacute;imhse amh&aacute;in sa Gaeltacht idir an ch&eacute;ad bhliain agus &eacute; n&oacute; &iacute; an scoil &aacute; fh&aacute;g&aacute;il sa s&eacute;&uacute; bliain.</P>
      <?oasys _ah?>
      <P>These are the types of issues that I would like to raise in the debate. Many progressive people are involved and interested in the Irish language. I pay tribute to the broadcasting station, TG4, which has made a considerable contribution to a positive image of the Irish language. I say this in all sincerity as I have spoken to many people who have commented that when it comes to presentation as regards Nuacht and other programmes, TG4 can match other television stations at an international level. I commend the TG4 staff on the excellent work and on the station&rsquo;s performance over a number of years.</P><Col N="1935"/>
      <P>Again, I take issue with those in the broader society who challenge the wisdom of spending money on our language and culture. They emerge now and again to attack stations such as TG4 and question the use of public money in this regard. We should make no apologies for supporting our language and culture.</P>
      <P>I welcome recent developments in the peace process and the talks on Northern Ireland. One of the happiest occasions I have witnessed, in Glencolumbkille, County Donegal, was to see members of the Unionist tradition coming there to learn Irish, to get involved in the culture and celebrate the language. That has been happening in recent years. It is part of the larger picture in terms of the peace process when one sees people from a different tradition and culture interested in learning about our culture and language, taking into account mutual respect for difference. It is not about taking over a people&rsquo;s language and identity but rather working and living together on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Among the progressive forces in Irish society leading the charge on these issues are the people in the Irish language movement. Also among the progressive forces, and we should make no apology for this, are people who constantly campaign for Irish independence and unity who are directly involved in the language movement, and I commend them. This is part of our history going back generations. It should be passed on to our children and to future generations because there is a major problem with a sector of society. In the context of by-elections, for example, it is not democratically acceptable that up to 60% of the electorate do not bother to vote. There is something wrong and this must be addressed. There is a cultural problem and a democratic problem and they are interlinked and intertwined.</P>
      <P>Those are a few short comments on the Irish language movement and the debate on Irish. It is appropriate that there are a number of cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais in the D&aacute;il as well as a number of people with a few words of Irish, together with Deputies who have a positive attitude towards the language but might not necessarily have the confidence to use it. As part of this debate I ask the Minister to listen to all the different strands. He should listen to us and open his mind and heart. A positive majority of people is genuinely interested in the language and all they require is encouragement.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom, i dtosach b&aacute;ire, bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; ar fad a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.</P>
      <P>B&iacute;onn rud amh&aacute;in ag cur isteach orm beag&aacute;in&iacute;n. Am ar bith a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilgeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, b&iacute;onn siad beag&aacute;in&iacute;n amhrasach go praitici&uacute;il an bhfuileadar ag br&uacute; Gaeilge ar dhaoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r sa Teach seo, smaoin&iacute;onn daoine, le go dtuigf&iacute; iad, go gcaithfidh siad B&eacute;arla a labhairt. In aon pharlaimint eile ar domhan a bhfuil c&oacute;ras <Col N="1936"/>comhuaineach inti, n&iacute; ghlacfar lena leith&eacute;id sin de chaint. T&aacute; an c&oacute;ras sin ann le go dtuigfidh daoine iad. I bParlaimint na hEorpa, m&aacute; labhra&iacute;onn duine Fraincis &mdash; n&iacute;l aon Fhraincis agam ar fi&uacute; caint uirthi &mdash; n&iacute;l aon dul as agam ach na cluas&aacute;in a chur orm, agus t&aacute; an teanga ann.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; an chos&uacute;lacht ar an sc&eacute;al i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go mb&iacute;onn daoine ag samhl&uacute; go bhfuil daoine ag br&uacute; Gaeilge ar dhaoine. Is &eacute; a mhalairt at&aacute; f&iacute;or, ar ch&uacute;ins&iacute; praitici&uacute;la. M&aacute; t&aacute; comhluadar ann agus B&eacute;arl&oacute;ir amh&aacute;in ina measc, is &eacute; an n&oacute;s at&aacute; ann n&aacute; go n-iompa&iacute;onn chuile dhuine ar an mB&eacute;arla. N&iacute;l m&eacute;&aacute; r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; sin m&iacute;cheart, ach sin an n&oacute;s at&aacute; ann, agus n&iacute;l &eacute;inne ann, ar an eolas agamsa, a ghearrann daoine amach mar nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Is finsc&eacute;al &eacute; go bhfuil l&iacute;on m&oacute;r Gaeilgeoir&iacute; ag br&uacute; Gaeilge anuas ar dhaoine agus nach bhfuil siad s&aacute;sta labhairt i mB&eacute;arla le daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu.</P>
      <P>Is &eacute; an dara rud n&aacute;&eacute; seo. Le 50 bliain, m&aacute; bh&iacute;&oacute; na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; aon seirbh&iacute;s a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, chaithfid&iacute;s dul a throid ar a son. Ceann de na haidhmeanna a bh&iacute; ag an Acht teanga n&aacute; go mbeadh a gcearta ar f&aacute;il ag Gaeilgeoir&iacute;. B&iacute;mid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag caint ar cheartas sa Teach seo. Ba cheart go mbeadh a gcearta ar f&aacute;il ag Gaeilgeoir&iacute; gan dul chun dl&iacute; chun iad a &eacute;ileamh. Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, bheadh na cearta sin soil&eacute;ir. N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le daoine ruda&iacute; m&iacute;r&eacute;ala&iacute;ocha a &eacute;ileamh. Sa gcomhth&eacute;acs sin, creidim f&eacute;in go bhfuil an tAcht teanga me&aacute;ite.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; daoine ag casaoid, tugaim faoi deara. Is &eacute; an chasaoid is m&oacute; a chloisim faoin Acht teanga n&aacute; go bhfoils&iacute;tear ruda&iacute; i nGaeilge agus nach l&eacute;ann daoine iad. N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or, ar dh&aacute; ch&uacute;is. Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, is ioma&iacute; an rud a fhoils&iacute;tear i mB&eacute;arla sa t&iacute;r seo. Faighim barra l&aacute;n de stuif a thagann isteach san oifig in aghaidh na seachtaine, agus n&iacute;l a fhios agam an l&eacute;ann &eacute;inne leath den stuif a fhaighim i mB&eacute;arla. T&aacute; 90% de i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in. N&iacute;l &eacute;inne buartha faoin gcostas a bhaineann le heagarth&oacute;ireacht, r&eacute;iteach agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>N&iacute; ach 600 doicim&eacute;ad sa mbliain &eacute; as na m&iacute;lte doicim&eacute;ad ar fad a chuirtear ar f&aacute;il a chaithfear a chur ar f&aacute;il go d&aacute;theangach. Go tobann, t&aacute; ceist mh&oacute;r faoin gcostas agus fadhb ann. N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go l&eacute;ann &eacute;inne na doicim&eacute;id seo &oacute; th&uacute;s go deireadh i nGaeilge n&oacute; i mB&eacute;arla, i bhFraincis n&oacute; in Hiond&uacute;is. N&iacute; l&eacute;ifid&iacute;s ach oiread iad, ach sin an c&oacute;ras ina mairimid &mdash; go gcuirtear an t-uaf&aacute;s ruda&iacute; ar ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ar. T&aacute; a fhios agam f&eacute;in go bhfuil m&eacute; tinn tuirseach ag f&aacute;il tuarasc&aacute;lacha at&aacute; chomh tiubh sin. Fi&uacute; d&aacute; mbeadh an t-am ar fad &oacute; cheann go ceann na bliana agam, n&iacute;orbh fh&eacute;idir liom iad a l&eacute;amh, ach sin mar at&aacute; an saol. Rud amh&aacute;in a thiocfaidh as seo n&aacute; go ngearrfaidh chuile dhuine na tuarasc&aacute;lacha seo s&iacute;os go dt&iacute; na ruda&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha.</P>
      <P>Ar aon chaoi, go hiond&uacute;il, craobhscaoiltear na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; ar thuarasc&aacute;lacha tr&iacute;d na me&aacute;in. Sin an chaoi a nd&eacute;antar craobhscaoileadh ar ruda&iacute;. T&aacute; an ceart c&eacute;anna ag me&aacute;in na Gaeilge leagan oifigi&uacute;il Gaeilge de na tuarasc&aacute;lacha seo a bheith acu go d&iacute;reach mar a bh&iacute;onn siad ag na me&aacute;in <Col N="1937"/>Bh&eacute;arla. T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte gur &aacute;is iontach &eacute; d&aacute; leith&eacute;id de TG4, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus Raidi&oacute; na Life go bhfuil na c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; seo ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge agus ar an l&aacute; a fhoils&iacute;tear iad. T&aacute; an bunleagan acu gur f&eacute;idir leo si&uacute;d a dtuairisc a dh&eacute;anamh i measc an phobail.</P>
      <P>N&iacute; chreidim go bhfaighidh an Ghaeilge b&aacute;s. T&aacute; d&oacute;thain daoine a labhrann Gaeilge lena gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; de rogha agus roghn&oacute;idh siadsan Gaeilge a labhairt lena gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; f&eacute;in. M&aacute; leanfaidh daoine &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sin, n&iacute;l aon bhaol don Ghaeilge b&aacute;s a fh&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>Bh&iacute; b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir 500 duine ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; i gCnoc na Cathrach nuair a rinne Gaeltacht de i 1956. T&aacute; 14,000 sa cheantar sin anois agus t&aacute; chuile sheans go bhfuil f&oacute;s 500 Gaeilgeoir ann. T&aacute; Gaelscoil ansin agus t&aacute; daoine i mo Roinn f&eacute;in a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge achan l&aacute;i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ann. Sin an fhadhb leis an Ghaeltacht, n&iacute;l s&iacute; chomh simpl&iacute; sin. N&iacute; dh&eacute;arna an t-iarAire, an Teachta Michael Higgins, tada faoin gceist seo. T&aacute; s&eacute; m&iacute;nithe agam go soil&eacute;ir ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile c&eacute;n chaoi a bhfuil m&eacute; ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le moladh Choimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta le ceist teorainneacha na Gaeltachta ach n&iacute; ceist shimpl&iacute; &eacute;.</P>
      <P>I 1955, rinneadh anail&iacute;s ar dhaonra labhartha Gaeilge na Gaeltachta. Oibr&iacute;odh amach ag an am sin go raibh thart ar 35,000 cainteoir d&uacute;chasach Gaeilge sa nGaeltacht. An rud aisteach n&aacute; m&aacute; fh&eacute;achaimid ag na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; ann anois, n&iacute;l athr&uacute; air sin. T&aacute; an Ghaeltacht n&iacute;os l&iacute;onmhaire agus t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ann anois. T&aacute; siad n&iacute;os measctha, agus n&iacute;l an seanphobal gan B&eacute;arla ann. I mbealach, is rud iontach go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht chomh l&aacute;idir sin, ag glacadh leis an bhr&uacute; at&aacute; uirthi.</P>
      <P>Aonta&iacute;m leis an Teachta Gilmore faoi rud amh&aacute;in. N&iacute;l m&eacute; ar chomhaigne leis faoin nGaeltacht i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath ach tagaim leis faoin CyberGaeltacht. T&aacute; gr&eacute;as&aacute;in Ghaeltachta ann le Gaeilgeoir&iacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re at&aacute; i gcaidreamh lena ch&eacute;ile agus a bhreathna&iacute;onn ar TG4. N&iacute;l s&eacute; i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath amh&aacute;in &mdash; t&aacute; s&eacute; ar fud na tire. Is iontach an rud &eacute; agus molaim an Teachta Michael Higgins agus an t-iarTheachta Geoghan-Quinn, a chuir t&uacute;s le TG4. Is minic a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; gur sin ceann de na ruda&iacute; is fearr a tharla &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de agus n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ariamh taobh thiar den doras ag moladh na ndaoine a rinne sin.</P>
      <P>N&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go gcaithfidh Foras na Gaeilge a bheith ina eisceacht nuair a bheidh d&iacute;lar&uacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh. D&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go raibh cinneadh ceann&aacute;ras Fhoras na Gaeilge a chur &oacute; thuaidh go T&iacute;r Chonaill gan aon d&iacute;lar&uacute; eile ar bun sa t&iacute;r, thuigfinn ansin go mbeadh meon ann go gcaithf&iacute; chuile rud a chur siar mar go mbaineann s&eacute; leis an Ghaeilge. Nuair a bh&iacute;onn polasa&iacute; l&aacute;idir d&iacute;l&aacute;raithe ag an Rialtas ar fad, agus Ranna St&aacute;it de chuile cine&aacute;l curtha ar fud na t&iacute;re, n&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go gcaithfidh eisceacht a dh&eacute;anamh d&rsquo;Fhoras na Gaeilge. Is meon sin go gcaithfidh gach rud sa t&iacute;r seo bheith l&aacute;raithe i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.

T&aacute; an d&aacute; thuairim ann. Cuireann Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta leaganacha Gaeilge ar na peilead&oacute;ir&iacute; ar fad at&aacute; ag imirt. T&eacute;ann TG4 de r&eacute;ir ainm an duine sin mar is eol &eacute; go coitianta.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to move this motion regarding the case of Mr. Roy Bennett, the Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, Member of Parliament in the Zimbabwean Parliament. It is important that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should have the opportunity to discuss and convey its concerns regarding this serious ill-treatment of a fellow parliamentarian in a country with which Ireland has strong links.</P>
      <P>Both the German and Swedish Parliaments have conveyed their concerns via their respective speakers to the Zimbabwean authorities regarding the treatment of Mr. Bennett, while the European Parliament has also commented critically on Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s treatment in a resolution adopted last December. The Government has closely followed Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case and shares many of the concerns expressed regarding the manner in which Mr. Bennett has been treated and the handling of the matter by the Zimbabwean Parliament.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that certain of the procedures employed in the establishment of the committee of privileges of the Zimbabwean Parliament, which heard Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case and which subsequently sentenced him to 12 months' imprisonment with labour, are open to question. From a review of the events following the incident in the Zimbabwean Parliament on 18 May 2004, during which Mr. Bennett shoved the Zimbabwean Minister for Justice to the floor, it is difficult to conclude in any objective way that Mr. Bennett received a fair hearing. It is also clear that Mr. Bennett was subjected to considerable provocation immediately prior to the incident, which resulted in his imprisonment.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to condone those actions that resulted in Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s imprisonment, it is clear that the sentence imposed was politically motivated and wholly disproportionate to the offence committed. There is no precedent for the Zimbabwean Parliament having sentenced one of its members to imprisonment in this way, even though similar events have occurred in that legislature in the past. The severity of the sentence is unprecedented internationally.</P>
      <P>At my request, our embassy in South Africa, which is also accredited to Zimbabwe, has been actively pursuing the case of Mr. Bennett. Our ambassador conveyed our serious concerns at a meeting with the acting director general of the Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry in Harare on 8 March. The ambassador has also raised Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case with a wide range of contacts during his regular visits to Zimbabwe, including the Zimbabwean Lawyers for Human Rights, the MDC and the much-respected figure of Archbishop Pius Ncube.</P>
      <P>The Government has chosen to raise Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case on account of the serious political and human rights issues that arise. Mr. Bennett is not an Irish citizen and, accordingly, we have no <Col N="1941"/>consular standing in the matter. Our embassy has not received any approaches from the Bennett family to intervene on his behalf. Our ambassador is extremely active in engaging with and working on behalf of the sizeable Irish community in Zimbabwe. As with the remainder of the Zimbabwean population, the Irish community in that country has many concerns arising from the serious political, human rights and humanitarian situation that prevails there.</P>
      <P>The ambassador and his diplomatic staff pay regular visits to Zimbabwe for the purpose of meeting the Irish community. In an effort to improve the level of consular service that we provide to our nationals in Zimbabwe, I have decided in principle to appoint an honorary consul general in Zimbabwe and will pursue the modalities of such an appointment with the Zimbabwean authorities.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with the UK, has also taken the lead in raising Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case at EU level and ensuring that EU ambassadors in Harare remain active on this matter. The EU is now taking steps to discuss the affair with the members of SADC, the Southern African Development Community, of which Zimbabwe is a member, as an example of the continuing failure of the Zimbabwean Government to improve the human rights situation in Zimbabwe in areas such as freedom of expression and association, despite commitments to do so in advance of this month&rsquo;s parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>I regret that efforts to appeal Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s sentencing in the Zimbabwean High Court have proved unsuccessful. He continues to be held in deplorable conditions in prison. A welcome and positive development, however, has been the decision of the new electoral court in Zimbabwe on 15 March to rule against efforts to disqualify Mr. Bennett and prevent him from standing in this month&rsquo;s elections. Pending an appeal the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission yesterday decided to lodge, Mr. Bennett has been cleared to stand in the poll in his Chimanimani district, which has been put back for one month and is due to take place on 30 April to provide a reasonable period for campaigning.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s treatment needs to be seen as part of an overall pattern of harassment, intimidation and violence that opposition politicians and supporters have faced in Zimbabwe for some years. The well documented incidents of violence and intimidation directed against Mr. Bennett and his family are, unfortunately, all too indicative of the repressive atmosphere currently prevailing in Zimbabwe. The overall human rights situation in Zimbabwe has, if anything, deteriorated since EU sanctions, targeted against the ruling elite, were first imposed in February 2002. In this regard, a particularly worrying development recently has been the adoption of legislation by the Zimbabwean Parliament that would severely restrict the operations of non-governmental organisations, particularly those in the human rights and humanitarian fields.</P><Col N="1942"/>
      <P>Ireland, both nationally and as part of the EU, has made known our concerns to the Zimbabwean authorities at ministerial level regarding the possible serious implications of this new legislation. The adoption of further repressive legislation of this type, along with the failure to make any real progress towards meeting the EU&rsquo;s benchmarks on improving respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe, left the Union with no choice but to renew its restrictive measures for a further 12 months when the External Relations Council considered the issue last month.</P>
      <P>It is against this unfavourable background that parliamentary elections have now been called for 31 March in Zimbabwe. This election will represent an important watershed for Zimbabwe and for testing whether there is a real willingness on the part of the Mugabe Government to implement political reforms and work to improve the situation in Zimbabwe as regards democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. The Government welcomes the fact that the MDC, despite the many obstacles it faces, has now chosen to participate in these elections.</P>
      <P>An important yardstick by which the Government and our EU partners will assess the elections which take place on 31 March are the guidelines for holding democratic elections adopted by SADC leaders at its summit in Mauritius last August. These principles cover, <i>inter alia</i>, full participation of citizens in the political process, freedom of association, political tolerance, equal access to the media for all parties and respecting the independence of the judiciary and the media. The Zimbabwean Government initially committed itself to comply with these guidelines but, to date, has not demonstrated sufficient intent to introduce the necessary changes to guarantee a free and fair election.</P>
      <P>While some positive changes have been made, they are very far from meeting the minimum threshold represented by the SADC guidelines. It is quite clear from the conduct of the election campaign to date that conditions that would equate to international standards for holding free and transparent elections cannot really be said to exist on the ground in Zimbabwe. Members of the MDC continue to be harassed and subject to state violence and arrest for attempting to campaign. Newspapers continue to be closed down by the Zimbabwean Government while the state-run broadcast media eschew any notion of balance in their campaign coverage.</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch has concluded in a report issued earlier this week that, due to the lack of respect demonstrated by the Zimbabwean Government for the basic freedoms prescribed in the SADC guidelines, the forthcoming elections are highly unlikely to reflect the free expression of the electorate. The Zimbabwean Government has also singularly failed to comply with the SADC guidelines in the manner in which it has belatedly issued invitations to a restricted number of countries and organisations to observe the <Col N="1943"/>elections. No EU country has been invited to send external observers. The Zimbabwean Government has also sought to exclude the SADC parliamentary forum, the only African group that criticised the conduct of the 2002 presidential elections as not being free and fair.</P>
      <P>The EU will be required to rely on those invited to monitor, including international and national NGOs, as well as the reports of EU diplomats based in Harare to form its assessment of the election outcome. The Government intends to seek accreditation for our ambassador in Pretoria to join with other EU resident ambassadors in observing the elections, subject to securing the necessary clearances. In the short period which now remains before the elections, Ireland and our EU partners are continuing to engage closely with the SADC and key member states such as South Africa, urging them to use all the influence they have to ensure that, even at this late stage, Zimbabwe complies to the fullest extent possible with the SADC guidelines in advance of the elections.</P>
      <P>I also hope the SADC will report objectively on the conduct of the elections, including by indicating clearly where the Zimbabwean Government has failed to comply in substance or in spirit with the SADC guidelines. Along with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to press for the lifting of repressive legislation and greater respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. We will ensure that the closest possible attention is given to the deplorable human rights situation in Zimbabwe at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to follow closely the case of Mr. Bennett and others who have been unfairly imprisoned in Zimbabwe and will use what influence we have to press for an early review of his unjust sentencing and consequential release. Accordingly, I am happy to commend the terms of this motion to the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for agreeing to share time with me on this important motion.</P>
      <P>As parliamentarians, we should not underestimate the significance of today&rsquo;s debate and the influence we can bring to bear on the plight of a fellow parliamentarian whose human rights are being denied. I express my thanks to my colleague, Deputy Howlin, a fellow member for many years of a European parliamentary network organisation, AEPA, Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, who raised Roy Bennett&rsquo;s case with me some weeks ago, putting forward the possibility of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann highlighting Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case. I recall that during the late 1980s, shortly after my election to the D&aacute;il, at the height of the apartheid regime in South Africa, Deputy Howlin, I and other col<Col N="1944"/>leagues in this House met the ANC in Harare and Lusaka. These were days when Mr. Mugabe and company were highly regarded internationally as they led the push for freedom and democracy in South Africa.</P>
      <P>This motion is before the House thanks to the support of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and my staff. Deputy Nolan informed me last night that Mr. David Coltard, MP, a colleague of Roy Bennett in Zimbabwe and spokesman on justice for the MDC, contacted the Deputy to say that there is considerable awareness in Zimbabwe of our debate today. He told Deputy Nolan that we have given him and others great encouragement and confidence in their campaign.</P>
      <P>Like many others in this House, I am greatly concerned at the treatment of Roy Bennett and the arbitrary manner in which he has been sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment for an offence which ordinarily would attract only a very small fine on conviction in a civil court. As parliamentarians, I believe we are all affronted by the procedures used by the ZANU-PF majority in the Zimbabwean Parliament in convicting and sentencing Roy Bennett. While not condoning in any way Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s behaviour which resulted in his imprisonment, it is clear there was no real effort by those who subsequently heard his case to ensure justice or provide him with a fair and impartial hearing. This departure from internationally accepted parliamentary norms has been protested by speakers of other parliaments. I urge the Ceann Comhairle to make known the very strong views of the House on this matter by conveying the terms of our motion to the speaker of the Zimbabwean Parliament.</P>
      <P>Roy Bennett&rsquo;s treatment sadly illustrates the climate of oppression and lack of respect for human rights which prevails in Zimbabwe today. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that an underlying motivation in jailing Mr. Bennett has been a desire on the part of those in power in Zimbabwe to silence a vocal critic of the regime. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has outlined the various steps which the Government has taken to raise Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s case. Ireland has urged action at EU level and steps are being taken to express the Union&rsquo;s concerns to Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours in the SADC community. I just returned from South Africa last week and availed of the opportunity to make known our concerns on Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s treatment to the political leaders whom I met there. We must continue to urge SADC members to use whatever influence they can to improve the political and human rights situation in Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>We are just one week away from important parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe. Unfortunately, the conduct of the campaign to date does not give great cause for optimism that the people of Zimbabwe will be able to participate in a free and fair poll next Thursday. Numerous reports by organisations such as Amnesty International and the Law Society of Zimbabwe have highlighted <Col N="1945"/>how intimidatory tactics and the use of repressive legislation have stifled political debate and ensured the playing field is not level for all competing parties. Even at this late stage, one can only urge the Zimbabwean Government to honour its commitments to comply fully with the SADC guidelines for the holding of democratic elections. It will be important to base any judgment on the election outcome on the degree to which there has been compliance with these guidelines. As mentioned by the Minister, efforts are being made to enable the Irish Ambassador in South Africa to be present in Zimbabwe to monitor the elections with other EU ambassadors.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to remain active on the issue of Zimbabwe in the coming months. The people of Zimbabwe deserve a better future than the failed policies pursued by the Mugabe Government. Ireland and its EU partners will continue efforts to ensure that this better future is delivered. One way in which the Zimbabwe Government can demonstrate willingness to reform is to review the unjust sentencing of Roy Bennett. The Government will continue to press for this and will remain active on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s debate is unprecedented. Today we remove our political party shirts and collectively wear our national colours in uniting behind the case of Roy Bennett. I am confident that our efforts and the efforts of other parliaments throughout the world will make a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I am delighted to support the motion concerning the imprisonment of Roy Bennett, described as a man of the people but an enemy of the state. His imprisonment is a shameful act by a shameless Government.</P>
      <P>One of the disappointing aspects of the recent by-elections in Meath and Kildare North was the low turn-out at the polls. Why did so many people not bother to exercise their democratic right and have their say through the ballot box? This should be a matter of concern to all of us who believe that participation is the key to ensuring a robust democracy. It is too easy to take the fact of our open democracy for granted. Candidates stand for election, fight campaigns and, ultimately, the people decide whether they will be given the responsibility of representation. However, the social stability that our democracy engenders works against it in terms of voter turn-out. Many people simply do not realise how lucky they are to have a vote and a Government that, while not perfect, is directly elected though a free and fair process. This is a privilege not accorded to millions of people worldwide.</P>
      <P>This is especially true when we look at the situation in countries like Zimbabwe, which is due to hold elections in a few days. The international community must have grave concerns at the conduct of these elections as we are all aware of the conduct of past elections in that country. For the upcoming polls, the Zimbabwean <Col N="1946"/>Government indicated that it would conduct these elections in accordance with the principles and guidelines on democratic elections adopted by the Southern African Development Community in August 2004. However, there has been little sign of compliance. The European Union has not been invited to observe the upcoming elections, although other countries have been belatedly invited as observers.</P>
      <P>I began with a reference to the recent by-elections held in Ireland. At a meeting of the European affairs committee earlier this month, the chairman of the Zimbabwean section of Amnesty International drew some important parallels between the then upcoming elections in Ireland and those in Zimbabwe. These parallels are frightening in bringing home to all of us the difficulties and dangers that political activists face in Zimbabwe today. At the meeting the chairman said:</P>
      <P LI="1">If Zimbabwean conditions existed in Meath and Kildare, we would be horrified and scandalised. If we knew that half of the people running in the by-election were not sleeping in their own homes and were afraid to walk the streets of Navan or Kildare for fear of being murdered and that they had to escape out of the country and lived in seclusion, we would take the situation seriously. If a political party felt it had a stronghold in a particular residential area and it terrorised the community and informed it that it could discover whether people had voted for it, and if it cut the tongue from a member of the community to show how serious it was in its intimidation, we would take the situation seriously. These are some of the situations that occur in Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The situation in Zimbabwe has been deteriorating for years and is of considerable concern to many countries. In February 2005, the European Union renewed its common position imposing targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe. However, systematic harassment of the members of the Movement for Democratic Change continues. That party is campaigning in the upcoming elections under the constant threat of violence or arbitrary arrest. The Zimbabwean Government continues its campaign of repression, which is aimed clearly at eliminating political opposition and silencing dissent. During 2004, hundreds of people were arrested for holding meetings or participating in peaceful protests. The police, army, youth militia and supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front were implicated in numerous human rights violations, including torture, assault and arbitrary arrest.</P>
      <P>In the past two years alone, the Zimbabwean Government has banned four newspapers and continues to use repressive legislation to disrupt the work of the MDC. Amnesty International recently stated that in its monitoring of the situation in Zimbabwe, it has witnessed the persistent and systematic violation of human rights <Col N="1947"/>by the State against the supporters of the opposition. In the run-up to elections in Zimbabwe, these occurrences must be of concern to us all. During this campaign there has reportedly been a significant level of harassment directed against opposition MDC candidates. There are reports of MDC MPs, candidates and campaigners being arrested and harassed during the course of campaigning. MPs have been arrested for holding meetings or for engaging in door-to-door canvassing. Whilst people are often detained for only a short period of time, their detention is a disgrace and hampers the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, association and assembly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A basic principle of our electoral system is the secrecy of the ballot box but in Zimbabwe this secrecy has been significantly undermined. Reports indicate that people have been told that their votes will be seen and that ZANU-PF workers will know which way they have voted. Furthermore, votes will be counted <i>in situ</i> and the message has been put out that the Government will therefore know how many people in a locality voted for the opposition. The underlying threat is that this information will then be used against the local community.</P>
      <P>It is in this context that I wish to address the case of Roy Bennett &mdash; man of the people, enemy of the state. In October 2004, Mr. Bennett was sentenced to 15 months in prison with hard labour. This sentence was handed down to him by the Mugabe-controlled Parliament, not by a court of law, through the use of a parliamentary procedure that failed to meet the requirements of a fair trial. The reason for this very harsh sentence was that Roy Bennett had pushed Patrick Chinamasa, the Zimbabwean Minister of Justice, in response to provocative jibes from Chinamasa that Bennett&rsquo;s ancestors were &ldquo;thieves and murderers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bennett was denied the right to appeal against this sentence and was placed in Harare central prison. Towards the end of November 2004, he was transferred to Mutoko prison in north-east Zimbabwe, thereby restricting access to him by his family and legal team. The speaker of the Zimbabwean Parliament blocked attempts through the courts by lawyers acting for Mr. Bennett to achieve his release , although the High Court of Zimbabwe heard an application on his behalf in early November. A decision on his application was not delivered, however, until mid-February when bail was denied.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions, Mr. Bennett has apologised for pushing the Minister for Justice to the ground. However, this act provided ZANU-PF with an ideal opportunity to step up the campaign of harassment to which Bennett has been subjected. The unprecedented severity of the sentence was only the latest act of vengeance inflicted upon Bennett, who with his family and workers has been the target of a sustained campaign of persecution in recent years.</P><Col N="1948"/>
      <P>Some of the workers on Bennett&rsquo;s farm have been murdered, while others have been raped. ZANU-PF members overran his home during the 2000 election campaign and the stress of that incident caused his wife to have a miscarriage. His business is in tatters and he is now in prison. There are reports that he has been subjected to the most degrading and inhuman treatment, including serious beatings.</P>
      <P>What is Bennett&rsquo;s real crime? Without doubt it is that he is an extremely popular representative for the opposition, he is a vocal critic of the antics of the Mugabe administration that puts democracy to shame, and he refuses to be cowed into submission. Since his election to Parliament he has stood for human rights and the rule of law. It is for these reasons that this vile campaign has been instigated against him. For his beliefs, he is incarcerated under a regime of hard labour and his wife is allowed to see him for approximately ten minutes every two weeks.</P>
      <P>Almost two years ago, Roy Bennett addressed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding human rights in Zimbabwe. In early February this year, his case was raised in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. On that occasion, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs stated that the Irish ambassador in South Africa would intervene on behalf of Mr. Bennett. The Minister of State also agreed that a representative of the Government would raise the matter directly with the Government of Zimbabwe. I would appreciate an update on these matters. Perhaps the Government could clarify the nature of the response received from the Government of Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>The Government of Robert Mugabe has used every opportunity to silence criticism and dissent, and to ensure that Mugabe retains control of the country that was once Africa&rsquo;s most important producer of food. Under his administration, however, food production has been so badly disturbed that the spectre of food shortages and famine is worryingly close for many people. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is only 39 years, far below standards in the European Union.</P>
      <P>For many in Zimbabwe the food situation is extremely perilous. In December 2004, there was a one-off distribution of food to 1.6 million people by the World Food Programme. This programme operates in the country only when it is allowed to do so by the government, which had previously stated that the 2004 harvest had been extremely plentiful. In light of the needs of close to 2 million people for emergency food aid, it appears that the Zimbabwean Government is simply engaging in propaganda in its statements regarding food production.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a functioning democracy in which people can engage freely in elections and electioneering, criticising the State or the Government, and proposing change and reform where they see fit. Our democracy is not without threats or challenges but each member of society is afforded a level of freedom that is denied to many in other parts of the world.</P><Col N="1949"/>
      <P>In light of the elections in Zimbabwe, the international community must continue to make every effort to speak against the manipulation of the electoral process as well as harassment and murder. Regimes such as that in Zimbabwe put the fundamental principles of democracy to shame. We must highlight this without fear or favour.</P>
      <P>Roy Bennett&rsquo;s incarceration continues; his imprisonment is a shameful act by a shameless government. The Irish Government, and all members of the D&aacute;il, must unite to call for his immediate release and must be a thorn in the side of the Zimbabwean Government until his release is achieved.</P>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt, for enabling this unprecedented debate to take place. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has championed the cause of African affairs over a long period. Since his appointment, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has expressed an interest in connecting the Oireachtas to development issues in a way that has not been done effectively in the  past. I congratulate him on having taken that step.</P>
      <P>This is an unusual debate. Often we have been insular in dealing with such issues by way of parliamentary questions or the occasional Adjournment debate. However, to table such a matter as a formal motion is an indication of the seriousness with which this sovereign Parliament regards the situation. It is also an indication of the maturity of our own democracy where we have a role to play in spreading the values of democracy and human rights. Ireland has an honourable tradition in this regard; it was not a colonial power. We are respected in Africa as an independent voice that does not come with baggage. We are now significant players in terms of development co-operation, given the funds the Oireachtas votes for use in Africa.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the motion but before dealing with it in detail, I will make some general observations in referring to the situation in Africa as a whole. There is a view that Africa is a hopeless case and some people despair of ever seeing development within the continent. I reject that view, however, because Africa is a place of hope. There are many difficulties and challenges besetting the African continent but there is a tremendous movement for democratic change, bedding down democracy, institutionalising human rights and placing <i>in situ</i> in every country on that continent instruments to monitor human rights. The best signs of this are the development of the African Union, the inaugurations of the Pan-African Parliament and the establishment of an African peer review mechanism whereby standards and international norms are reviewed and monitored, not by external forces from North America or Europe but by Africans themselves. <Col N="1950"/>These are important developments. However, as citizens of the world, we have a right to comment on affairs in other nations.</P>
      <P>The situation in Zimbabwe is an extremely worrying one. As other speakers have noted, Zimbabwe was a shining light, full of hope and optimism, in the immediate years after independence, and some of us had the privilege of meeting Robert Mugabe in those early years. The transcript of the proceedings in the Roy Bennett case in the Zimbabwean Parliament shows that one of the witnesses, a Member of Parliament who alleged that Mr. Bennett had assaulted him too, was one Didymus Mutasa. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will remember this honourable gentleman welcoming us to Zimbabwe as the then Speaker of the Parliament. We know these people and their ability. We have offered and continue to offer the hand of friendship to them. However, since that time of optimism and hope, when Zimbabwe was a front-line state, newly independent and offering the basis for a multi-racial democracy &mdash; a model almost for what might be in South Africa, then under the yoke of apartheid &mdash; we have seen the hope and promise crushed by a regime that refuses to cede power and, instead, seeks to continue in power by using the instruments of repression and terror.</P>
      <P>The past five years in particular have seen a serious deterioration in the human rights situation in Zimbabwe, not only in informal actions but in the enactment of formal regressive legislation. This series of enactments, aimed at suppressing the rights of free expression, free association, free assembly and free dissemination of information, is characterised by the intimidation of any voice of opposition to the regime. For those of us who respect and admire Africa, who were hopeful and remain optimistic for the future, what has happened in Zimbabwe is a cause of pain and deep regret. We have a responsibility, therefore, not simply to decry the instruments of repression against the norms of democracy and human rights but to do something about it, as comrade parliamentarians, to use a phrase the ZANU-PF Administration would understand.</P>
      <P>The instruments of repression have been institutionalised in Zimbabwe despite its membership of and accession to a number of international covenants on political rights and freedoms. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted, Zimbabwe has endorsed the SADC principles and guidelines governing democratic elections. It is a sad joke that the notions of free and fair elections, free assembly and free expression should be entirely undermined, ignored and crushed by the same regimes that notionally adhere to and endorse them.</P>
      <P>The case this House is addressing is that of Mr. Roy Bennett. I am impressed but not surprised that Zimbabwe would watch this debate and I am glad to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, that his information is that this is the case. It is important that those who are striving to pro<Col N="1951"/>tect the norms and decency of human rights and democratic values know that they have allies elsewhere who will stand by them, watch them and not abandon them. Roy Bennett is a Member of Parliament in Zimbabwe representing the Chimanimani district since 2000. He is a native Zimbabwean whose grandfather went to then Rhodesia from this island in 1889. He speaks fluent Shona and has deep and lifelong roots in and commitment to his country, Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>The irony is that he was originally approached by ZANU-PF to stand for Parliament for the Chimanimani district. However, the ZANU-PF central committee did not accept his nomination and he subsequently became a member of the Movement for Democratic Change, the official voice and organ of opposition to the Mugabe regime. There is documented evidence of the pattern of harassment and intimidation which Mr. Bennett and his family endured subsequent to his election, enunciated by some of my colleagues in the House, such as attacks on his farm and farm workers, invasion of his land, illegal annexation of his property and physical threats of violence and death. Unfortunately, his experiences are far from unique in the current climate in Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>Matters came to a head in a nasty exchange in the Zimbabwean Parliament in May of last year when Roy Bennett pushed over the Minister for Justice, Patrick Chinamasa. Undeniably, this is unacceptable behaviour for a parliamentarian. It would have consequences in any parliament and in most would result in a period of suspension. However, the consequences for Mr. Bennett were grossly excessive. As we have heard, no court proceedings were held. Instead, a committee of the Parliament dominated by the majority party held its own hearings and decided in an unprecedented fashion to sentence Mr. Bennett to 15 months including labour, three months of which was suspended.</P>
      <P>Twelve months with labour is a grossly excessive sentence for what would normally attract a reprimand in most parliaments, and, if it went through the normal court procedure, perhaps a fine. Clearly, the motivation of those who enacted such a vengeful judgment on Mr. Bennett was to silence a voice of opposition. They expected to prevent Mr. Bennett standing in the Zimbabwean elections which are due to be held on 31 March, just one week from now. I am pleased to hear from the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that the objective of disqualifying Mr. Bennett from standing in these elections has not been achieved. Pending the denial of the appeal which the Zimbabwe electoral commission intended to lodge, I hope Mr. Bennett will be a candidate and allowed to contest the elections on 30 April, one month behind the rest of the country to allow for campaigning to take place. This would at least be a positive development in an altogether dreadful situation.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that, as parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to speak out. The role of Ireland <Col N="1952"/>is an honourable one. We have a voice that is respected. President Mugabe cannot denounce us, for example, as he did the UK, as having a vested interest or colonial tradition, or as sinners. We are not a coloniser. Ireland was a poor country that through its own efforts developed its own economy, society and norms. We are far from perfect but we reserve to ourselves the right to speak out in pursuit of justice and human rights.</P>
      <P>The situation in Zimbabwe is one of the dark shadows over Africa. It is facing into an electoral process which, going by reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, is fundamentally flawed, with incidents already reported of ballot boxes being stuffed, and where there is no notion of a free campaigning atmosphere for those who oppose the current regime.</P>
      <P>Ireland must speak out. I welcome the initiative we have taken in tabling this resolution. It will have an impact. I believe it will be read and carried in the media in Zimbabwe. While it might not appear on the official State-sponsored programmes of the media, it will reach those who need more than anyone else to hear a supportive word. They are the people who are determined to establish the norms of human rights, the freedoms of assembly and free expression and the ability of the individual Zimbabwean, whatever his or her ethnic background, to speak fearlessly of his or her views on the future of the country and to express his or her democratic choice for parliament and government without fear or favour. I hope that this resolution and this joint approach across all benches in this House will be the first of many.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the heady optimism of 20 years ago in Zimbabwe when I was a school child humming along to the words of Stevie Wonder, &ldquo;Peace has come to Zimbabwe&rdquo;. Sadly, those words were optimistic and there are enormous difficulties in that country. Even in the past ten years there has been a steady decline in the economic and social life of Zimbabwe. Today, 60% of the population live on less than $1 a day, unemployment is at 70% and inflation is over 100% annually. The land redistribution programme is disrupting agricultural production and leaving farm workers without homes or jobs. Mass hunger is a real possibility as the Government has neither the funds nor the credit to replenish its food reserves.</P>
      <P>There is strong evidence that there will be very unfair tactics in the forthcoming election. We know that Mugabe is making it harder for some people to vote and easier for others. The effect of all this will be to consolidate his power over Zimbabwe. Even election observers in previous elections there have been intimidated and have <Col N="1953"/>had their fluorescent jackets with the words &ldquo;election observer&rdquo; on them ripped off their backs. Others were arrested.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said that Mugabe has become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. We must send a clear signal from Europe that we want democracy in Africa, in Zimbabwe, that we want fairness and rule of law and that we do not want to see scare tactics used to intimidate parliamentarians and others.</P>
      <P>I do not for a moment condone the actions of Mr. Bennett &mdash; I suspect that what he did was not unlike scenes I have witnessed in the chamber of Dublin City Council over the years. I have not witnessed them in this Chamber but I am sure some Deputies have seen something similar at local level. We accept the rough and tumble of politics. None of us would like to see someone pushed into a corner. My colleague, Deputy Sargent, was shoved into a corner by some of his colleagues when he held up a cheque in the Dublin City Council chamber a few years ago but those people were not sent to jail for a year. Some people might have been happy if the Deputy&rsquo;s then colleagues had been sent to jail and some of us are hoping that through the good work of the Mahon tribunal people will be sent to jail for much more heinous crimes than pushing people about in a council chamber.</P>
      <P>I do not condone the actions of Mr. Bennett but I do not believe for one second that he should be sentenced to hard labour for a year as a result of his actions, nor do I believe that a personal vendetta should be put in place by the leader of Zimbabwe to ensure that he is silenced and that his wife is stopped from running in the forthcoming election.</P>
      <P>Motions such as these have real value. They send out a strong signal of concern. While it is easy for us in a Chamber far from Zimbabwe to criticise, we simply want to send out a message that we want to see democracy and rule of law, and that we want to see Zimbabwe not as a dictatorship but as a paragon of democracy. Despite the concerns of recent years, that can still happen.</P>

Those killers have never been brought to justice despite that these murders, with the <i>imprimatur</i> of British intelligence, took place over a decade ago. The O&rsquo;Hagan and Fullerton families also deserve truth and justice, the same as any other family bereaved by the conflict.</P>
      <P>Just as we have concerns about human rights violations against democratically elected public representatives, we also have other, perhaps greater, concerns about the general grievous human rights situation in Zimbabwe. The upcoming elections have no chance of being free and fair. Last month&rsquo;s mission by Amnesty International found persistent, long-term and systematic human rights violations. Among these were attacks on at least 855 of the opposition members of the Parliament, including torture and assault. <Col N="1955"/>There is continued government intimidation, arbitrary arrests of opposition candidates and supporters and political manipulation of fuel distribution on which millions of Zimbabweans depend. According to UNICEF, 20 Zimbabweans die of HIV-AIDS every hour, yet this is not a political issue for any political party in the upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>These are not the greatest concerns we have about the human rights situation in Africa in general. I am at a loss as to why statements on this political issue have been prioritised given that the Government has not yet provided time for statements on the horrific ongoing conflict in Darfur, especially after evidence that Ireland may have been culpable with regard to the supply of arms in this conflict. Neither has time been provided for statements on the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis with a death toll outstripping even that in Darfur according to the UN emergency relief co-ordinator, Jan Egeland.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to call on the Government to make time for separate statements on the crisis in Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo as soon as possible. I also take the opportunity to express our concerns on the case of Roy Bennett and on the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this discussion and to give my full support to this Government motion. On 21 February 2005 the European Council adopted a common position renewing the restrictive measures against Zimbabwe. This means that the extension of sanctions against Zimbabwe will be continued until February 2006 when they will again be reviewed in light of the parliamentary elections due to be held at the end of this month. The sanctions against Zimbabwe were put in place in February 2002 for 12 months. They were renewed in February 2003 and 2004 because the Zimbabwean Government continued to violate the partnership agreement. Conditions in Zimbabwe did not ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. The European Council now states that since February 2004, there has been no progress on these issues with no commitments from the Zimbabwean Government to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>According to various sources, the situation in Zimbabwe is dreadful. The Zimbabwean Government continues its campaign of repression with the aim of eliminating all political opposition and silencing those who criticise the regime. Hundreds of people have been arrested simply for participating in peaceful protest. Torture and assault are routine. A journalist who secretly crossed the Zimbabwean border recently reported in <i>The New York Times</i> yesterday that villagers told him that bad as it was when the white supremacists were in power under Ian <Col N="1956"/>Smith, who looked down on them as if they were inferior and beneath them, at least they had food and could eat meat. Now under the current government all they have to eat is gruel, and not much of that. Not only are basic human rights denied to people on a massive scale, the people are hungry.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said earlier. It is important that the Oireachtas expresses its grave concern about the situation in Zimbabwe. Yesterday, the Joint Committee on European Affairs agreed a statement which expressed its concern about the human rights situation. It also expressed support for the Government with regard to the case of Roy Bennett, an opposition member of the Zimbabwean Parliament who has been imprisoned in Zimbabwe. The joint committee urges the Zimbabwean Government to take action to bring about an end to politically motivated violence and ensure the freedom of the media and the independence of the judiciary.</P>
      <P>With regard to the case of Roy Bennett MP, who has stood up for human rights and the rule of law and whose family has been harassed and tortured while he is held under terrible conditions in prison, I commend the efforts of the Government and the European Union in trying to secure his release.</P>
      <P>According to Amnesty International, one of the most sinister twists in the campaign to suppress the opposition has been the non-violent abuse of rights. That sounds like it might mean progress. However, as the delegation from Amnesty International that visited Zimbabwe last month was repeatedly told, the ruling party no longer needs to engage in violence. The people know from their experience of the past four years what the regime is capable of.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen spoke about the low turnout in the recent by-elections in North Kildare and Meath. Perhaps we have become too complacent, but at least when canvassers were going from door to door in Meath and North Kildare, all they had to contend with were questions from the electorate. In Zimbabwe, however, members of the MDC are arrested when canvassing from door to door. They are only detained for a short period and then released. The outcome is to hamper all efforts at campaigning in a sinister and pervasive manner. The secrecy of the ballot is also undermined. Many, especially those in rural areas, have been convinced that their vote will not be secret and that there will be retribution for those who vote for the opposition.</P>
      <P>Violence against women continues to be a major concern, with assault and rape used by security forces and the ZANU-PF youth. Youth training camps have been set up to indoctrinate large numbers of young people. Many people are brutalised in these camps and there are reports of the use of rape and drugs. In violent situations women often hold families, communities and neighbourhoods together. By increasing the levels of violence against women, the government <Col N="1957"/>does not just threaten individual women, dreadful though that is, but threatens the fabric of the community.</P>
      <P>With just a week to go to the Zimbabwean elections, we must maintain a strong international focus on trying to ensure fair elections. As Deputy Howlin said, we are at least sending a message of solidarity to the people of Zimbabwe that we are their allies. I hope they know this. I wholeheartedly commend this motion.</P>

      <P>Again, I thank all Members who contributed and urge them to maintain whatever pressures they can bring to bear on the case. I thank Deputy Howlin for his kind comments.

    <Title>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 <?oasys _cf1-?>[<?oasys _cf2-?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1-?>]<?oasys _cf3-?>: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important legislation but before I refer to its contents and make a number of suggestions, I thank and commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on his handling of the case of the Nigerian student, Olunkunle Elunhanla, who is being allowed to return to his studies in Ireland. It is not a sign of weakness when somebody in political office stands up and accepts he or she made a mistake, and many Members will support this sentiment.</P>
      <P>Policing is a significant issue. Society has major problems and policing and crime are at the top of the political agenda because it is time to address these serious issues. The Garda should always be professional and accountable and, above all, it should work for the community with the support and respect of the community. The Garda needs the confidence of the people but it must earn their respect to gain their confidence. Those of us who have experienced varying levels of quality of policing services will always recognise that when garda&iacute; focus on their jobs, they gradually build respect. This usually results in less crime and a more open society.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the commissioner must be part of the debate. Honesty and integrity are <Col N="1958"/>needed in policing as opposed to hearsay. However, while all the legislation in the world can be passed, the people on the ground must implement it properly and fairly. This applies to all services, including those provided by nurses, teachers, firemen and other professionals. Those who provide such services must be dedicated and committed, and this is a crucial element of criminal justice legislation.</P>
      <P>I refer to the proposed changes in the Garda and in crime prevention. I hear the following comments on a regular basis at my clinics: &ldquo;At present there is no visible police patrol in our area&rdquo;, &ldquo;There is a lack of a consistent visible police presence in the community&rdquo; and &ldquo;Garda foot patrols are a must&rdquo;. People want a visible Garda presence on the streets both day and night. They believe that a squad car driving around an area occasionally does not prevent crime. Research has shown that 70% of public order incidents occur on weekend nights. This important information is provided by the public, to whom we should listen.</P>
      <P>People drink and smoke hash openly in flats in my constituency. Garda data show that 70% of recorded public order incidents occur between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Drug addicts inject themselves in public places in Dublin, a sight which causes distress to members of the public who feel threatened by such overt drug abuse on the streets and a perception of lawlessness often ensues. It is also horrific that 63% of women in a survey, as opposed to 49% of men, felt they or someone in their household might become a victim of crime.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two main objectives. One is to reform the law relating to the administration and management of the Garda, in particular, the respective roles of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister. This follows from a 2002 report on performance and accountability in the Garda, which was developed under the strategic management initiative and recommended significant reform. The other main objective of the legislation is to provide for the establishment of an independent body to be known as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Garda inspectorate, which will have the power to investigate complaints. The primary function of the commission will be to investigate complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda and it will replace the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board, which was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Act 1986.</P>
      <P>Recently three incidents in my constituency were raised at my clinics. First, there was an armed robbery of a local shop during which &euro;6,000 was taken and the female shop owner was absolutely traumatised by the events. Second, the elderly in my community are constantly intimidated and threatened with violence. Third, off-licence staff have been regularly attacked and threatened. They are often blamed for selling alcohol to minors but they are often threatened <Col N="1959"/>by them. Such staff are constantly physically threatened and their cars are damaged. A total of 27 attacks have taken place in my constituency recently. These issues must be highlighted.</P>
      <P>Section 16 provides for the establishment by the Minister of a code of ethics for the Garda, which will be incorporated into its disciplinary framework. The purpose of the code is to lay down standards of conduct and practice for members of the Garda and to make them aware of their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. This is an excellent section because it places an emphasis on human rights. Those of us who regularly stand up for human rights are often labelled as being soft on crime, which is a myth and misrepresentation. I have encountered a scandalous scenario where a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor who works for the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, has distributed leaflets in my constituency which state that my contributions in the House support criminality. That is a load of nonsense.</P>
      <P>I challenged the Minister of State and his hack on Dublin City Council about this disgraceful leaflet. They have a brass neck to lecture me on recent developments in Northern Ireland and on my contribution to the peace process. I will always defend human rights to the maximum. I challenge the Minister of State to stop hiding behind a local councillor when such leaflets are distributed in my area. They have a brass neck to lecture me on human rights and on my commitment to the peace process. The record of the House speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>The Bill will involve a power-sharing partnership in which the community and the police will work together to address the underlying factors leading to crime. I refer to core principles which should be adopted. We need to intervene early to prevent people going off the rails and doing harm to victims, the community and themselves. I support restorative justice. It can provide victims with an understanding of the offender, which removes much of the fear while giving them the satisfaction that justice has been served. It also provides offenders with a sense that the legal process seeks to be helpful and treats them fairly.</P>
      <P>Section 31 provides that the Minister may issue guidelines for the establishment and maintenance by the local authority and the Garda of a joint policing committee.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate because it is important. I urge the Minister to listen to the sensible views on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policy generally. We must have accountability and one person, one job. We must focus on the Garda as a profession. We must have promotion on merit. We need honesty and we must reach out to the community. Only then will we have a top-class Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a quality policing service.</P>

The business before the House today has been on our agenda for some time and we are working through it.</P>
      <P>Like other colleagues and my deputy leader, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, I applaud the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the Nigerian student. I told the Minister yesterday that I had been at the protest march outside the House and my colleague, Deputy Curran, raised the matter by way of a reasonable statement on the Adjournment debate on Tuesday night.

	<P>It is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>To be fair, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on behalf of the Government, listened to what was said by Deputy Curran and other supporters of the student and a decision has been taken.</P>
      <P>On the business before the House, we should remind ourselves that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill was presented to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in February 2004 and passed by the Seanad, after much debate, on 17 December. When enacted, it will replace, with only one or two exceptions, all the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts, which I understand date back to 1924.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for reform in three key areas, the first of which is the structures for the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular by clarifying the role and objectives of the force and defining its relationship with the Government of the day. The provisions in this regard are set out <Col N="1961"/>in Part 2 and they reflect the outcome of a review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government&rsquo;s strategic management initiative. It addresses the existing mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing for the establishment of a new independent body to be known as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to replace the existing Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board. I support that. The provisions in this regard are set out in Parts 3 and 4 and are in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to establish a new body with the powers of an ombudsman to investigate complaints. The ombudsman commission will have comprehensive powers of civil and criminal investigation to deal with complaints and will have ultimate control and oversight of all complaints processed in accordance with the Bill.</P>
      <P>It also deals with the existing accountability arrangements by providing for the establishment of an independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate as a means of improving democratic accountability for the actions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The provisions in this regard are set out in Part 5. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate will examine policy issues with standards, practice and performance benchmarked to comparable international policing experiences. The key objective will be to ensure and promote efficiency and effectiveness in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to provide independent and objective advice to the Minister on the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The joint committee sought submissions on the Bill and we are now working through those. We have held a number of public hearings and will continue that process today. Those of us who participated in the hearings were very impressed by the submissions made to us. The remit is fairly broad and we are getting many different views from national and community-based organisations.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the drugs task forces were before the committee yesterday, as were representatives of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. I mention that organisation in particular because its representatives made two very interesting points yesterday. They talked about the need for independent community representation on the boards, which is an interesting point, although there are other points of view.</P>
      <P>That particular issue was raised during the Seanad debate. The changes involved provided for representation on the committee at town council level and removal of the county and city development boards model. In addition, the provisions relating to the guidelines governing the establishment of the committees have been extended to include Members of the Oireachtas, not just the D&aacute;il; nomination of members of local authorities; the appointment of a chairperson from the local authority members; nomination by the Commissioner of the Garda; the establishment of sub-committees; the term of office for the committee; the application of qualified privilege; <Col N="1962"/>the attendance of bodies and persons before the committee; an enabling type provision to allow for the guidelines to facilitate the attendance of Members of the Oireachtas; and the circumstances in which meetings of the committee may be held other than in public. Those points were made in other debates on the legislation which provided for the abolition of health boards.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting the notion that community representation be facilitated, which is a good idea. Like myself, most Members came from a community representation background. I have no difficulty with that but we should not be afraid to stand up, as the Senators did, for the rights of those of us who are elected because scant regard is often had for the role of the elected public representative. For example, the partnerships precluded elected public representatives from involvement. I was a member of the Tallaght Partnership in 1991 and I was upset, on becoming a member of the council, having put my name forward and being elected by the public, to be told I did not qualify as a member of the partnership. The partnerships have changed in that regard. Elected public representatives throughout the country of all persuasions are entitled to represent their communities on these bodies.</P>
      <P>On community representation, it is worth making the point that if advantage is not taken of the experience of public representatives of all persuasions, the system of selecting community representatives will be more convoluted. The point was made in the committee yesterday that that will be very difficult. The Seanad proposal in that regard is important and we should be supportive of it.</P>
      <P>Another point made yesterday in the joint committee concerned anti-social behaviour. The Minister made the point &mdash; I raised the matter in the D&aacute;il last night &mdash; that he is bringing forward proposals in the context of this Bill. We can all talk about the need to deal with crime in our communities and to support the Garda, which is the body to address the problem of crime in our area, but we must not encourage private armies or people going around meting out justice in various ways.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We must continue to pay attention to serious crime. Colleagues listed various crimes in the debate yesterday and in committee. The level of petty crime in all our communities &mdash; the position is no different in Cork, north Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire from that in my constituency in Tallaght &mdash; and anti-social behaviour has become a modern phenomenon. Many people talk about the need to deal with the matter. Civil liberties groups argued yesterday that we should not try to break a nut with a hammer. If one speaks to community workers, elderly people and young people in the various communities, one will get a clear sense that there is a need to deal with anti-social behaviour in an effective manner. Such people argue <Col N="1963"/>that there is a need for a community policing presence on the ground.</P>
      <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin South-West, which includes Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and Brittas. It is an area with a huge population &mdash; there is an electorate of more than 70,000 people in my local area &mdash; but there is just one Garda station there. Parts of the constituency are looked after, in effect, by garda&iacute; from other stations, such as Crumlin, Terenure, Rathfarnham and Rathcoole.</P>
      <P>In a debate of this nature, it is reasonable to point out that my community needs more Garda facilities. There is an ongoing campaign to modernise Tallaght Garda station. There may be a need to pull it down and rebuild it on the site or elsewhere. The future Garda needs of Dublin South-West need to be addressed. I hope the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will continue to pay attention to the matter. I understand that a report from the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s office in that regard is expected to be sent to the Minister. I hope that progress can be made thereafter. I ask the Minister to ensure that action is taken to meet the Garda station needs of the area I represent.</P>
      <P>An organisation in the Tallaght area is involved in a further campaign to ensure that facilities are put in place on foot of the significant development that is taking place in west Tallaght. All the local Deputies have raised issues relating to west Tallaght. I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Glennon, is familiar with such issues. Community groups have argued that there is a need for a second Garda station in the western part of Tallaght. I hope the Minister will have some news in that regard sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that Deputies should not be involved in making a case for their local areas &mdash; on the contrary, I am often impressed when they do so. A Deputy called yesterday for more Garda manpower in a certain rural community and I had no problem with that. There is a small rural community in Bohernabreena in my constituency. Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country, after Dublin and Cork. It has a greater population than Limerick. I do not like to be simple about it, but it is a numbers game &mdash; Tallaght needs more garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Members who are familiar with Tallaght know that for a long time after the population explosion in the mid-1970s, it had the population of a city but the status of a village. All that changed on 23 October 1990, however, when the Square shopping centre was opened. One can get to Tallaght, which is a great place, quite easily from the city centre by taking the Luas, which I was happy to support. One can enjoy all the facilities one would expect in a major town, such as council offices, a shopping centre, a hospital and an institute of technology. It has leisure facilities such as the National Basketball Arena and the Civic Theatre. There are many things to do in Tallaght &mdash; one can work, rest and play to one&rsquo;s <Col N="1964"/>heart&rsquo;s content there. That is why I spend so much time in Tallaght. I do not suggest that I hate coming to town because that would not be fair, but it is right that shopping and leisure facilities have been provided in an area such as Tallaght.</P>

	<P>Where is the one who does not love the land where he was born?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The growth of Tallaght has put great pressure on such facilities, however. As one comes into Tallaght on the Luas, one can see the 25 cranes which are being operated in the town centre.</P>
      <P>I am arguing, in the context of this legislation, that Tallaght needs more garda&iacute; because it has changed over the past 15 years. It was a different place two years ago and it will be different in five years. There is a strong case for a substantial increase in Garda manpower in Tallaght. I do not want to fight with anyone in the House because we are all entitled to argue that small Garda stations in little villages need increased manpower. I have no problem with such claims, which I support in a general way. In that context, I suggest that the strength of the Garda in Dublin South-West, specifically in Tallaght, needs to be examined. That is a reasonable point to make during a debate on this legislation. All Deputies have argued that increasing the visibility of garda&iacute; on the beat is the best way to deal with petty crime, such as vandalism, and to develop good relations between communities and the Garda.</P>
      <P>I visited the city centre last Saturday evening for the Skyfest fireworks display, which was a great event for Dublin. There had been some mayhem in the preceding two days so it was noticeable that there was an impressive physical Garda presence. Members of the force could be seen at every street corner and on every doorstep. I think people responded in a positive way to their presence. I was too busy on Sunday to read newspaper reports of the event, but I suspect there was no real trouble in Dublin on Saturday night, especially when compared to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</P>
      <P>The authorities should learn a clear lesson that putting garda&iacute; on the beat is the best way to make progress, in my constituency and elsewhere. I hope the Minister will take note of the need for additional garda&iacute; during the debate on community policing. He should consider that such a need exists in the major population centres as well as in rural areas. He should ensure that the new garda&iacute; who are being trained are not deployed behind desks or in squad cars. They should be deployed on the streets, where they can interact with people and engage with communities. That is important.</P>
      <P>Deputies who spoke about the development of the community policing model said that a great deal of good work is being done by many garda&iacute; in the communities. My local community is no different in that regard. I agree with those who spoke about the promotion of community garda&iacute;, <Col N="1965"/>which often happens on the basis of the interest they have shown in their work and the effective way in which they have done their job. I do not propose to prevent good garda&iacute; from being promoted, but it is reasonable to suggest that some provision be made in this regard. A Deputy proposed yesterday that a system should be put in place to ensure that a community garda who is doing an effective job, for example by looking after communities, making progress with the community policing concept and developing neighbourhood watch schemes, can continue in that role for at least two years after he or she is promoted. It is important that we make such a provision.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about a particularly good submission that was made to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. The letter in question was written by a woman from Tallaght, strangely enough, who represents a community group. She made the fairly reasonable point that when the Minister is establishing local committees with local representation, as agreed, it is important he understands that such committees should not be allowed to become mere talking shops. I hope that meaningful models will emerge from the debates on this legislation so that progress can be made in respect of community policing. Communities will not buy into the process if that is not done.</P>
      <P>I would have expressed my support for some of the provisions of the Bill if I had had enough time to do so. I look forward to continuing to follow the progress of the legislation. I will make submissions on it to the select committee that will examine it. I will read all the submissions received by the committee and I will listen to all the oral submissions made to the committee. I hope the House will appeal to community groups to continue to engage with the Oireachtas and to tell public representatives what they want in this regard. I expect the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take action on the basis of the points raised so that progress can be made. I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance and wish him a happy Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in congratulating the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on his decision to allow a Nigerian student to return to Ireland. I hope he will be equally enlightened when he reviews the case of a Nigerian family of three living in Millstreet, County Cork. The family would have been on the same aeroplane to Nigeria as the student had it not been for a last minute reprieve by the courts to allow another appeal to the Minister. I hope the Minister&rsquo;s latest decision is an indication of a more compassionate approach in this area.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party welcomes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, especially the new emphasis on community policing. As Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe said, our only problem is that the Bill does not go far enough in providing new and independent <Col N="1966"/>structures to ensure the Garda force which has served the nation well since the foundation of the State will continue to do so. Society is changing rapidly and garda&iacute; require training, structures and resources to meet the demands of challenging times. This is not to say the fundamentals must change. As Deputy Costello pointed out in the course of his contribution, every member of the Garda must know that his or her primary duty is to protect and help members of the public with unfailing patience, courtesy and good humour.</P>
      <P>As the founding party of the State, Fine Gael against all the odds established an unarmed police force whose members were rooted in and servants of the community. Without maintaining the basic principle implied in the force&rsquo;s establishment, it matters little how many garda&iacute; are deployed on the streets. Without community co-operation, policing will not work, which is why cracks are beginning to show in certain areas of Garda work. Originally, garda&iacute; were part and parcel of their communities. They lived locally and their children went to school and grew up in the community, which is why the State had a community Garda force long before the term was included in law enforcement and crime prevention terminology. Times have changed and most garda&iacute; want and are entitled to live outside the communities they serve.</P>
      <P>Work practices have changed and shift work and round-the-clock cover are required in most areas. It is in this context that I wish to concentrate in my contribution on community policing. I welcome the emphasis on community policing in the Bill and am confident the report being prepared by Deputy Costello for the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights will provide a sound basis for community policing in future. I suspect, however, that old attitudes will prevail. At a recent meeting of the joint committee, the Garda Commissioner said he could not properly deploy garda&iacute; if a dedicated community police force were established. The attitude is similar to the one adopted by the Government in the area of education.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that money provided for pre-school and primary school services is well spent. That intervention must take place when it is most necessary and effective is not only true from a social point of view, but in the context of the long-term benefits to the economy and taxpayers. Useful, efficient community policing will have the same beneficial effect on crime prevention. It will prevent problems from developing, thereby cutting back on the requirement to invest resources in remedial education, crime detection, court services, probation services and prisons. Given the Government&rsquo;s promise to provide a dedicated traffic corps, why can it not provide a dedicated community policing corps as part of the proposed restructuring of the Garda force?</P>
      <P>The nature of Garda training will become increasingly significant and specialisation will form an essential element of it. Special training is required for garda&iacute; providing immigration <Col N="1967"/>services. I have brought to the attention of the Minister previously the numerous complaints made about the treatment by immigration officers at airports and ports of immigrants, asylum seekers and tourists mistaken for asylum seekers or immigrants. The complaints have never been properly investigated because of the complexity of the complaints procedure. This is because immigration officers at our ports and airports are members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The Government must have recognised the need for a traffic corps given its promise to provide one in the lead up to two general elections. The training requirements for a member of a traffic corps, a community police officer or a garda investigating information technology offences or financial fraud must have completely different emphases. It has been suggested that Garda training should include attendance at a university or other third level institution at which personnel could specialise in one or two aspects of the profession. Such attendance would also have the advantage of broadening a recruit&rsquo;s horizons from an educational point of view.</P>
      <P>Without dedicated corps, the objectives of the Bill will not be achieved, especially in the area of community policing. Community policing has been the poor relation in Garda structures and is not seen by many garda&iacute; as real police work. The Garda authorities do not give it the priority it deserves and until now the Minister has failed to ring-fence resources for this most important function. To an extent, it is easy to understand why. From a career or political perspective, the results of reform in this area will only become apparent in the long term and the benefits will not be felt during the terms in office of the serving Minister or Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The facts demonstrate that community policing is working in only a few areas and any success is due solely to the few dedicated garda&iacute; on the ground who are committed to the concept. Recently, a retired Garda sergeant formerly in charge of community policing in the Bray-Shankill-Greystones area made a submission to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. He said that during his tenure and since, the powers that be have provided only lip-service to community policing which is underfunded, under-resourced and constitutes the Cinderella of Garda services. There are no proper structures in place and the committed people involved lack a career path. Community policing survives solely at the whim of various district officers.</P>
      <P>Community policing officers are classed as occupying dead-end jobs and have been told so when seeking promotion. The retired garda painted a picture of a completely under-resourced unit that lacked personnel and could not provide cover for more than eight hours per day. The unit had no access to staff to replace officers who were sick or on leave. Community garda&iacute; were constantly taken off community <Col N="1968"/>policing duty if there were shortages in other units. The submission was not isolated. A serving garda in Cork described to the joint committee her complete frustration at the inept manner in which community policing has been run. Instead of appointing suitably trained garda&iacute;, the Garda authorities seek to fill vacancies by asking garda&iacute; if they will take jobs in the short term. As outlined by the former Garda sergeant to whom I referred, the problem is that a community policing appointment is considered to be a dead-end position.</P>
      <P>Community policing garda&iacute; complain at the lack of training for the specialised work they undertake with juveniles, Travellers and, more and more, in the context of general integration. In another submission to the joint committee, a garda said senior garda&iacute; gave little credence to the concept of community policing and prioritised what they described as &ldquo;real police work&rdquo;. All community garda&iacute; in Cork are called on to perform regular policing duties as well as their community policing functions. Community garda&iacute; may be given to understand their work is unimportant, part-time and secondary. However, they perform cash escort duties, post office duties and duties at concerts and matches. Community garda&iacute; are required to submit details of their attendances at court and the number of drunk-driving and other summonses they issue. In effect, they undertake a role similar to that of a garda working in a regular Garda unit and are reprimanded if they are perceived to be inactive in the areas in which they have responsibility. To add insult to injury, one of the submissions includes the comment of a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a group of community garda&iacute; to the effect that community policy is an unaffordable luxury.</P>
      <P>Despite the good work done by the current Garda management in other areas, it clearly either does not appreciate the role of properly trained and resourced community garda&iacute; or simply does not have the resources to fund such a force. We are all to blame for this to some extent. The statistics which indicate the achievements of the Government, Minister and Garda Commissioner during their period of office are all important. However, we should focus on the statistical improvements that could be achieved over time by a properly resourced community police force.</P>
      <P>The sentiments in this Bill are correct. However, without at least a separate division, reporting to an assistant commissioner and with its own resources and budget, the Minister&rsquo;s good intentions will remain aspirational. The provision in Part 5 for the establishment of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate represents a useful tool for the Minister in the future. Had such a power been available to Ministers in the past, community policing might not be in its current deplorable state. However, notwithstanding this new power, it is clear that unless community policing is a sep<Col N="1969"/>arate corps with its own budget, one of the central planks of the legislation will be unworkable.</P>
      <P>Another element of the Bill which could sit comfortably within the community policing division is the establishment of a volunteer force. A well-trained and committed community police force could direct and assist in the training of a volunteer force. In suitable circumstances this concept could be extended to include a part-time element, through which the talents of retired garda&iacute;, civil servants, social workers and other highly qualified personnel could be utilised to back up community garda&iacute;. I am confident there are many such people prepared to participate as volunteers. Such a force must be under the jurisdiction of the Garda and proper training must be provided. The Minister has included safeguards in the legislation in this regard.</P>
      <P>Apart from making provision for a community volunteer force, the main function of this Bill in regard to community policing is the establishment of local structures or the modification of existing structures at local authority level. I do not envy the Minister&rsquo;s task in this respect and I agree that local authorities represent the best way forward. However, there must also be a substantial input from other organisations, especially community groups. Anyone familiar with local government knows the improvements to local governance that were introduced in recent years have largely failed.</P>
      <P>One must judge the success of local government on the general public&rsquo;s perception of the new bodies. Perhaps 10% of the population has a concept of the function of county development boards and even fewer understand the concept of expanded area committees. In general, the electorate is totally confused, bemused and over-taxed because of the plethora of agencies in existence. In most cases, the primary objective of such bodies is to build an empire and ensure their own survival.</P>
      <P>There are no defined areas at sub-county level or suburban divisions through which all organisations can work together. For example, different local areas are defined for the purposes of the operation of the HSE, the Leader programme, ADM, enterprise boards, Garda divisions and even the local area served by a number of Garda stations. The education system is structured through the differing areas of responsibility of VECs and community and private schools. Likewise, county councils perform their functions according to various definitions of housing areas, roads areas and so on.</P>
      <P>None of the areas defined by these various bodies is compatible with any other. To ensure the development of successful community policing, educational, health and other agencies must work together in a specifically defined local area to deal with the various problems that arise. In this context, the Minister should work with his counterpart in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to instruct county and city councils to clearly desig<Col N="1970"/>nate sub-county and suburban areas in which all agencies must focus their work. In this way, all bodies working with State money and resources can organise and pool their activity to the best benefit of the community. It is within such defined boundaries that community policy will work most effectively.</P>
      <P>I have advocated the creation of such divisions for a considerable time. They are not unlike the divisional district councils which the Progressive Democrats Party proposed some years ago. That party envisaged a corresponding abolition of the county councils. However, it is possible to have effective district councils operating within the existing county and city council structures. A new framework must be devised if intentions regarding the provision of community policing are to be realised.</P>
      <P>Whatever area divisions the Minister decides to use, it is important that all agencies co-operate closely. Flexibility is crucial in those counties such as Cork, for example, where there are different layers of local government including county council, city council and other administrative divisions. The system devised by the Minister must be capable of being adapted by county and city councils. The designation of defined areas or districts on which all agencies can focus is the preferable solution.</P>
      <P>The Bill suggests that members will be appointed to the police committees in accordance with the proportional strength of their parties at local government level. The legislation does not make clear whether, apart from the Garda representation, it is the Minister or members of the committee who will have the power to co-opt or appoint members from other agencies. Once the committees have been established, it should be the members and chairman, perhaps in consultation with an outside body, which appoints other members from the community, as in Northern Ireland. There is no doubt, judging from submissions to the committee, that a strong involvement by community groups is necessary. There are other issues that I do not have time to cover. However, generally speaking, Fine Gael welcomes the Bill. We will table amendments on Committee and Report Stages which reflect our policy as well as the submissions made to the joint committee. The amendments should not be seen as a basic criticism of the Bill, but rather as constructive proposals for what is worthwhile legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Any Bill that serves to clarify and tidy up a century of legislation, as this one does, should be welcomed. That this Bill lays down for the first time a definition of the functions and objectives of the national police force makes it imperative that it is passed. The Bill proposes to modernise the State&rsquo;s definition and working of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the force is in line with the 21st century and developments in modern policing. I emphasise, therefore, the benefits of the introduction of this legislation, <Col N="1971"/>providing as it does for joint policing committees and volunteer policing.</P>
      <P>We live in a modern democratic society that is policed by a system of mutual consent, as it should be. Public support and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system as a whole is critical if it is to operate in this way. This means that it is unhealthy for the police to become isolated from the community they are meant to serve because such distance invariably promotes mistrust and apathy and breeds a lack of confidence in a body which is intended to protect law-abiding citizens and prevent crime. Joint policing committees and volunteer policing will bring communities and the Garda into closer proximity, thereby enhancing confidence and feelings of security by allowing a greater sense of partnership and joint responsibility. Not alone will this boost community morale, since if relations are close-knit at local level, there is every reason to believe that anti-social behaviour will be discouraged.</P>
      <P>Six community policing forums have been experimented with in recent years in areas of Dublin, entailing monthly meetings at a Garda station between local police commanders, representatives of local and community-based organisations and local residents. The first to be established was in the north inner city, which borders my constituency. In a report published three years after its inception, major improvements were found to have occurred in relations between the community and State agencies, including the Garda. Moreover, it was found that almost three-quarters of the residents in that area were more willing to report drug related crime and 80% were more willing to report anti-social behaviour. This is clear evidence that the new style of policing can and will work. The report is entitled Community Policing and Drugs in Dublin: The North Inner City Community Policing Forum, prepared by Johnny Connolly in October 2002.</P>
      <P>Anti-social behaviour has become a key issue of concern in the press, but more importantly in neighbourhoods across Ireland. The basic fear of it not only impacts on people&rsquo;s lives, it can often blur the boundary between the perception of a crime epidemic and the reality of a situation. If people are actively involved in some level of policing, not alone can they feel reassured, they can help to spread this into the community by word of mouth and by increasing the visibility of law enforcement officers. People more often than not have pride in their local communities. This pride can be effectively streamed through a volunteer force to help tackle crime and work towards the betterment of the quality of life. On a logistical level, moreover, without any intention to replace them, a volunteer force would free up uniformed garda&iacute; and allow them to be re-employed more effectively, for example, at night time and during weekends when public order incidents are at their peak.</P><Col N="1972"/>
      <P>The involvement of local authorities in the system would also make tackling crime and its prevention more efficient by highlighting area-specific issues to the Garda and passing on local concerns. One corollary of this is local and neighbourhood renewal. The projects offer us a potential instrument for skill development in the community. This has been one aspect of the local strategic partnerships set up in parts of Great Britain as part of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. It is one that could be put to good use in this jurisdiction too. When we set up these joint committees and volunteer forces, however, we must be careful to ensure they are taken seriously at all levels and within all jurisdictions from the start. To function with effect, they must command the respect, not just of the people but of the garda&iacute; with whom they work. The response to any realisation of these forces must be one of respect and confidence and this must be reciprocated by both sides. Moreover, they must ensure inclusiveness within their operations and activities so that no minority groups become isolated from the projects and render their leading qualities worthless.</P>
      <P>Another aspect to the clarifying and modernising character of this Bill is the introduction of greater transparency and accountability in the methods and actions of the Garda. This is a welcome step and the proposed legislation ensures that neutrality and objectivity, the two key ingredients in the make-up of any such body, will prevail. This will also serve to boost public confidence in our security forces following recent high-profile cases which do not reflect the organisation as a whole but, sadly, have led to its being tainted in the eyes of a few. The Bill&rsquo;s contents overall will benefit the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the criminal justice system and society by bringing them closer together and further into line with the new century, a move that is long overdue.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what I said about confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, despite recent high-profile events, both in Donegal and at the May Day protests a few years ago. By and large, the majority of citizens have full confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the way it carries out its duties. Certainly, we as legislators have a responsibility to back up the force in its work and defend it. There were a few incidents but these must not be allowed to characterise the Garda as a whole and must not be used by people who, on the whole, oppose community forces. We cannot repeat often enough our confidence in the force while at the same time introducing new measures of reform which are needed as well as constantly monitoring the situation.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, and members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for the work they have done on key aspects of this Bill, for the submissions received on community policing and the meetings held with the various interested groups. This week several groups made presentations to the Oireachtas <Col N="1973"/>Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, including the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the local drugs task forces. Both organisations expressed concerns over the proposed anti-social behaviour orders as outlined in the Bill. These orders will allow local authorities and the Garda to summon offenders to court on a civil rather than a criminal basis. Both groups argue that this will undermine community policing and criminalise young people.</P>
      <P>It is important to listen to these concerns, particularly those from the local drugs task forces. The task force in the Dublin North-Central constituency, with which I am familiar, has first-hand experience of the situation. I am keeping an open mind on these proposed anti-social behaviour orders and am prepared to listen to the arguments for and against. New ideas and methods for dealing with the serious problem of anti-social behaviour are always welcome. While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a man of ideas, he is also one for delivering on them. I hope agreement can be reached on introducing measures such as these to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on the quality of debate at its annual conference this week. There is a recognition that change is needed in the Garda. It is a healthy sign that many new suggestions for changes were made, demonstrating that members of the Garda are serious about delivering good public service and have new ideas they wish to see implemented by the Minister and the Oireachtas. The association also made a submission to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. It wants a radical overhaul of community policing structures within the force in the interest of breaking down the perceived anti-police ethos in some sections of the community and improving relations with the public.</P>
      <P>When the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors makes such a statement, Members must take note. As public representatives we should wholeheartedly support the association&rsquo;s position. Community policing is vitally important on the ground but it has not been backed up in the past with either commitment or resources. The benefits of community policing have been well outlined. I hope that with this Bill serious consideration will be given to beefing up the community policing system and ensuring it operates effectively.</P>
      <P>The association outlined the need for an ethnic mix within the Garda, while maintaining standards. For various reasons, some ethnic groups may not meet the training qualifications as easily as Irish citizens. This is through no fault of theirs but due to language barriers, training and so forth. Members need to be conscious that as the make-up of Irish society is changing rapidly, State institutions and organisations must respond and serve these changes. The Garda is no exception. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1974"/>Reform has referred to the need for an ethnic mix in the force and is committed to it. Recent reports point to the fact that ethnic minorities will be with us in greater numbers in the years ahead. Garda policing methods will have to be up to speed in this regard.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s comments about garda&iacute; on the beat. All Members are calling for a more visible presence of the Garda. Deputy O&rsquo;Connor gave the example of the recent St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, at which the Garda was clearly visible, making a real difference in reassuring the public, giving further evidence of how important it is to have garda&iacute; on the beat.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Lord Mayor&rsquo;s commission on crime and policing believes reducing crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour should not be the sole responsibility of the Garda but shared among public bodies and communities. This recommendation is in line with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. The commission&rsquo;s worthwhile report highlights the frustrations of Dublin city communities and neighbourhoods with anti-social behaviour, disorder and low-level crime. The report points to a range of concerns from people leaving pubs at night, behaving in an aggressive and noisy manner, leaving pools of vomit and urine behind them to groups congregating in parks, on street corners and other public places to drink or take drugs. These are everyday occurrences in the life of our communities. The measures called for in the commission&rsquo;s report are catered for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The lack of consistency between geographical areas of Garda districts and local authority area committees was raised. Speaking from a Dublin perspective, I agree these do not coincide. This issue must be examined in the context of the new structures proposed in the Bill to see if greater co-ordination can be achieved. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the volunteer members of the Garda will not be a substitute for the recruitment of new garda&iacute;. It has allayed people&rsquo;s concerns about volunteer members.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the House. It is an exciting Bill and I believe it will make a huge difference in our community.</P>

I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, cad is fi&uacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo muna bhfuil na hacmhainn&iacute; ag teacht ina diaidh? T&aacute; m&eacute; buartha nach bhfuil na hacmhainn&iacute; ann chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
      <P>The Government is being reckless in expecting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a strength that is far lower than the proportionate rise in population would require, to operate effectively without commensurate additional resources. It is not just taking a risk but is creating the ingredients for huge problems. I see it happening already in my constituency. The pressure on parents to leave home early in the morning to seek employment to pay for the mortgage and child care not only means they are not at home and children are expected to remain out of trouble in the course of their latch-key upbringing but also that those housing estates do not have the passive supervision that existed in such estates in previous times when only one parent was forced by economic circumstances to work outside the home. Burglaries will be another inevitable consequence.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under increasing pressure. Although the Government will say there are more garda&iacute;, there are far more duties for those garda&iacute;. These include drugs related duties, public order duties, policing under age drinking and so forth. Will the Government support its debating and organisational strategy for the Garda with resources that are commensurate with the demographic changes that have taken place? I do not see that happening. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not see it because the figures do not add up even though the expectations of the Garda are constantly increasing.</P>
      <P>Some garda&iacute; are, understandably, suffering from low morale as a result of the pressures. Many of them are looking forward to early retirement if they can secure it, but that also creates the problem of vacancies arising which are left <Col N="1976"/>unfilled. However, there are, thank goodness, garda&iacute; who engage with the community, in many cases above and beyond the call of duty, although one would like to think it is their duty to do so. I work with the Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs group which runs, in co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, successful parent to parent courses. They are conducted on a voluntary basis by those involved but they facilitate a critical interaction between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, parents and the community.</P>
      <P>After seeing samples of confiscated illicit drugs, parents are in a position to recognise the substances when they unwittingly come upon them. A number of parents have approached me on this issue. They feel helpless when they belatedly discover that their children have been offered drugs or are getting caught up in a damaging, not to mention illegal, recreational pursuit. We commend the garda&iacute; who are providing that level of co-operation. Hopefully, they will be emulated by others and helped by additional resources.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey referred to the Lord Mayor of Dublin&rsquo;s commission on crime. I welcome that initiative. It has started a debate and ensured the community empathises more with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and plays a part in alleviating the problems and stress which give rise to crime. I pay tribute to my colleague, Councillor Bronwen Maher, and other colleagues on Dublin City Council who worked with the Lord Mayor in initiating that commission. I hope the recommendations made by the commission will be seriously considered. Ultimately, much of the expectation on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is related to its actions on the licensed trade and on late-night drinking in particular. In the town of Swords, there seems to be a deliberate policy to corral people into the licensed premises on the main street. The unseemly side of late-night drinking culture can therefore be contained and the Garda can concentrate their resources. This policy has a down side as it has a serious impact on the local community. This needs to be taken on board and I am glad the Minister gives much thought to this matter. I ask that further consideration be given to the communities that have to suffer the consequences of late-night drinking. They have to get up in the morning and provide economically for their families.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there has been some reaction against the habit-forming under age drinking promotions. Some spirits are being sold in small plastic bags and are not intended for social drinking as their producers might claim. A complaint has been upheld against that product. There are health and crime costs associated with not tackling under age drinking. In future years, Deputies will look back and ask why something more effective was not done about it. Hospitals are already bulging due to the effects of alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>The Garda need community support. They also need Government support. Such support can be given in resources. Organisational aid is welcome, <Col N="1977"/>but it will be a very small and meaningless part of the overall reform unless resources are provided. This is particularly the case in fast-growing areas like north Dublin, where the population has grown tenfold in some towns, yet the Garda strength seems to remain static. That cannot be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the new reforms and structure that have been put in place in this Bill. I particularly welcome the new fully independent Garda ombudsman commission, which will operate in favour of the public and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This new mechanism is urgently needed to ensure honesty and to highlight any complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There should be strong emphasis on the need for a fair and effective complaints system to ensure that the police are held accountable if they infringe the rights of citizens. This system must guarantee a fair hearing for the complainant and the accused officer and must provide a firm basis for public confidence in the police force.</P>
      <P>While the Bill offers some welcome reforms, I hope it offers fully effective protection for civil liberties. There have been public complaints about a number of incidents involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent times. A genuinely independent investigator will, I hope, provide us with the adequate safeguards and restore the shaky confidence of the public.</P>
      <P>The level of policing is a vital concern to us all. I call on the Minister to put in place the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; promised in the last election. If there was an increased number of garda&iacute;, as promised, then we could be assured of the best police service and Irish towns would not suffer from so much vandalism. The Garda is doing all it can to police our streets, but there are simply not enough garda&iacute; on the beat at night. The Government is to blame for this. More garda&iacute; are needed on the streets and more action needs to be taken against those who perpetrate crime on businesses and elderly people. More resources should be given to garda&iacute; to combat the violence they face. They need assistance to deal with issues like running battles, assault and abuse, as they try to do their duty and restore the peace. Cases remain unreported and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unable to justify the urgent resources needed to reduce crime.</P>
      <P>In my own town of Ennis, the Garda works closely with the president of the chamber of commerce. A joint working accord has been formed to deal with the increased levels of petty crime, harassment and begging which affect businesses, residences and visitors. This highlights the urgent need for prudent measures for more garda&iacute; on the streets in the towns and villages in County Clare. We need more garda&iacute; to target violence, drugs and crime so that public trust and confidence can be restored. Justice is here to protect citizens in their homes, businesses and communities. If the Government does not ensure justice by putting its promises into action, to whom can <Col N="1978"/>the people turn for a safe society? I call on the Minister to address this situation and I demand the 2,000 garda&iacute; that have been promised. The people are entitled to safety.</P>
      <P>I place on record my appreciation for the Garda and the work it carries out, often with limited resources. I also declare my thanks and appreciation to a superintendent in Clare who is soon to retire. Se&aacute;n Corcoran was an ambassador when he went abroad with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He was held in high esteem throughout County Clare and among garda&iacute; in general. The people of Clare and Ireland are thankful to this garda for a job well done.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhu&iacute;och as ucht an seans labhairt ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, for his openness on this Bill. He has welcomed many contributions on this debate from people in the Seanad and from a number of statutory organisations. The debate has been very enlightening so far and we can all contribute to the most radical legislation that has come before the House in years. I also commend his Ministers of State, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Fahey, as well the staff in the Department. I have no doubt the Minister will remain open-minded when recommendations and amendments come before him in later stages of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I commend Commissioner Conroy and his staff on the work they do on our behalf. We must recognise the work that nobody sees but which is undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes the gathering of intelligence and quiet but effective work against the illegal drugs trade and other gangland crime. Not all such work is reported because of its very nature but I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its endeavours. We can see how efficient the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in a crisis. In recent months, murders in Cork and elsewhere were acted upon effectively by members of the force. I commend the manner in which they worked, by bringing local communities with them in the search for missing persons, although I do not wish to comment on individual cases.</P>
      <P>While we have a very efficient Garda force, the Bill aims to promote effective relations between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government, the Minister, local authorities and the community at large. I acknowledge that there is already a good working relationship in this regard. One only has to attend meetings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to witness the open relationship that exists between the Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That relationship is to be commended. Nevertheless, gaps have been recognised and the Bill will go a long way towards addressing them.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must work to maintain public confidence. Members of the public may be slow to express their confidence in the force but it is important to highlight the respect the public <Col N="1979"/>has in this regard. That will happen as a result of the joint policing committees that will eventually be established under the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes that have already come about due to the openness of the Minister&rsquo;s attitude, the debate in the Seanad and the redefining of the roles of the Minister and the Government. Transparency is required concerning the relationship between the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. When the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights dealt with the Barron report, former Ministers for Justice were asked about their exact roles <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In the investigations following the bombings in Dublin, Monaghan and other places, communications between the Minister of the day and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appear to have been somewhat deficient. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was investigating these atrocities but it was apparent to the committee that the ministerial and Garda roles were not clearly defined. The Minister of the day seemed to be far removed from the workings of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>Following those bombings, the Garda investigations were often wound down quickly but there was no clear explanation for why this happened. The Minister was not particularly involved and no doubt there were other pressures on him to get on with managing the affairs of State, although the North of Ireland conflict was a particularly sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill will clearly establish the working relationship between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. They will work closely together, but as independent entities, for the betterment of policing generally.</P>
      <P>We have a unique situation in so far as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the sole police force here, unlike other European countries. The Bill goes quite a way towards addressing the particular needs of that security force. The proposed significant involvement of members of local authorities and the public is to be welcomed. They will be called upon to act, as they currently do in an unofficial capacity. Their role will be given a clearer statutory basis once the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>Many local authorities are already working in this way with the co-operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I speak as a former member of Nenagh Town Council where local authority members meet with local garda&iacute; under the direction of Superintendent Jim Fitzgerald. To the best of their abilities, they address the various crime problems in the area. This open working relationship has proved to be quite effective, albeit in a limited way.</P>
      <P>The proposed introduction of joint policing committees is currently a matter of wide-ranging debate at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. I welcome the fact that Members of the Oireachtas will play their part despite yesterday&rsquo;s contribution by the General Council of County <Col N="1980"/>Councils, which was emphatic that it did not want Deputies or Senators on the joint policing committees. We also have a role to play, however. Confining meetings of such committees to Mondays and Fridays should not be a deterrent to keeping Oireachtas Members on joint policing committees.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s willingness to take on board the need for representation from town councils. We must recognise that crime is more apparent in urban settings, so it would be a serious omission if town councils were not represented on joint policing committees. I see them playing a leading role on such committees in future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello, myself and other members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights have listened intently to representations on this issue from the various local authority members&rsquo; organisations, such as LAMA, the General Council of County Councils and the AMAI. Emphasis has been placed on restricting membership of the joint policing committees to elected representatives, both at national and local level, and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There is merit in this argument because, after all, various community interests are already represented by those who have gone before the people and have been elected. No doubt there will be conflicts of opinion in that regard but I believe that formula is possibly the best one that has come before us. The involvement of those fora will integrate the various voluntary organisations and representative groups that have an interest in local area policing.</P>
      <P>Great work can be achieved by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities in preparing town and county development plans. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have a direct advisory role in issues such as public lighting, estate management and estate layout, thus helping to create a safer environment, particularly for vulnerable people, including the elderly and others living alone. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s move in this regard, which will mean that much useful work can be done. Ironically, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has accorded great recognition to the integrity of local public representatives who are elected by the people.</P>
      <P>The introduction of volunteer members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an interesting concept which arises in the Bill. The Minister is actively considering UK models where a reserve police force works in a training capacity with the established constabulary. I look forward to learning more about this idea in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is essential that adequate training be provided for those working on the new joint policing committees and related fora. The issues of confidentiality and adequate training were queried yesterday at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. Examples were cited from Northern Ireland, where training models are already in place. We <Col N="1981"/>may look to them for such training but it is essential that people should be clear about their roles on policing committees and the voluntary fora that will provide the necessary information to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities to work together.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the Garda ombudsman commission is included in the Bill. The existing Garda Complaints Board, due to its limited capacity, needs to be revised and reformed and I am glad the opportunity for this arises in the Bill. The issue of complaints about members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be made clearer. Members of the public may have a complaint to make against a garda but would not know how to do so. I particularly welcome the significant development in the Bill that the new body will not always require the catalyst of a public complaint before it can investigate a case. However, we must acknowledge the powers of individual members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the people in uniform. To be fair, anyone who holds a position of power is in a position to abuse it. We must recognise this and enable and encourage garda&iacute; to maintain a high level of integrity and ensure their behaviour is ethical at all times.</P>
      <P>It is beyond doubt that past and more recent actions by some garda&iacute; would call their integrity into question. For example, I am aware of situations in which garda&iacute; working in different communities inherited significant property on the death of residents. Such garda&iacute; may with the best of intentions have acted to protect vulnerable or elderly people living on their own and been willed the property following their deaths to the devastation of some families. While it is difficult to know how such matters can be investigated, I hope the ombudsman commission will conduct investigations. Bequests may be due to the kindness and genuine efforts of the garda&iacute; involved but it is undoubted they can call into question their integrity and credibility as effective, ethical members of the police force. At present, such matters would be difficult to investigate but the appointment of the ombudsman commission will go far towards addressing the issue.</P>
      <P>The ombudsman commission will be appointed to serve the people and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for greater effectiveness and the betterment of the wider community. However, what happens if a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a complaint about another member of the force? For example, a member of more senior rank may subject a garda to bullying or other unacceptable behaviour. There is no provision in regard to the ombudsman commission for Garda members who wish to make a complaint about other garda&iacute; who act in an irresponsible or unacceptable way. Garda&iacute; may feel isolated or inadequately equipped to make a complaint. The Minister should seriously consider this as an issue that might opportunely be addressed in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the anti-social behaviour order recently indicated by the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1982"/>McDowell, which I hope he will implement. The behaviour of the young is a gap that has not been addressed and elderly people living on housing estates, for example, can feel vulnerable due to egg-throwing and other kinds of anti-social behaviour while garda&iacute; feel helpless. The issue will be addressed by the new order of the Minister. While the Irish Council for Civil Liberties expressed deep concern about the measure, legislation must be put in place so that young people experience fear. Many of the young have no idea of fear and dread nothing. They must experience some fear as a deterrent so others can live with the regular quality of life they were accustomed to but which diminished because of out of control and anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent development by the Department, working with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to attempt to upgrade Garda vehicles, a long-standing request of the Garda Representative Association. Great strides have been made in this regard. The Minister has heard me speak of this matter on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited Nenagh on one occasion and got a classic example of what can go wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Ms Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Nenagh is always to the fore of the Minister&rsquo;s mind when he examines upgrading for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of additional garda&iacute;, a matter on which the Minister has acted in good time. He did not wait for construction to take place at Templemore before training the garda&iacute;. I welcome that construction of the four-storey block in Templemore is well under way and that the Minister has provided accommodation for garda&iacute; in nearby Nenagh while training is ongoing. The Minister is also working to ensure an adequate number of the additional 2,000 garda&iacute; will go to rural areas outside Dublin. The Minister recently acknowledged at a committee meeting that growing areas of population outside Dublin have a minimal number of garda&iacute; who do their best but struggle with the limited staff available to address anti-social problems and larger issues of crime. The Minister should adequately provide rural areas with garda&iacute; trained at Templemore and open additional Garda stations.</P>
      <P>T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och as ucht an seans labhairt ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo inniu. T&aacute;im ag s&uacute;il le n&iacute;os m&oacute; oibre ar an reachta&iacute;ocht agus t&aacute;im ag brath ar na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would welcome further submissions from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome to Leinster House the deputation from the Nenagh community reparation project, the unique project which I hope will eventually become a statutory body. It has worked successfully on the area of reparation and involving the community with local justice issues. It serves not to replace the judicial system but to work with it by making people accountable and responsible for their misdemeanours and offences, and when <Col N="1983"/>they return eventually to court, with the assistance of the community panel, to see that their contract has been fulfilled. The deputation will attend the community policing hearings at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Law Reform this afternoon. I look forward to the expansion of this project as a model for other areas to adapt.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate. I welcome further work on the Bill, in which I am particularly interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I congratulate the Minister and his officials for putting it together and others for making submissions on it. It is an important, timely and complex document which reflects the multifaceted, complex and demanding role the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays in our modern society. I am constantly pleased to see garda&iacute; involved in many different functions. We as citizens greatly depend on them to protect and assist when emergencies and accidents occur. In the main, garda&iacute; are talented and dedicated people. This Bill serves to modernise the legislation under which they work and to protect both them and citizens from possible abuses, to modernise the complaints procedures and so forth.</P>
      <P>I will make some technical points about the Bill and draw attention to some minor issues initially. Section 7 notes that &ldquo;In performing its functions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights.&rdquo; Section 16 also notes that the garda&iacute; should be aware of their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights but that convention is not mentioned in the Bill and I am not sure that the explanatory memorandum carries any weight or what is meant by human rights, which are not mentioned in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 16 speaks of a code of ethics, which is important. The section mentions a number of bodies to be consulted about establishing a code of ethics. The Minister might consider including the National Disability Authority among those bodies. It might well have a role to play in the drawing up of a code of ethics. It is good that the reference to the code is there.</P>
      <P>Section 22 has been the subject of much debate. Concern might be too strong a word, but I note the Minister may issue written directives concerning any matter relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These directives will be laid before the House and the Minister is accountable to the House. However, in terms of the future, I would like more information about these directives. If, as is stated in the Bill, the directives can relate to any matter regarding policing, I would be concerned that we might be giving future Ministers too much power and freedom. We have to be careful in the area of policing in particular that we do not do so and that there are checks and balances. The Minister might give us some more information on this issue.</P><Col N="1984"/>
      <P>Section 32(5) is of interest. It says that a statement &ldquo;made in any form and without malice by a member of the committee or subcommittee or by a person attending the meeting at the request of the committee or subcommittee is privileged for purposes of the law of defamation and so is any subsequent publication of the statement.&rdquo; We in this House have privilege.</P>

	<P>The section refers to the law on defamation. Is there any redress if someone makes a statement? Members of the public have redress in that they can complain to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but in this case I am not sure if any such redress is possible. I am not a solicitor or barrister but reading this from a layman&rsquo;s point of view, it appears that someone could possibly make a statement and not have it challenged. Are there procedures built in so such a statement could be withdrawn or challenged, or to allow for a person to ask for redress if the statement was later proven wrong? This point might be worth considering on Committee Stage. It is important that we ensure there are no abuses or, if there are abuses, that people have a means of seeking redress.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets up the ombudsman&rsquo;s commission, which is important. There are three members on it. I know there has been much debate about whether there should be one or three members. What happens if there are three members and two agree on a decision while the other disagrees? Does majority rule or must the decision be unanimous? That is not clear in the Bill. Could that lead to difficulties at a later stage? Is there a chairman of the commission or are all three members equal? How are their meetings to be convened and run?</P>
      <P>Over my years in this House we have had chairpersons of such bodies who have certain responsibilities and roles to play in convening and so forth. That does not seem to be the case in this instance. I would like that matter clarified because it is not clarified in the Bill. Does the commission have to act as a unanimous body or can two members of it take a majority decision? That needs to be clarified.</P>
      <P>The removal of members of the commission is mentioned. They can be removed for stated misbehaviour but it does not say in the Bill what such behaviour is, who decides what it is, how or by whom it is to be adjudicated. Would someone have to be brought before a court of law and found guilty of stated misbehaviour? Who states what the stated misbehaviour is? Where is it stated? All this may be in the Bill but I have not seen it.</P>
      <P>Section 58 speaks of certain types of people debarred from being members of the ombudsman commission. However, it does not say that a person with a criminal record cannot be a member. It might be useful to insert that provision. It may <Col N="1985"/>not be the right thing to do but we have inserted that provision in other instances.</P>
      <P>The other interesting bodies being established are the joint policing committees. Going by my first reading, the mechanism for setting these up is a little woolly. My colleague asked earlier if the town councils, no matter how large or small, were to be included. I believe they should be, in some way or other. It is not made clear if it is just county and city councils which will be involved. These committees also run the risk of being very big, which worries me.</P>
      <P>There has been a debate about the role of Members of the Oireachtas. All Members of the Oireachtas in the particular area should be <i>ex officio</i> members of the committee. That might be a way of dealing with the matter. I agree with what many Deputies said. Members of the Oireachtas are being shoved aside and excluded from many areas, which is wrong. We have a mandate. We are elected to speak in this House, which is linked with many bodies in the State. If it is the case that an Oireachtas Member in an area is a &ldquo;member of&rdquo;, that means the others are excluded. There may be a way of solving this issue with an<i> ex officio</i> mechanism.</P>
      <P>The local Garda inspector or superintendent has an important role to play in interacting with the local authority, whatever it might be, but particularly with town councils. It is in urban areas that we have many difficulties with anti-social behaviour and so on. It is not clear in the Bill if the local authority could invite the Garda superintendent or authorities to meet it. That would be important. I am not saying the local Garda superintendent would be summoned before the council. That would be a bit strong, but perhaps the local authorities might invite the Garda superintendent or inspector to discuss a particular issue. A series of anti-social issues might, for example, be building up in a town and the local authority might feel it important that the local Garda superintendent be invited to discuss the matter before it. We need to introduce that more formal type of arrangement because it gives people a voice through their elected members at local level to interact with garda&iacute; on general policing policy. This more formal interaction happens in other countries where local police chiefs work with and come before city councils. There is another role for joint policing committees where members of community groups, voluntary organisations etc. can interact with garda&iacute; in a more informal capacity.</P>
      <P>There are perhaps two roles for the committees. My understanding of the Bill is that the joint policing committees as envisaged bring these roles together as one. We need to separate them. We should have formal interaction with the local authority and a more informal working relationship with local communities, including members of the local authority.</P>
      <P>In some areas there is an anti-Garda ethos and one of today&rsquo;s newspapers reported on that. Previously I worked as a teacher in a school where <Col N="1986"/>we used invite members of the Garda into the classroom. They came in, often dressed informally, interacted with the young teenagers and answered their questions. Their visits were important because they bridged the gap between the formal garda and the young citizen. A particular result of these visits was that a young girl rang the Garda station to speak to the female garda who had visited the classroom. This girl was being accosted inappropriately on her way home in the evenings. As a result of having met the garda informally in the classroom, the girl felt she could ask to speak to her and have the problem dealt with, and it was dealt with in a professional manner. This sort of relationship must be developed between garda&iacute; and our young people.</P>
      <P>Section 29 deals with the importance of the Irish language. To my shame I am not fluent in Irish. I wonder whether the Official Languages Act applies where a person goes into a Garda station and wants to conduct his or her business as Gaeilge. A question struck me when the Bill was passing through the House; if a person is arrested, is the arresting garda obliged to caution him or her as Gaeilge as well as as B&eacute;arla? I am not sure about that. If a person wants to interact with garda&iacute; as Gaeilge, has he or she a right in that regard? If the garda did not have competency in Irish, would there be a difficulty? We could tie ourselves up in knots and red tape, but this is the time to raise these issues and tease them out.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hoctor that it is important that there is adequate training for members of the joint policing committees. We need more debate and clarity on the issue of volunteers. The volunteers will have the same powers and role as garda&iacute;, but I am not sure whether they will have the same training as garda&iacute;. How will they deal with cases where they must go before a court to give evidence or where they have to arrest people? How will these volunteers be recruited? The word &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; implies they will not be paid, but they will probably have expenses of some sort. Will these issues be teased out? Will the volunteers have Garda uniforms?</P>
      <P>I raise these issues on account of my experience in An F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, the reserve army. That force did not have anything like the interaction with the public that these volunteers will have. It is important, however, to ensure when people are put in uniform they are properly trained and resourced and that they have proper back-up. Their role must be thought out fully. If they are to have the same role as garda&iacute;, they must be subject to the same restrictions and responsibilities. The Bill indicates these volunteers will not be community police as such, a different concept. They will be volunteers who will form a reserve police force. Will they be paid when they go on duty?</P>
      <P>The Bill also addresses the issues of the inspectorate and the ombudsman commission. There has been much debate on this. I agree there is a need for both roles. If there is a conflict between <Col N="1987"/>the inspectorate and the commission, which will have supremacy? If, for example, the inspectorate says garda&iacute; may use a certain procedure, but the commission finds human rights will be affected by that procedure, who will adjudicate on the issue? This matter must be clarified as it is not clear in the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of being helpful and making these general points. Section 38 provides for the annual report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be brought forward. I understand that it will be laid before the House five months after the year ends. That time should be reduced to maintain confidence. There is much good in this welcome Bill, yet it is important to have debate on it. The ombudsman commission is a good and welcome idea. It is important that citizens are made aware of the commission, its role and authority so that they know how to proceed if they want to make a complaint. I wish the Minister and the Bill well and look forward to further debate on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael welcomes this important Bill but has some questions and concerns. A particular concern is the role of the Accounting Officer. The Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer, but under this Bill it will be the Garda Commissioner. Value for money is important, as I know from my experience as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. The difficulty for Mr. Dalton was that he had so many different areas of responsibility and it was difficult to deal responsibly with Garda expenditure when he was not the person wholly accountable.</P>
      <P>The remit of accounting for the significant expenditure within the Garda and ensuring we get effective value for money is a most important responsibility for the Garda Commissioner, not alone from the point of view of services and the pay element, but from the point of view of investment in Garda stations and cars and the critical investments needed for victims of crime and other associated costs. In essence the Garda Commissioner must be concerned with value for the taxpayer. He will no doubt focus on getting the proper methodology in place in his office so that there will be total accountability with regard to the expenditure of taxpayers&rsquo; money in the delivery of an effective service throughout the State. This is something that is very much needed. It was very much lacking within the Department because the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s responsibilities are so wide and include the Prison Service, child care and so on. The Accounting Officer will deal solely with the Garda and this will be ring-fenced. The accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accounting Officer will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides for the appointment of volunteer members to the force but it is vague and ambiguous. However, the Minister recently <Col N="1988"/>announced that the volunteer force will comprise 1,400 members and, more significantly, while the volunteers will not receive the same two-year training course as members of the Garda, they will have the same powers. This is extraordinary. While I support the creation of such a force, volunteers should not have the same powers, given the responsibilities involved. The standard of training and qualifications of garda&iacute; in Templemore is high. For example, volunteers will be expected to prepare files for court and to be well versed in the cases to obtain prosecutions. Will the Minister explain his thinking in this regard?</P>
      <P>The recruitment of volunteers will be difficult. I am the chairman of a voluntary company which deals with people on F&Aacute;S schemes. It is extremely difficult to get people to participate in such schemes, even though they are paid to do so. However, volunteers will be expected to take on a dangerous job without payment. It is hard to believe people will volunteer, unless significant expenses are offered. This does not stack up.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has missed a significant opportunity. Up to 3,000 garda&iacute; have retired in recent years having reached the age of 50 and served in the force for 30 years. They could have served until they were 57 years. They are entitled to a gratuity, which they do not receive until they reach 57 years, but the Minister could pay them after 30 years service and then re-employ them on seven-year contracts. Experience cannot be beaten. If these retired garda&iacute; could access their gratuities, the Garda could re-invest in their experience and re-employ them. This, in turn, would free younger garda&iacute; from desk work to go on the beat. The retired garda&iacute; could man stations on day shift contracts and do much of the clerical work, given their vast expertise. It is not too late to do this and the Minister should examine this issue. These garda&iacute; could be given a special rank and a long service increment.</P>
      <P>Garda confidentiality is also an issue. How will volunteers be screened to ensure the confidentiality of Garda operations, the PULSE system and so on? The proposal on the volunteer force has not been fully thought out. Only a few masochists would volunteer to do a dangerous job and work with the Garda and the legal profession. Perhaps I will be proved incorrect. However, the Minister has lost an opportunity to hire experienced personnel who leave the force when they are 50 and who usually take up jobs with security firms and so on.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that a number of sections in the Bill will turn the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform into the chief of police. He or she will have a substantial role in directing the Garda. All substantive aspects of policing matters must, first, be approved by the Minister. For example, the Minister may set Garda priorities under section 19; the Garda strategy statement must be submitted to him or her for approval under section 20; the annual policing plan must be submitted to the Minister for approval; and, perhaps, most significantly, the Minister can issue <Col N="1989"/>directives to the Garda under section 22. The Minister is giving his successors significant powers. Will his desire to control the Garda be matched by a willingness to reply to parliamentary questions about the force when the Bill is enacted? That is a critical issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If an independent police authority was in place, I would not have to reply to any question.</P>

	<P>We are aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>When we table questions to the Minister regarding the Garda, we are informed that is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, not the Minister, but the Commissioner is not answerable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has responsibility for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be most welcome if the Minister gave a commitment to reply to parliamentary questions on the Garda when the legislation is enacted.</P>
      <P>Sections 30 to 34, inclusive, provide for the first time a statutory basis for the involvement of local authorities in policing matters. Interaction between local authorities and the Garda is long overdue. It is a welcome measure, which Fine Gael has advocated for some time. Garda superintendents will meet local authority officials and this is the most welcome provision in the legislation. Garda superintendents, who are all-powerful in their districts, will have a statutory duty to meet local authority officials and public representatives to discuss road safety, policing, anti-social behaviour and licensing laws.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>If communities are to experience long-term reductions in crime, local authorities must take on a dedicated oversight role in policing matters. I hope the Minister has discussed this with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish how effective local authorities could be in taking on this role. It is important that local authorities should promote the local policing boards upon their establishment. Providing a forum for garda&iacute; and local authorities to exchange views and co-ordinate their activities will bring real benefits to local communities. It will certainly provide an opportunity for interaction and give a sense of ownership to a public that is fast becoming disenchanted with our criminal justice system. Interaction between garda&iacute; and communities must be brought down to a more local level.</P>
      <P>An enormous amount of legislation has been enacted in these Houses in recent years and the difficulty is to implement it effectively. The biggest difficulty is that there are too few garda&iacute; on the beat. With the three-shift system, on any given day in Sligo alone there might be only ten garda&iacute; on duty out of perhaps 100 due to time off, holidays and so on. That is a major problem.</P><Col N="1990"/>
      <P>The Minister lost a huge opportunity with the volunteer system. It is not too late for him to examine the possibility of re-employing garda&iacute; at the age of 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no reason there would not be volunteer members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not work for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a unique concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like every other common law country such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot compare Ireland to a country like New Zealand. The economies of scale are completely different. Policing here is completely different. I do not know how the Minister can make any comparison with other jurisdictions when it comes to policing. If he expects a member to return to the force as a volunteer, having retired at 50 after 30 years&rsquo; service, he is not living in the real world. I cannot see that happening. It may be possible to re-employ them under a different contract but they will not return unless the Minister clearly indicates the type of contract they will be offered, such as day shifts or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They would all retire at 50 if that were the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister sounds deeply suspicious, almost paranoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has lost 3,000 of the most experienced Garda members in the past three to four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at the age of 50 having given 30 years&rsquo; service. If he were to indicate that they could tap into their gratuity, that would be welcome because those members are a huge loss. They are just waiting for an offer from the Minister. If they got a gratuity cheque and were employed on day shifts, I am certain they would return.</P>
      <P>The annual report for 2003 was published towards the end of 2004. It took almost one year for the Garda to compile its annual report. With that level of inefficiency we will not see the publication of the 2004 annual report until next Christmas.</P>
      <P>With regard to accountability, I am delighted the Minister is now seeing the type of accountability we experience in the Committee of Public Accounts regarding the responsibility of the Accounting Officer. There should be accountability in every Garda district in terms of the way funding is spent and the level of service provided.</P>
      <P>On the inadequate Garda facilities, the garda&iacute; are using third-rate vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1991"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>They are provided with commercial vehicles instead of specially manufactured patrol cars with the emphasis on security. Garda&iacute; are chasing criminals driving cars with turbo-charged engines in a vehicle with a 1.6 litre engine. They are not at the races at all in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 38 requires the Garda to publish its annual report four months after the year end. That would be a vast improvement and I hope it happens.</P>
      <P>On the question of the volunteer members, I hope it will not be like &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s Army&rdquo; because the way it is being framed it is almost like an imaginary plan. People looking for financial gain will not volunteer to take up a high-risk job. Trainee garda&iacute;, having spent only two years in Templemore, are being put into uniform without much training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a new concept. A free-standing volunteer force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps such systems operate effectively in New Zealand and Australia. I will have to investigate that matter further.</P>
      <P>The Garda Complaints Board has been the focus of consistent criticism for some time. It does not have the confidence of the public. We welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to dissolve the Garda Complaints Board and opt for the ombudsman model, which we have advocated for some time. The ombudsman commission will comprise three persons to be appointed by the D&aacute;il. Why has the Minister departed from the good precedent set in Northern Ireland where one ombudsman was favoured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ombudswoman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome the power given to the ombudsman in section 94(4) to initiate an investigation.</P>
      <P>Section 66 appears to envisage a need for garda&iacute; to provide special assistance to the ombudsman commission but is it not damaging to the independence of the ombudsman commission if members of the Garda are brought in to investigate other garda&iacute;? If persons of particular expertise are required, why can they not be from the UK, Canada, France or elsewhere?</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome, although it has many shortcomings. The sections about which I am concerned are those on the Garda volunteer force and the additional powers to the Minister. I welcome the local authority involvement. I am concerned that when Garda stations are to be searched the ombudsman must notify them prior to their investigation. If one were to have a hygiene audit, there would be little point in giving notice that it would take place the next day.</P><Col N="1992"/>
      <P>We welcome the last-minute decision to amend the Bill to provide for the Garda inspectorate. One reservation we have is that the inspectorate could have been established as part of the ombudsman&rsquo;s commission rather than as a separate body. It is extraordinary that we will have the appointment of an inspectorate and an ombudsman&rsquo;s commission when we could have had the one office.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on the Bill. It is vital that we reassure and involve the public. I hope the local authority involvement is not just lip service and that citizens of the State will be involved in the important consultation that will take place with residents, local authority representatives and politicians in their own areas to discuss the important issue of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and make some general points on the improvement needed in the services and the security provided by garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the administrative role mentioned in the context of the Bill and I compliment the Minister introducing the Bill on the amount of legislation he is bringing before the D&aacute;il for approval. While every Bill assists in the administration of the State, this Bill will touch the lives not only of the garda&iacute; but the people with whom they engage on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The Bill is timely because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an organisation, has to be modernised, better resourced and given the opportunity to engage in a positive way with the communities within which it works. It has to be resourced in a way that allows it to be a step ahead of those involved in criminal activity. At the same time, it has to be in a position to reach out to communities to assist them in their endeavours, thereby ensuring that the people it represents can live in a safe place in comfort and dignity.</P>
      <P>I would like to discuss the response of the Garda to the problems faced by the elderly in our communities. The biggest change I can remember in my local Garda station in County Kilkenny was the appointment of a F&Aacute;S worker to answer telephones. After that person was appointed, telephones were answered on time and complaints were logged and, presumably, passed on thereafter. The worker answering the telephone engaged with the person making the call. When one contacts a Garda station, one often gets the feeling that not enough people are on duty and those who are on duty cannot deal with all the aspects of that station&rsquo;s administration. One often wonders whether there is a need for urgent and immediate change.</P>
      <P>I would like local Garda stations to be better resourced so they can employ civilians to conduct administrative functions, thereby allowing those who are trained in dealing with society to get back on the streets. It would mean that the number of garda&iacute; on the beat could be increased and more people could deal with community issues. I am glad that this Bill relates to admin<Col N="1993"/>istration and engagement with local authorities and local groups.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>The community watch and community alert schemes which were promoted in the past were more relevant to an era that has passed. We are living in a different society that has moved on considerably. We no longer pursue a policy of closing Garda stations in rural communities because we understand that such stations are needed in growing communities. There was a time when one could count on the fingers of one hand the number of houses in some villages in County Kilkenny, but estates of more than 100 houses are now being built in such villages. We need to increase the policing service being provided in areas where Garda stations were closed some years ago so that they can benefit from some Garda presence in the interests of law and order.</P>
      <P>As urban centres have grown throughout the country, problems such as anti-social behaviour, drug and alcohol abuse and general criminality have increased in tandem. As a representative of a rural constituency, I think there has been a phenomenal growth in such problems in recent years. The efforts being made to combat such crime are not succeeding, much to the frustration of local communities. I assume the complaints made to public representatives are also made to the garda&iacute; working in such communities, but such matters are not being resolved.</P>
      <P>It seems that community garda&iacute; are often transferred as they are about to get fully engaged with local communities. It may take some time for a community garda to find out who the culprits are, to determine the best way of tackling such people, ascertain which families should be targeted and access the supports which are needed. Just as they are becoming familiar with such matters, they are moved to another community or another Garda station. Those involved in police administration should understand the importance of basing young garda&iacute;, in particular, in certain locations for a sufficient length of time. There is a need for such garda&iacute; to be allowed to do their jobs in local communities in the way they should be done. I hope this Bill will bring about such a change.</P>
      <P>I have said in this House during debates on other Bills that it is pointless to introduce legislative provisions without also providing the necessary funds. That is what it boils down to. If one does not have a sufficient number of garda&iacute; and the appropriate level of facilities &mdash; a Deputy mentioned the need for fast Garda cars &mdash; we will be trying to combat crime from the back foot. That is what is happening in areas where such resources have not been put in place. People in the community are being pestered as a result. Elderly people, for example, expect somebody to call to the door after they telephone a Garda station, but they feel vulnerable when that does not happen.</P><Col N="1994"/>
      <P>When a man was shot in Dublin recently while driving a truck, there was an inadequate response from the Garda after the complaint was made. I do not wish to blame the Garda, or to pass the buck, because it simply does not have enough resources. We have to take responsibility for that in the House. The Garda has served the State well throughout its history. It is doing an excellent job, but it could do much better if its structures and its level of funding were much different.</P>
      <P>Many complaints are made each year about individual garda&iacute; and about the handling of individual cases. Frustrated constituents have made serious complaints to me about the handling of particular cases. In some instances, they do not complain about the manner in which the authorities responded to their complaints, but they make the point that they did not receive a response to the complaints. Some people who made serious complaints were not engaged with in a suitable manner.</P>
      <P>One constituent continues to approach me to complain about the investigation into a road death. The constituent has made complaints to all and sundry, including the Garda Commissioner and, recently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will not name names, but I ask that the complaint be considered by the Minister in the context of this Bill. There is a need for somebody within the justice system &mdash; in the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s office or the Minister&rsquo;s office, or within the existing complaints procedures &mdash; to recognise the complaint to which I refer, which relates to County Kilkenny, and to deal with it in a constructive manner. It needs to be dealt with. I came to the House today specifically to claim that the case in question is not being dealt with. If something is not done to deal with the issue, I will name names and make the details public in this House in due course.</P>
      <P>I have received numerous complaints from constituents, but little response from the Minister, unfortunately, about the handling of missing persons cases. I have tried to highlight such cases since I was elected to the House. I have asked for a special unit to be established with the Garda, to be supported by those who are involved in best practice in this area in the United States, continental Europe and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Having travelled to the United States some time ago to investigate these matters, I explained to the previous Garda Commissioner at a meeting of an Oireachtas committee what was being done there. I was amazed to learn that the Garda was in possession of knowledge we thought was fresh and new, but it had not acted on it. The idea for a website, <i>www.missingkids.ie</i>, resulted from dealings with the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. It took more than two years for the centre and the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s office to conclude their negotiations on putting the website in place. That delay is particularly regrettable when one con<Col N="1995"/>siders that the website&rsquo;s success rate has been simply incredible.</P>
      <P>When I was in the United States, I learned of the case of a child who went missing at the age of four and was found at the age of 14. Success was achieved in that instance because the authorities&rsquo; approach to the investigation was consistent &mdash; they simply would not let the case die. Police enforcement agencies in various parts of the US have helped with <i>www.missingkids.ie</i>, which represents a small step in the long process of developing a search protocol that will operate in the cases of those over the age of 18. Such a protocol has not yet been put in place, however.</P>
      <P>If one listens to any of the radio programmes or media reports about the families of missing persons, one will learn that such families believe that nobody engages with them. They do not think they receive any support from the health authorities or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist them with their trauma. Nobody seems to be dealing with such cases. I appreciate that a major effort, Operation Trace, took place but it was just a paper exercise. It was merely a review of the files. I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will visit the issue of missing persons to ensure that greater numbers of garda&iacute; are trained through the exchange programme operated with John Jay College in New York by the Jerry McCabe fellowship. We must engage far more constructively if we are to ensure that people are trained properly. Our willingness to engage must reflect the fact that the authorities in the USA are prepared to co-operate with the Garda and the limited nature of the costs involved.</P>
      <P>The FBI posts three officers to the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington whose dedicated function is to work with the organisation which is sponsored by both the Government and private sectors. The centre was prepared to make technology and personnel available to us. Senator Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s office said she would make her adviser in this area available to the Garda to explain the systems employed, the amber alert protocol, a code Adam and the way in which searches are conducted in the USA. The offer was never taken up.</P>
      <P>If legislative change is necessary, why not make it? Perhaps, the changes can be implemented through the Bill before us. We know the support we need is available. Why not appoint a number of properly qualified people to engage on a regular basis with the families of missing persons to ensure that searches remain ongoing? No Member will have seen a photograph of Jo Jo Dollard since 1995, the year in which she went missing. In the USA, a photograph is updated with the co-operation of the family of the missing person and published in the media, on leaflets, on the Internet and on the backs of milk cartons. Private enterprise co-operates with the process. <Col N="1996"/>Files are continually updated and the public is kept informed.</P>
      <P>We do not do these things. This debate represents the only opportunity I have had to appeal to the Minister to reconsider his position and effect a change in legislation. It would not cost a fortune. I have come to the House from a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts where I was made aware of the number of fortunes to be saved in the context of what goes on in public spending. It is possible to source the funds to facilitate missing persons provisions in the legislation, establish a Garda unit and implement technology based on the <i>www.missingkids.ie</i> website to address the cases of persons who are 18 years of age and over.</P>
      <P>Legislative provisions are also required to clarify how and when a search should be conducted and to establish what should be the Garda response when a person goes missing. If the required changes cannot be made in the Bill, I urge the Minister to bring forward special legislative provisions. We must examine Garda resources for community policing, traffic duties and administration in the context of the prolonged search for a missing person whose body was eventually discovered on her next-door neighbour&rsquo;s property. In another instance, a body was found on the other side of a wall which garda&iacute; had passed 100 times during their search. I do not believe the area of Castledermot in which Jo Jo Dollard went missing was searched to the extent to which it would be searched had she gone missing today.</P>
      <P>All of these cases can be related to those of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman a couple of years ago in the United Kingdom. Police were brought in from other constabulary areas as were other professionals. They searched until they found the missing persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should make a comparison with the search conducted in Cork in more recent times. The response of the general pubic was overwhelming. I call on the Minister and the Garda to try to harness through this and other legislation some of that public support and energy and to establish protocols and a proper approach to the search for missing persons. While I may appear to focus on a single issue, Members would also be encouraged not to let it drop were they to witness the sadness and trauma families experience every day after a person goes missing.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that every effort by me and the family of Jo Jo Dollard to discuss with the Minister the information available from the USA and possible approaches to the issue has failed. I have asked the Government to set out a policy in this area and to coax or cajole the Garda Commissioner to adopt its point of view. I am also disappointed that I have waited for 12 months for an appointment to meet the Garda Commissioner to discuss this matter without result. While he has not failed to respond, he has yet to set a date for a meeting.</P>
      <P>We are a long way from implementing best practice. I encourage the Minister to take on board my comments which are constructively meant. While I wish him well with his legislation, I ask him to respond positively and without delay for the sake of those people who have had people go missing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt with a case in my constituency which was similar to the one outlined by Deputy McGuinness and involved a young woman who went missing. While her phone was eventually found beside a canal, it was a number of days before her body was discovered at the same location. It was very frustrating for the family. The father of the young woman went to the canal and knew that it was not very deep yet the search party did not look in it. The failure added to the family&rsquo;s trauma. While I accept what Deputy McGuinness said about good practice, it would not encourage the families of missing persons. The experience of the family in my constituency and many others raises many questions. It is only when a person one knows goes missing that one is really affected.</P>
      <P>Other Members spoke of anger and frustration in communities, which is not to detract from the positive elements of the Bill. A significant problem in my area is the difficulty of getting through to a Garda station by phone. Despite the fact that it is the 21st century, people speak of it taking 15 or 20 minutes to get through to a station. Whatever about faster cars for garda&iacute;, it is necessary to address basic infrastructural needs. I share the concerns of Deputy McGuinness about drug and drink problems. Parts of my constituency have a higher than average incidence of drug and alcohol misuse than is the case nationally. In many <Col N="1998"/>instances, these problems were not addressed until local community interests got together.</P>

        <Quest>if funding has been set aside by his Department for the development of the western rail corridor; if so, the level of this allocation; when the report commissioned to investigate the re-opening of the corridor will be available; if he has set out a timetable for its development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9800/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The working group on the western rail corridor appointed by my predecessor as Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has met on a regular basis since last June. I understand the working group and its sub-groups are nearing the end of their deliberations. Accordingly, I expect to receive the report of the chairman within the next two months. A decision on the development of the western rail corridor will be taken in the context of the ten-year transport investment framework under preparation by the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my first opportunity to debate with the Minister on transport issues and I wish him well in his new portfolio. However, he has given a very short reply to my question. Will the funding for the western rail corridor, to which the Taoiseach referred in this House in reply to Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte, be ring-fenced? The report of the working group, which the Minister has said will be completed within two months, is expected to be very positive in regard to the development of the western rail corridor. Likewise, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated a positive attitude to such a development.</P>
        <P>If the project is approved, will the estimated &euro;300 million in funding be available? If so, does the Minister expect work to begin on the project in 2005 and will it be completed in stages? There has been much talk of the Ennis-Athenry line, which will cost in the region of &euro;30 million and will link Galway, Limerick and possibly Cork. Is there a timetable for the development of this route? The Department seems to be focused on its ten-year plan but some vision is required in this matter. Can the Minister get this project moving quickly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy regarding the importance of this project and was sitting beside the Taoiseach when he answered questions about it in the Chamber. I have met the chairman of the working group on several <Col N="1999"/>occasions and have asked that the report be completed as quickly as possible. This is an important project containing infrastructural elements that can deliver good value for those in the region. I do not wish to pre-empt the report by speculating whether the development of the corridor should be staged by completing large sections one at a time. However, given the scale of the project, it is likely to be undertaken in major phases.</P>
        <P>The ten-year financial framework announced by the Minister for Finance for my Department represents a colossal amount of money. There is no doubt the resources are there for this project, albeit in competition with other important rail, bus and road projects. I have given much attention to this project and have had numerous discussions in this regard. I will make a final assessment in this matter when I receive the report of the working group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister comment on the major imbalance that exists between the east and west, particularly in regard to the national development plan? Under the plan, public spending for the first three years is running at &euro;1.3 billion in the south and east region as against &euro;155 million in the Border, midlands and west region. What is the Minister&rsquo;s view of yesterday&rsquo;s Central Statistics Office statistics which indicate that incomes in the BMW region are significantly lower than the average incomes in eastern areas? The lack of a transport system on the west coast is a factor in this disparity in that the infrastructure is lacking to attract high value jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>High value jobs are available in the BMW region and the already good infrastructure in the area is being substantially improved. The Deputy may be aware that the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s recently released plans for this year indicate a significant upscaling of investment in the BMW region, with eight or nine of its projects located in that area. Having been responsible for the formulation of the spatial strategy, I appreciate that aspirations towards balanced development must be met by an equitable investment package. People in my area in the south east will also be disconcerted by the CSO figures and will claim the picture is distorted by the dominance of Dublin and that the figures for the southern and eastern region are also relatively low.</P>
        <P>Putting statistics aside, the objective is to achieve substantial investment in the BMW region and to create a regional balance. I am prepared to put a significant amount of infrastructure in place to achieve that end. Activity in the BMW region this year represents a doubling of what took place last year. This is a clear illustration of my intentions in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government and I are very positively disposed towards the western rail corridor. However, I will await the report of the expert working group before taking action in this regard. We will all have a clearer picture once the report is issued.</P>

        <asker>Ms Shortall</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if he will set out his case for either the part-privatisation or full-privatisation of Aer Lingus.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9821/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Tuesday, I briefed my colleagues at Cabinet on a number of key aviation issues, including the future of Aer Lingus. I am anxious in the interests of the airline to move forward on this issue as a matter of urgency. As the House is aware, Aer Lingus must be provided with the flexibility to grow and compete on a level playing field.</P>
        <P>The current situation is not sustainable and is restricting the airline, particularly in regard to profitable growth opportunities on long haul routes. To fund that growth and to provide financial security, Aer Lingus must have access to the full range of funding mechanisms. Equity capital is a crucial element in that mix. Early clarity on realistic options for accessing that equity are crucial and I will bring specific proposals in this regard to Government shortly. I will continue to consult stakeholders as I move forward on this issue.</P>
        <P>If the Government decides to embark on a sale of all or part of Aer Lingus, I will set out for the House, in accordance with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, the general principles of the proposed sale as well as the basis for the Government&rsquo;s decision and the arguments for and against such a sale. I will also set out how the Government proposes to deal with important strategic issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister be more specific about Aer Lingus&rsquo;s needs? There is much talk of urgency in regard to access to equity but the chairman of the company is not in agreement in this regard. He is in the process of replacing the short haul fleet and is considering the question of long haul fleet replacement in the coming years, in which regard there are a number of options. Various figures have been quoted but has the Minister an estimate from the board of Aer Lingus regarding the company&rsquo;s capital requirement and the timescale over which such might be delivered? Has he carried out any type of serious <Col N="2001"/>examination of the different options available to Aer Lingus for meeting its needs? The Minister does not seem to be making a case for even the part-privatisation of the company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been involved in a detailed analysis of the prospects. The current chairman has written to me recently to urge me to emphasise the enormous opportunities in the immediate future for Aer Lingus, but decisions need to be made immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the capital requirements?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that in a moment. I will give the Deputy an example. It was clear even three or four months ago that the buying opportunities for airlines <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the manufacturers was very opportune. I have been anxious to place Aer Lingus within that window of opportunity to get the best possible deal from manufacturers in terms of ordering aircraft. Recently, for example, China made substantial orders with Boeing and that has taken some of the pressure off the manufacturer. While the window of opportunity in terms of purchasing aircraft has not closed, it is closing fast as more and more airlines purchase new fleets for the future. Aer Lingus must order fairly quickly, not just for that reason but because it will take a lead-in time of about 18 months to acquire the aircraft and get them operational. At present Aer Lingus has seven long haul aircraft in its transatlantic fleet, all of which need to be replaced immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The chairman is not saying they need to be replaced immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He is. He has written to me since&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall will allow the Minister to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to disagree with the Deputy, but he has been quite clear on this since he was appointed fully as chairman of the board of Aer Lingus, as distinct from being acting chairman. As the Deputy knows, he is acting in the capacity of executive chairman at present. The prospects for growth essentially are tremendous and not just on the transatlantic route, although that is where the immediate opportunities lie.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is denying that. How much does the company need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the airline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the Deputy back in, but she must let the Minister finish.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2002"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister not established that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wants me to answer the question rather than interrupting me, I will try to facilitate her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow Deputy Shortall back in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I started by referring to the immediate replacement of the seven existing planes, which is very substantial in itself. We believe 21 destinations in America are anxious to have Aer Lingus flying in to them. I do not believe any airline, even Aer Lingus, could do that overnight, but it shows the scale and depth of opportunity that is available in the US market. I would like Aer Lingus to gather at an early stage a number of these new routes and destinations and to be in a position to serve them within 18 months, in addition to what it already has flying into the US. Equally there are opportunities in the Middle East, South Africa and, the Far East.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister a figure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not for me to put figures on it at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, since the Minister has been talking about floating part of the company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is public knowledge that every plane costs about &euro;110 million, so it is easy to work out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not talking about an up-front payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The sort of capacity scale, at a very minimum is indicative of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.2 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is over a considerable period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Deputy should listen to what I am saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all lease agreements now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter. In terms of the balance sheet and the airline&rsquo;s viability it is a misnomer to suggest that somehow a leasing arrangement in terms of the financial base effect is fundamentally different to purchasing. It is not. My advice is that it is almost the same effect, so the argument is spurious. Airlines will make decisions on a ratio of purchasing to leasing aircraft for different reasons, but not for the one which the Deputy suggested. I am not making that point in an argumentative way, just stating that those are the facts as I understand them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2003"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The key issue is that the Minister does not know the company&rsquo;s capital requirements. If there is a case for part privatisation, it should be made. Let us have the figures on the table to see what the capital requirements will be over the next ten years and the best ways of meeting them. I want the Minister to tell the House whether he is considering at least a part privatisation of the company, as he seems to be. I want him to outline how he can guarantee the strategic interests of the State will be protected in that type of scenario. The Goldman Sachs report seems to indicate that they cannot be and that the notion of a golden share is nonsense.</P>
        <P>What type of mechanism has the Minister in mind? The figure of &euro;300 million has been bandied about in the media. If, for example, he was to sell &euro;300 million worth of the company, what happens to that money? As matters stand, in a straight deal that goes into the Government coffers. It does nothing to help the company. What type of mechanism does he therefore have in mind? Is he talking about the State reinvesting the &euro;300 million in the company or what exactly has he in mind? Is this just a mechanism for boosting the Government coffers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not about to start speculating in the House at this point about the financial situation as regards Aer Lingus. I will not signal to the market this afternoon what I believe the company is worth or not worth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is very vague. He does not know the company&rsquo;s capital requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must conclude his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do and I have stated in my reply to the Deputy that when a decision is made under the Act, I will set it all out for her. There is nothing vague about what I have said as regards the immediate requirements of the long haul fleet of Aer Lingus, which cannot be funded from within its own resources. It is funding its expansion into Europe at the moment from its own resources, which is putting a great strain on the company.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Crowe </asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if, in view of the conflicting information surrounding the Dublin Port tunnel, he is considering a review of his position on supercube trucks using this tunnel.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Following my announcement in October 2004 the operational height of the Dublin Port tunnel will not be changed. The tunnel is being completed as planned and will have an operational height of 4.65 m.</P>
        <P>It is the view of Dublin City Council and the National Roads Authority that the Dublin Port tunnel will facilitate almost all of the HGV traffic currently using Dublin Port. Provision for those HGVs unable to use the tunnel is a matter for Dublin City Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I know I have raised this issue with the Minister before and it is not something that will go away. It has long-term implications for traffic in Dublin. Does the Minister agree the tunnel could be modified at a low cost to provide for clearance while meeting all Irish and international safety standards? Will he comment on the specific detailed proposals submitted by the transport umbrella group, outlining how this could be done by reducing the width of the traffic lanes and dropping the level of the tunnel&rsquo;s floor? The independent consultants appointed by the Minister to report on the feasibility of modifying the tunnel&rsquo;s clearances, concluded that works required to implement the modifications would not involve massive changes. If it is a matter of just moving out the lane which would fit all of these trucks why is the Minister opposed to this? It does not make sense if supercube trucks are coming more and more on stream. Rather than having them driving through the Dublin streets, what the consultants propose seems so logical and simple and makes sense. It would mean removing that type of traffic from the city&rsquo;s roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made the point on a number of occasions on why I would not reverse the decision on the tunnel, for reasons of finance, delays etc. I have another reason &mdash; I simply do not want those enormous trucks here. We looked at the situation in 12 countries including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the USA, all of which have lower requirements. I do not see the reason or the need to have these enormous <Col N="2005"/>trucks on our roads. Quite simply the cost of them in terms of maintaining our roads and the damage is huge. The safety aspect of driving through our streets is also a major consideration.</P>
        <P>My view in terms of the tunnel is that we are more than adequately equipped relative to most of our European competitors, in fact all of them. They are not above that figure. I know the Minister of State is currently involved with the Irish Road Haulage Association, in terms of getting an overall picture for the country. I am giving the Deputy my view, which I believe to be correct. One comes to a point where one makes a decision in these matters. Looking at international best practice, the height restrictions on the Dublin Port tunnel are adequately above the restrictions for tunnels in other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The tunnel is suitable for these trucks if there is a slight inexpensive modification. The Minister refers to the effects this will have on the roads. Is the Minister referring to the weight of the trucks as restrictions already exist in this regard? Is he claiming these trucks will cause more damage on the roads?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not in favour of allowing these large trucks on the road. Sinn F&eacute;in wants them on the roads in Ireland, unlike most European countries, but I disagree with the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not asking about the Sinn F&eacute;in position. I asked the Minister a question which he has not answered.</P>

	<P>I could not be more clear with the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister ban these types of trucks?</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>the progress to date in the negotiations between Irish and US officials on completing a new bilateral aviation agreement or amending the existing agreement between Ireland and the US; the proposed details of this agreement, particularly on the status of the Shannon gateway; when these negotiations will reach completion; his views on the European Commission&rsquo;s perspective on such negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9801/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My officials are in contact with the US authorities to explore what adjustments to the Ireland-US arrangements are possible. An informal meeting took place on 7 February when senior US officials were in Dublin for a seminar on aviation regulation organised by the Institute of European Affairs. No conclusions were reached at that meeting.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate to disclose Ireland&rsquo;s position during the course of these discussions. However, I am aware the new board of <Col N="2006"/>Shannon Airport is required to produce a business plan for the airport. The clarity on the open skies issue will be helpful to that business planning process. I am also aware that Irish airlines are restricted in the routes they can serve under the existing bilateral arrangement. Expanding scheduled transatlantic services is of great importance to the growth of Irish airlines and tourism.</P>
        <P>Whatever new arrangements are agreed, Shannon Airport must remain an attractive destination in America, particularly on the east coast of the US. Aer Lingus has said there is a strong transatlantic market for Shannon and it will continue to serve that market. Any change in Ireland-US arrangements will open up new destinations in the US for Aer Lingus, presenting new opportunities for Shannon. I am convinced that Shannon, with the right cost base for the airport and with the proper competitive environment, can maintain and grow its transatlantic business.</P>
        <P>European Regulation 847/2004 permits member states to negotiate with third countries, including the USA, after informing the European Commission of the intended negotiations. The European Commission was informed of Ireland&rsquo;s contacts with the US, and a Commission representative was present during previous Ireland-US discussions in May 2004.</P>
        <P>On 16 March 2005 the European Commission sent infringement letters to 20 EU member states, including Ireland, that have bilateral air transport agreements with the US. The letter was received by Ireland on 21 March 2005. While this letter does not relate to current discussions with the US, the Commission expresses the view that due to certain aspects of its bilateral aviation agreement with the US, Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under the treaty establishing the European Community. The Commission has asked for a response within two months of receipt of the letter. This is a complex matter that must be carefully examined before a reply can be issued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am astonished to hear the Minister claim that Aer Lingus believes Shannon has a strong transatlantic market. When Mr. Walsh was with Aer Lingus he removed many transatlantic services from the airport, particularly on the EI 111 route, from which a percentage of seats were transferred to Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister doing to protect Shannon Airport? Government policy is to encourage balanced regional development, yet the Minister is doing nothing to protect this regional airport. The European Commission has sent letters to 20 EU member states regarding their bilateral air transport agreements with the US. However, the former European Commissioner for Transport, Loyola de Palacio, and her successor, Jacques Barrot, did not see a problem with Ireland having its own bilateral agreement with the US.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2007"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why then did the Commission send us a letter on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different story to do with competition. It is on the record that Mr. Barrot has no problem with Ireland having its own bilateral agreement. The Minister has done nothing to protect Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P>In a recent report, Tourism Ireland stated that an open skies policy would result in Shannon&rsquo;s transatlantic business becoming seasonal. The chambers of commerce report, by Mr. Dukes and Mr. S&oslash;rensen, stated that Shannon would lose up to 40% of business under an open skies system. While the Government is good at producing reports and policy documents, it still has not carried out an impact study on the open skies policy. As it will be important to understand the effects an open skies policy will have on the mid-west region, will the Minister carry out an impact study?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the Deputy&rsquo;s claims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is heavily involved in this matter which is why I initiated discussions with the US. It is inevitable the EU and the US will reach agreement on an open skies into Europe policy, which will be in the best interest of all consumers. I have been charged by the Government to ensure the best possible deal for the future of Shannon Airport. The Deputy claimed the Government has done nothing. We have given the airport its autonomy to chart its own development. The board is doing tremendous work. The recent announcement by Ryanair on further services in Shannon Airport show it has a future in the European market. From my contacts in the US and elsewhere, I have learned that Shannon Airport has a future.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should contrast the attitude in Shannon with that in Cork Airport. As there is no restriction on Cork Airport entering transatlantic services, it will soon do so. The real threat to the future of Shannon Airport is Cork Airport. As the Deputy presents it, Shannon simply wants to stick its head in the sand and not go after the large opportunities available. Shannon is a marquee name in the US. If I was a member of the Shannon Airport board, I would be looking at the new market opportunities as its competitors are already doing so.</P>
        <P>It is important that statements are not made in the House that will undermine Shannon on the international stage. It is in a strong market position. The Government is committed to its future and wants it to develop both its European and US routes. I will ensure that Shannon has a good transition phase before the European open skies policy comes into force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s claims are typical of his Government colleagues&rsquo; attempts to drive <Col N="2008"/>a wedge between the people of Shannon and Cork. This will not happen because the people of Cork and Shannon will bond on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That will not be the case because they are both independent airports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The chambers of commerce report stated that Cork and Shannon airports would be the big losers in an open skies agreement. A bilateral agreement is there not just to protect Shannon but also Aer Lingus as it is a small carrier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is crippling Aer Lingus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not. I welcome Ryanair&rsquo;s developments in the airport. However, it is important that we do not put all our eggs in the one basket. Shannon accounts for 44% of the transatlantic business. This will be eroded in an open skies system as the large transatlantic carriers will concentrate on where the big business is, namely, Dublin Airport. I agree marketing is important. However, if the national carrier does not favour Shannon Airport, resulting in the loss of an all-year-round transatlantic service, tourism and industry in the region will suffer.</P>
        <P>US chambers of commerce have stated they want a direct daily service into Shannon Airport. The Minister is not doing enough to protect this service even though the European Commission has no problem with such an arrangement.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject these claims. They are grossly unfair and do a disservice to all the work the good people at Shannon Airport are doing in developing the airport. The Deputy should acknowledge their efforts. There are many opportunities to ensure Shannon has an all-round daily service to the US. There is potential to do a great deal more and Shannon Airport should grasp that opportunity. I am confident that the board and the workers in Shannon see this and are looking to the future.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if he is committed to open road tolling; the steps he has taken to expedite this matter; when the necessary legislation will be published; the cost of its introduction at the West Link toll bridge; and <Col N="2009"/>the timescale proposed for the new system to be in place.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9823/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Open road tolling, that is, the collection of tolls by automated means in a barrier free environment, is the optimal means of toll collection where the traffic volumes and toll revenues justify the investment required. The only route where a move to full open road tolling, that is, no manual collection and barrier free, is being considered, however, is the M50. The move from the current toll arrangement on the M50 to a barrier free facility would be completed over a number of stages, involving a phased reduction in the cashier-coin basket lanes with a corresponding increase in payments by automated toll collection methods. The objective on other toll schemes, where the traffic volumes and toll revenues would not justify full open road tolling, will be to continue to provide a mix of manual and automated toll collection facilities.</P>
        <P>The legislative changes necessary to facilitate the implementation of barrier free tolling on automated toll collection lanes on other toll schemes through the implementation of appropriate deterrents for non-payment of tolls have been the subject of consultation with the National Roads Authority, the National Toll Roads and other companies with an interest in the operation of toll plazas. I anticipate, subject to the other priorities on the legislative programme, that the draft legislation will be introduced in autumn of this year.</P>
        <P>I understand from the NRA that the cost of implementing barrier free tolling on the M50 has yet to be determined and will depend on the outcome of negotiations with NTR. The NRA is aiming to complete the move to barrier free tolling to coincide with the completion of the upgrade of the M50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>My question has been superseded somewhat by the comments of the chief executive of the NRA yesterday to the Joint Committee on Transport. He indicated that the NRA is examining the possibility of buying out the NTR contract, removing the tolls on the West Link bridge and replacing them with demand management tolls on the approach roads. It is an interesting proposition which has much merit. Does the Minister wish to comment on it? Is he aware that the NRA is examining this matter? What is his opinion of that approach to tolling on the M50?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of what the new chief executive of the NRA said yesterday. However, I believe there has been an over-interpretation in the reporting of his remarks. The impression has been given that there is an immediate prospect of the toll plaza being bought but that is not the case. The income stream from the toll plaza is funding the upgrade of the M50. It is an important stream of finance.</P>
        <P>In the future there will be issues surrounding traffic into Dublin and demand management will legitimately arise in the context of how the M50 <Col N="2010"/>is used by consumers. However, it is not an immediate prospect. That should be made clear because I got the impression today that this is a matter that is under negotiation in a detailed way. There are no proposals on my desk or in the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>I met NTR recently and told its representatives in unequivocal terms that I am anxious to move to barrier free tolling as quickly as possible. I do not accept that a timeframe of four or five years is necessary to achieve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that it should not take that long. I asked the Minister to comment on the proposal which is emerging from the NRA. It is a cost neutral proposal. The NRA is not talking about removing the tolls but about facilitating free flow on the M50 and replacing the existing tolls with demand management tolls on the approach roads. There would be no cost to the State. Is the Minister well disposed to that proposal? It appears to have much merit. Buying the NTR concession would be expensive but the Minister could maintain a revenue stream and recoup the cost of buying the NTR concession through new tolls on the approach roads. Obviously, it is a complex legal issue but if the NRA can resolve that, it would hope to bring firm proposals to the Minister quite soon. Is the Minister well disposed to that approach and does he anticipate supporting it in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of it in the context of the general issues being considered to make Dublin a more accessible city and how to manage its traffic. In that context, it is a legitimate part of that process. However, to be fair to people who use transport, be it public transport or private cars, to reach that point it will be necessary to have the new public transport infrastructure in place before making such a dramatic change. I am not convinced that doing it in isolation would be an immediate success. It would if the investment were already in place and much of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The solution to freeing the M50, and I am open to correction on this, is badly needed investment in public transport facilities. That is my focus at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in conjunction with Meath and Fingal County Councils, recently completed a feasibility study into the possibility of providing a spur off the Maynooth line at Clonsilla to Pace on the N3 beyond Dunboyne. The provision of a park and ride site at Pace to cater for Navan traffic has been included in the feasibility study.</P>
        <P>It is now a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in the first instance, to consider the results of the study and to decide how it wishes to proceed. The views of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the results of the feasibility study will be considered by my Department as part of its preparatory work on the proposed ten-year investment framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister gave me the same answer a month ago. There is no progress.</P>

	<P>It was before the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The following day the Minister came to Navan where he was able to speak about the Navan rail link in more detail. He confirmed it would be provided. The Minister&rsquo;s party candidate in the by-election confirmed in his election material that the rail link had been secured for Dunboyne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a great guy; he was pushing hard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>He would be embarrassed if he were present today to hear that reply. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that it is happy to build the line. However, two things are required. It is seeking a commitment of funding. Can the Depart<Col N="2012"/>ment ring-fence funding to deliver this rail link? I accept that it is affected by what happens in Dublin but the Navan to Dunboyne link should be built at the same time the work is being done in Dublin rather that one waiting until the other is completed, which is crazy. That is a decision for the Minister through the allocation of funding.</P>
        <P>Second, the Minister was most encouraging a month ago with regard to providing the money to complete the second part of the feasibility study on building a link from Dunboyne to Navan. He agreed with me that it would be sensible to have it ready. We should consider doing it.</P>
        <P>When I asked the Taoiseach about this matter he said he saw merit in the rail link being built parallel with the M3 motorway. He also agreed that it had not been considered. I am sure it was not considered because nobody can confirm that it was. Will the Minister examine this? Is it possible to construct the rail link in line with the motorway given that land is being compulsorily purchased for the road? Other countries do it so why not this country? It is a shame it has not been considered. It would save a great deal of money for the Exchequer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question. Please give us the money. It would be worthwhile doing this now before the process goes further.</P>
        <P>When will a decision be made about the Spencer Dock development? That has a major effect on the rail link to Dunboyne and Navan. I hope when this question is asked again in a month that there will have been progress.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are <i>ad idem</i> on most of this. Clearly, the indications are, although I have not seen the final decision, that the Dunboyne spur is sensible. I did not make my remarks last month simply because the by-election was taking place. It also seems obvious that if one is to manage the strategy of housing density and the facilities that go with it, public transport must be an essential element. In Navan, I highlighted the experience of Midleton, where they planned the land use strategically to make a rail link inevitable. The same thing applies to the extended spur to Navan. It is a logical extension of what should be there. I have urged the county council to start working on those plans now. I will not take this Dunboyne project on its own. There is a range of very interesting projects in Dublin, the suburbs, the commuter belt and inter-city. We are getting near completion on the overall picture.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister think the feasibility rule may be affected by the nature of the road connections to Navan? With regard to the ten year framework, of which this is one example, does the Department of Finance give the Minister an indicative budget for ten years time? Does the Minister for Transport then allocate resources accordingly? How does he decide between different projects? Are there any projects that fall outside the scope because of the lack of possible funding?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On 16 March 2005, the European Commission decided to send infringement letters to 20 EU member states, including Ireland, that have bilateral air transport agreements with the USA. Ireland received that letter on 21 March 2005.</P>
        <P>In the letter, the Commission expressed the view that, due to certain aspects of the EU bilateral aviation agreement with the USA, Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under the treaty establishing the European Community. The Commission has asked for a response within two months of receipt of the letter. This is a complex matter that will be examined carefully before a reply can be issued. Until that consideration is complete, I will not be in a position to comment on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="2015"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission is clearly preparing an open skies policy. It does not like the existing agreements in 20 different countries, so we are not alone on this. It is in preparation for the EU-US summit next month on open skies. The EU is entitled to take that view. I am taking legal advice on the implications of the letter. I will not put Ireland, particularly Shannon, in a weakened position by sitting back and doing nothing while the EU and the US come to a new agreement. We must position Ireland in a positive light. We must make sure we can do business with the US so that we can develop Shannon and air traffic between Ireland and the US.</P>

	<P>I do not want to be put in the position in which the Deputy is trying to put me. I am in a negotiating position at the moment. I am fixed on what we are trying to do.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister interfering with Government policy when he interferes with the current bilateral agreement? The reports we hear from Washington and Dublin mention a three year lead-in period for the ending of the agreement. Can the Minister comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no idea where that is coming from. I am in a negotiating position at the moment. Deputies should expect that I do not show my cards in the House. I would not expect them to do it if they were in my position. I want to make sure that we get the best possible deal. There are great opportunities for Shannon and I will ensure that it gets the benefit of those opportunities.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>People I met in Cork believe there is a possibility of direct flights from Cork to the US. That is the point of the independence granted to Cork and Shannon airports. For a long time, they did not want to be restricted by Dublin. There are great opportunities in many different directions, one of which is the transatlantic route. Cork will surely benefit from that.</P>

        <Quest>the new technical checks that have been introduced as part of the driving test; the reason these technical checks were introduced; if he plans to introduce further reforms of the driving test procedure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9683/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The technical checks, which have formed part of the driving test with effect from 14 February 2005, were introduced to meet our obligations under EU Directive 2000/56/EC on driver licensing. The technical checks involve candidates being asked to explain how he or she might carry out three out of a number of checks on the vehicle. If, for example, a person is asked to show how oil levels should be checked, it will be necessary to open the bonnet, point to the oil dipstick and explain how oil levels should be checked. A test candidate will not have to carry out the procedure but should know how to do so.</P>
        <P>Additional technical checks relating principally to trucks and buses will be introduced when suitable off-road compounds become available at selected test centres throughout the country. The Office of Public Works, in consultation with my Department, is in the process of providing such compounds.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the introduction of technical checks, the motorcycle driving test has been enhanced by the use of a radio link between the driver tester and candidate. This will allow for a better test experience. While the content of the driving test is kept under review, no further reforms of the driving test procedure are envisaged at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying Ireland is now fully in compliance with EU guidelines in this regard?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>While we have more technical checks as part of the driving test, is this slowing down the process as a result? Will the waiting list for driving tests become longer? If so, will the Department of Transport employ more testers in future to compensate for that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned to ensure that the driving test backlog is cleared. Where jobs might be at stake, especially for young people, it is important for them to be able to take their driving tests as quickly and efficiently as possible. The additional checks are good for safety and are helpful in engendering an understanding of vehicles but they will not necessarily slow down the testing process. Driver testing legislation is going through the House which will bring about positive changes for those seeking tests in future.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>when the 120 new rail carriages that have been ordered by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will be operating on the rail system; the precise routes these carriages will serve; when the new hourly services between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Limerick will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9681/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that 120 new intercity railcars, ordered at the end of 2004, will begin entering service in 2007. The railcars will operate on the Dublin-Westport-Ballina, Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Tralee, Dublin-Waterford and Dublin-Limerick-Ennis routes. Their introduction into service will allow Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to provide hourly services on the Dublin-Limerick route with a mix of direct and shuttle services to connect with Cork trains.</P>
        <P>With the introduction into service of 67 new carriages later this year, which are additional to the 120 I have just mentioned, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects to begin hourly services on the Dublin-Cork route before the end of this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What other additions to the fleet are proposed? Are there other additions in the pipeline for the remainder of this year and into next year or is that the end of the current allocation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The current order is the largest ever placed. I do not have any plans before me for further orders this year. The major event this year will be getting the 67 new carriages into service on the Dublin-Cork route. That is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s priority, along with getting the other order on stream. When this order has been completed in 2007-08, the rail fleet in Ireland will be the most modern in Europe. That is a dramatic transformation from recent times.</P>
        <P>The intention is to upscale continually. The fleet will deal with all the main intercity routes. For example, the Dublin-Cork service will be hourly all day, Dublin-Limerick will be hourly with a mix of some trains connecting with the Cork service, Galway will be hourly at peak times and two-hourly off-peak, Waterford will be every two hours all day, Sligo will be every two hours all day, and Westport will have existing services plus additional shuttle services between Athlone and Westport to connect with the Galway services.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann wants to sort out all the main intercity services. There will be other investment in rail facilities into Dublin. When the ten-year framework is announced shortly, it will be indicative in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the new rail carriages be larger than the existing ones? Currently, at peak times, particularly on the Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Limerick routes, there is standing room <Col N="2018"/>only. This is so at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. Will Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann increase the number of carriages or will the carriages be larger? How old is the existing intercity fleet? Have these carriages passed their sell-by date and, if so, will that rolling stock be sold to another country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of them are very old. I do not have the specific technical details to hand. I agree with the Deputy, however, that it is unacceptable for passengers to have to stand while travelling on a modern public transport system. The purpose of introducing the new carriages is to remove that problem. I do not have statistics for the capacity per coach but the new stock will represent a major improvement in services, including hourly and two-hourly departures to and from all major cities. There is no question but that we will overcome the unfortunate position whereby some people have had to stand on long journeys.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recognise the progress that has been made on the railway services, including the rail lines and rolling stock. Is there a programme to replace mainline stations? Waterford, in particular, requires upgrading fairly quickly and some other stations are in poor condition.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to his public transport plan, which we all await, but has he brought it to the Cabinet sub-committee? He said he was going to do so in early March. Has he received Cabinet approval for the plan? When does he expect to announce details of the plan?</P>

	<P>We have just completed a &euro;100 million upgrade of Connolly Station but the Deputy is correct in stating that a number of stations throughout the country are in need of refurbishment. Planning is ongoing within Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to upgrade such stations. It is only right because people should have a good experience in using public transport &mdash; not just the vehicles but also the facilities with which they interact. The investment programme will continue. I subscribe fully to the Deputy&rsquo;s views on Waterford Station which badly needs upgrading.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 29 and 125 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 2 today. Last Tuesday, I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on a number of key aviation issues, including the future of Aer Lingus. In the interests of the airline, I am anxious to move forward on this issue as a matter of urgency. Aer Lingus must be provided with the flexibility to grow and compete on a level playing field.</P>
        <P>The current situation is not sustainable and restricts the airline, particularly with regard to profitable growth opportunities on long haul routes. To fund that growth and provide financial security, Aer Lingus must have access to the full range of funding mechanisms and equity capital is a critical element in that mix. Early clarity on realistic options for accessing that equity is crucial and I will bring specific proposals in this regard to Government shortly. I will continue to consult stakeholders as I move forward on this issue.</P>
        <P>If the Government decides to embark on a sale of all or part of Aer Lingus, I will set out for the House, in accordance with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, the general principles of the proposed sale as well as the basis for the Government&rsquo;s decision and the arguments for and against such a sale. I will also set out how the Government proposes to deal with important strategic issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>First, does the Minister accept that Aer Lingus has made a major contribution to the economy and the country generally as an island nation? Does he accept there is a danger that we might lose that contribution? Second, does the Minister agree that the staff of Aer Lingus made considerable sacrifices to contribute to the company? Does he agree that they deserve support and credit, and that it was not just one person who turned the company around? Third, does the Minister accept that Members of the House and elected public representatives, particularly in north Dublin city and county, as well as nationally, have major problems with privatisation? They are concerned that others want priv<Col N="2020"/>atisation for its own sake rather than dealing with the real world.</P>
        <P>With regard to aviation policy, who is the Minister talking about when he refers to the stakeholders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I put on record the answer to a number of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions when answering Deputy Shortall. I accept that Aer Lingus has made a significant contribution to Ireland, nationally and internationally. As the Taoiseach, the Government and I have stated on many occasions, the unions, the board, the former chief executive and others have achieved the turnaround of that airline. It was the result of much hard work and is an ongoing process.</P>
        <P>My job is to make sure we progress Aer Lingus into the future. All of the stakeholders &mdash; the social partners, trade unions, the management, the board and the Government &mdash; are <i>ad idem</i> in accepting that Aer Lingus needs substantial investment quickly to take advantage of the huge opportunities that exist. There is no disagreement on any side with regard to this fundamental point.</P>
        <P>The issue is not just about investing and then walking away. Aer Lingus needs to compete on a level playing field with other airlines, which it is not in a position to do at present. I want to correct this. Aer Lingus has an opportunity to become a far more substantial airline, achieving far more for this country, if we make crucial and correct decisions now about placing it in the right shape for the future. I have been having discussions on this with the stakeholders for the past five months. I am glad these have been positive, open discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister consider the Airbus A330, which is used on transatlantic routes, a suitable replacement for existing aircraft given that many carriers are choosing smaller aircraft for those routes? For example, Continental Airlines uses a Boeing 757 with much less capacity.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated there were opportunities for Aer Lingus to open new routes to 20 different destinations in the US. Are these year-round routes or seasonal? Given that Aer Lingus is a relatively small airline compared to US carriers, Lufthansa and British Airways, of which the former Aer Lingus chief executive is now chief executive, will it be able to compete against such mega-carriers on transatlantic routes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question on the operational matter of the type of aircraft is outside the scope of this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might get through it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>He might want to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an operational matter on which I have no view. I trust those charged with that responsibility will make the best decision in <Col N="2021"/>the interests of the airline and passengers in terms of volume, scope and potential growth.</P>
        <P>With regard to the final question, I am not presenting Aer Lingus as some kind of mega-global player trying to compete all over the world. I have identified specific markets where there are excellent opportunities for an Irish airline. I want that airline to be Aer Lingus, operating out of Ireland. I am determined that these opportunities be taken up by Aer Lingus and not any other airline. On that basis, it can compete on transatlantic and other routes.

	<P>The Minister stated in his initial reply that when Cabinet takes the decision he will bring all the information to the House on the basis for the decision and the arguments for and against. However, the arguments for and against should be provided at this point. The Minister speaks of being involved in negotiations with the stakeholders. All the Members present, as public representatives, are stakeholders; we represent the public interest and the taxpayer who currently owns this successful company.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a responsibility to make the arguments in the House for and against any proposed change in the ownership structure of Aer Lingus. The main purpose of my Priority Question was to draw out the Minister on this point and get him to make the arguments. Let us have a discussion to try to establish the company&rsquo;s needs into the future, the best ways of meeting those needs, the most appropriate structure for this and how the strategic interests of the country can be safeguarded. That discussion should be in public. There is a range of views on this issue and much merit in the different proposals.</P>

	<P>With all due respect, it is of no benefit to the workers and management to have Members speculating on speculative figures that may be completely meaningless until we get to the crunch point of getting the company into the market. I must listen to staff, management, other experts and the market. There is much evidence on this issue. The Deputy is experienced and well read in these matters, and she knows the opportunities that exist. I want to make sure we create opportunities for the company to seize. The chairman of Aer Lingus, the trade unions directly involved and the social partners all accept there are huge opportunities for the company and that it needs substantial capital to begin this process immediately.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee on Transport heard the basic argument for a private sector investment on the basis that long-haul aeroplanes had to be replaced. There was no business secrecy; it was a simple fact. It would cost about &euro;1 billion and we questioned from where the money would come.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s point. The Minister said he had talked to the stakeholders &mdash; the unions and social partners in the partnership process. We live in a democracy. The Members of this House represent the people. We are the representative stakeholders. If the Minister can talk to the unions and social partners, and if there is a basic question about funding for replacement of the long-haul fleet, regardless of any commercial sensitivities--&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall is correct. In those circumstances, why should we not debate the basic principle, as stated by Deputy Finian McGrath?</P>
        <P>Perhaps my maths is poor but it was reported we would get perhaps &euro;300 million for selling the company, a figure that could be wrong by perhaps &euro;50 million either way. We know that roughly &euro;1 billion is required for the replacement argued for <Col N="2023"/>at committee by the chairman of the company. This leaves a gap of &euro;700 million. Would private sector investors borrow to pay for the long haul aircraft? If so, where is the benefit? Are we doing all this for &euro;300 million? Could we not borrow the full &euro;1 billion ourselves? The Minister says the airline is threatened with becoming uncompetitive due to operational problems. It is one of the most profitable and successful airlines in the world. Why are we selling a stake for &euro;300 million when the company needs &euro;1 billion? Will the gap be bridged by private lending and why do we not borrow the money ourselves?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If Aer Lingus ends up only investing that much, it will have failed in its opportunities. That goes nowhere near what the potential opportunities for the company are.</P>
        <P>I will correct one item which may be misunderstood. There are 21 airport destinations in North America interested in having Aer Lingus flying in to them. I have not said that Aer Lingus wants to fly to all 21 destinations. There are subtle differences involved which I will not go into because clearly there are commercially valuable routes which I will not flag to other airlines which are equally interested in them.</P>
        <P>The following is very important. Before we give opportunities to other companies which are competitors to Aer Lingus, I want Aer Lingus to have those opportunities first. That is what we should all be striving to achieve. This is not about playing with figures. It is about positioning one of the most important companies in this country for significant growth in jobs and in the Irish economy.</P>

        <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that his Department&rsquo;s road safety strategy is operating successfully; if not, if he is considering introducing additional measures in view of the increase in the number of road deaths in 2004 and 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[9709/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003 period. Achievement of the target will result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is an ambitious target and one which will require a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies.</P><Col N="2024"/>
        <P>Unfortunately we have seen a greater number of road deaths in 2004 than the previous year with provisional end of year figures for 2004 showing 380 deaths on the roads. So far this year we have seen an increase in the number of road deaths with 89 deaths on the roads as at 21 March compared with 85 for the same date last year. The recent increase in road deaths is a cause of concern to us all. This places the challenge of meeting the target set for the end of 2006 into stark focus. If we are to realise that target, a significant reversal of the worrying trend that has been noticeable since early 2004 must be achieved.</P>
        <P>Achievement of the target depends in the first instance on a continued emphasis on the approach that underpins the strategy. A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing remains the correct approach and these remain the key areas of the new strategy.</P>
        <P>The strategy proposes a range of measures in the enforcement, engineering, education and legislation areas in order to target further reductions in deaths and injuries. An integrated strategic approach will ensure that the road safety agencies work together to achieve the targets set out in the new strategy.</P>
        <P>A critical initiative that will have a significant impact on road safety is the establishment of the new Garda traffic corps. The establishment of a dedicated corps of garda&iacute;, as announced late last year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, under a distinct management structure within the overall force will provide for the significant enhancement of the deterrent effect that emanates from high levels of traffic law enforcement.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>The situation in Letterkenny General Hospital is chaotic. Since last January, upwards of 15 patients a night are being accommodated on trolleys in the day services unit and the accident and emergency department at the hospital, resulting in the cancellation of day service procedures, elective procedures and leading to gross overcrowding in the accident and emergency department. Last Tuesday there were 26 patients on trolleys waiting for beds. Today, the situation has improved somewhat, in that the total number on trolleys is 13, nine in the day services unit and four in casualty.</P>
        <P>This week, all elective surgery has been cancelled, along with day services procedures, and this has been the pattern almost continually since last July. Patients awaiting hip replacements, knee replacements, hernia operations and such procedures are being left to suffer without knowing when they will be treated. All of this mayhem is caused by a chronic shortage of beds in the hospital.</P>
        <P>Letterkenny General Hospital caters for a population in excess of 130,000 with only 286 beds to accommodate in-patients. It is probably one of the lowest <i>per capita</i> bed ratios in the country. Doctors, nurses and staff in general are doing their utmost under impossible working conditions. As a regular visitor to the hospital I have seen for myself the turmoil that is a regular fea<Col N="2026"/>ture in casualty. One could justifiably say that it is more like what one would expect in a Third World country than in the so-called richest country in the EU.</P>
        <P>The situation has been allowed to continue to deteriorate because Letterkenny General Hospital has been starved of resources. While the medical and nursing staff are among the best in the country, the facilities they have to work with are woefully inadequate. The requirements of the hospital have been identified and generally accepted. Top priority must be given to the provision of a new accident and emergency department as the present unit is woefully inadequate. It treats some 30,000 cases per annum and it is only about one quarter of the size required for treating so many patients. It is cramped, confined, overcrowded and completely inadequate to meet its demands.</P>
        <P>An approval to proceed to planning for a new accident and emergency unit was given by the Department of Health and Children in July 2003. Plans were submitted to the Department in October 2004. Since then, nothing has happened. We are now awaiting approval to proceed to the next stage, the appointment of an architectural team. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of that approval and I am asking that it should be granted without further delay.</P>
        <P>It is also accepted that Letterkenny General Hospital requires an extra 70 beds and until these beds are provided, the hospital will continue to career from crisis to crisis, with the ultimate victims being the citizens of County Donegal. Provision for the extra beds could be made by providing an extra storey or two on the proposed new accident and emergency unit which is envisaged to be an independent block. We have listened long enough to daily bulletins about conditions in the hospital. We want to hear the decision to proceed to the next stage of planning for the proposed accident and emergency unit followed by the provision of the 70 extra beds.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other critical services that must also be provided in Letterkenny. Donegal cancer patients have to travel the long distance to Dublin to obtain radiation oncology treatment. This has resulted in some cancer sufferers in the county taking the drastic decision to have breast removal operations rather than face the gruelling journey to Dublin for radiation treatment. While there is an excellent day patient oncology unit in the hospital, there is no dedicated cancer unit for in-patients. This is unacceptable when one considers that in the most peripheral county in Ireland, there are 50 new breast cancer cases, 70 new bowel cancer cases and 80 new prostate cancer cases annually. Cancer treatment facilities need to be upgraded and the BreastCheck service made available immediately. We are not asking for special treatment for the people of Donegal, just equal treatment. I ask the Government to meet the needs of the county without further delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this issue and welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on the development of services at Letterkenny General Hospital on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision and development of services at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Health and Children is advised by the HSE that the increasing capacity pressures at Letterkenny have arisen both from the recruitment of additional consultants in recent years and as a consequence of advances in modern medicine which have resulted in greater life expectancy. The most recent consultant appointments to the hospital, including a consultant cardiologist, haematologist, oncologist, geriatrician and a consultant in respiratory medicine, have meant that more patients access more services locally. These developments are welcome but it is acknowledged that they have led to an increase in the local demand for services.</P>
        <P>To assist the hospital in addressing the issue of capacity, the Department gave approval in 2003 to the HSE north-western area to proceed with the planning of an extension to the emergency medicine department at Letterkenny. The HSE north-western area appointed a design team to carry out an option appraisal-feasibility study to determine the preferred location for the facility on the hospital site. The study, which examined eight options, has been completed and is under consideration by the HSE. The proposal also includes the provision of two &ldquo;shelled-out&rdquo; floors over the emergency medicine department for the future provision of up to 70 beds.</P>
        <P>The Minister has identified the delivery of emergency services as a priority area for attention. Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine departments reflect system-wide issues. It is, therefore, necessary to take a whole-system approach involving primary care, acute care, and sub-acute and community care in tackling the problems in emergency medicine departments.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, the Minister announced additional funding of &euro;70 million to implement a ten-point action plan to improve the delivery of emergency services. She has met senior management of the Health Service Executive and the Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure early implementation of these measures.</P>

      <sTitle>Pupil-Teacher Ratio.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter. It is particularly appropriate this week when the INTO <Col N="2028"/>invited Oireachtas Members to visit schools throughout the country to see at first hand the conditions therein.</P>
        <P>I and all my colleagues in County Clare believe that thousands of children in primary schools in Clare are in classes which are well in excess of the national average class size. The INTO recently carried out a survey in Clare primary schools that revealed from the 86% response that there are 93 primary classes there with 30 to 40 pupils, 12 primary classes with 35 pupils or more, and 3,500 Clare primary pupils in classes of 30 or over. Some 420 of these pupils are in classes of 35 or more and 800 are in multiple classes where the teacher must cope with up to four different classes in one overall class grouping.</P>
        <P>All this is happening at a time three years after the Government committed to a radical reduction in the size of primary classes in its programme for Government. In its programme the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government gave a commitment that it would introduce maximum class guidelines over five years which would ensure that the average size of classes for children under nine would be below the international best practice guideline of 1:20. Three years later, the Government has failed to take even one step towards reducing class sizes in primary schools by even the slightest amount.</P>
        <P>Last Monday, I and three of my Oireachtas colleagues visited Ballyea national school, which is very close to my parish. I was astonished to see at first hand the overcrowding in the classrooms. There were 35 children in one classroom that was less than well-ventilated, one of whom was a pupil in a wheelchair. The children were so close to each other that the teacher said that when one child coughed, every child picked up the infection. Even the teacher had very little space between the table and blackboard in which to manoeuvre.</P>
        <P>Young children need more scope. The teachers, who do an excellent job, informed us that it was impossible for them to teach the new curriculum where small classes and groups are required in the guidelines introduced by the Department of Education and Science. The new curriculum clearly states that all children have a right to access to the highest quality of education appropriate to their needs. This includes children with disabilities.</P>
        <P>I was further astonished to see that Ireland ranks second in the European Union on average class size, just behind Great Britain. This is unacceptable in an era when significant Government resources are available and there is under-spending in some Departments. Teachers and parents are entitled to the highest quality education and individual attention for their children. Adequate space in classrooms is the least we can expect. Pupils with special learning needs must be able to progress satisfactorily at their own pace. Unless class numbers are reduced, our children will suffer.</P><Col N="2029"/>
        <P>An additional 2,500 teachers will graduate this year from colleges. Some 1,700 of these could enter the system which would make a major difference towards reducing class numbers while 800 would go towards annual teacher replacements. The teachers are available and I urge the Minister to make the changes. We do not expect it to be done overnight as we know it cannot be done like that. If the Minister reduced class sizes, it would make a significant difference.</P>
        <P>During our briefing with the teachers in Ballyea school, many of them indicated they were frustrated with the class numbers and informed us that they could not achieve what they wanted with many children because of class size. They need more work space. Every pupil needs to get to know the teacher. Many teachers said they could not get to know their pupils on a one-to-one basis because of class size.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to begin the process of reducing class size numbers rather than reducing the pupil-teacher ratio, which is different. The Government must deliver on its pre-election promise because a good primary education for our young population is the foundation for our children&rsquo;s future. A sound education would also alleviate some of the social problems in towns and cities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Pat Breen for raising this matter. I am glad to have the opportunity to outline to the House the improvements that have been made in primary class sizes by the Government.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has dramatically increased the number of teachers in primary schools. In that time more than 4,000 additional teachers, including nearly 2,500 resource teachers, have been employed. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for children with special needs. Average class size has been reduced from 26.6 in 1996-97 to 23.9 in 2003-04. With regard to primary schools in County Clare, I am pleased to say that the average class size in the 2003-04 school year was 23.2.</P>
        <P>The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school, including resource and learning support teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.4:1 in 2003-04. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break and Breaking the Cycle programmes, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The staffing allocation system is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of more than 29, it is generally because a decision <Col N="2030"/>has been taken at local level to use teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes in the school. As a result of the decrease in the overall maximum class size by reference to the staffing schedule from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 currently, the number of children in classes of 30 or more has decreased substantially. In that regard, the average class size in the 30 to 39 category in 2003-04 was 31.7.</P>
        <P>Other improvements in staffing for primary schools in recent years include a reduction in the appointment and retention figure for the first mainstream class teacher to 12 pupils; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools with nine or more teachers, including ex-quota posts; a reduction in the enrolment figures required for the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools and Gaelscoileanna; the allocation of teaching posts to schools where 14 or more pupils with significant English language deficits are identified; and the allocation of additional learning support teachers.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, the Department of Education and Science will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes. Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Cheann Comhairle as deis a thabhairt dom labhairt faoi seo. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it fosta. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter. Many teaching posts in the special needs education sector are filled by post-primary teachers and untrained personnel. The sector suffers a high turnover of staff because many teachers find they are not suited for, or keen to do, such work given, that it is different from mainstream education or because their qualifications and experience are not fully recognised. Many teachers who have chosen a career in special needs education and who have a great deal of specialist training and experience behind them are not fully recognised by the Department as special needs teachers because they are not trained for the primary sector.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Department only considers primary or post-primary training in recognising special needs teachers. Part five of departmental circular 25/00 states the Department will offer &ldquo;restricted recognition to teachers with a recognised post-primary qualification to enable them to teach in special schools where a proportion of the pupils attending the special school are of post-primary age (i.e. 12 years or older) and where 2nd level programmes are being provided by the school e.g. Junior Certificate Elementary Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied Programme&rdquo;.</P><Col N="2031"/>
        <P>Part four of circular 25/00 states &ldquo;restricted recognition [is granted] to certain teachers who have a recognised primary teacher qualification from another jurisdiction&rdquo;, that is, those trained outside the state or those with a Montessori qualification. These teachers are qualified to teach four to 12 year olds in schools and classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement. These include schools and classes for pupils with severe and profound general learning disabilities, severe emotional disturbance and autistic spectrum disorders. In the UK, the DFEE confirmation of status for teachers states, &ldquo;QTS is non-subject and non-age range specific. You are therefore eligible to seek posts covering the range of National Curriculum Subjects.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Why is there not more flexibility in Ireland regarding the recognition of basic teacher training and qualifications for the employment of special needs teachers? Many &ldquo;unqualified&rdquo; teachers are in classrooms in the special needs sector in Ireland, particularly in classes of children with autistic spectrum disorders, which I highlight because a number of my constituents work in them. They are considered unqualified in that they are not primary trained. Many may be post-primary trained and may have plenty of specialist training and experience, yet they are not entitled to full recognition and permanent contracts.</P>
        <P>The education of these children is a specialist area and it requires much more training and experience than that provided in teacher training colleges. A few examples of the many special needs specific courses available both in Ireland and the UK, which have been taken by people who are teaching but not fully recognised, are PORTAGE, home teaching scheme for pre-school children with special educational needs and their families; PECS, picture exchange communication system; and TEACCH, treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children. It is time the Department adopted a more progressive approach and recognised training other than primary qualifications when it comes to special needs education.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it would be preferable if the Department concentrated on allocating primary trained teachers to mainstream primary posts and began to recognise those with specialist qualifications and experience as special needs teachers of any age and ability by allowing them to take up special education posts without restrictions. This way the need for investment in the retraining of teachers will lessen, staff turnover will reduce, there will be more continuity in the classroom and, consequently, the quality in the education of these children will improve.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to recognise that children with special needs need continuity in their education. A great disservice is being done to them, perhaps unwittingly, by the Department, which has created this unrecognised category of teachers who are expert in their field and highly <Col N="2032"/>specialised but who must seek jobs elsewhere because they do not meet the Department&rsquo;s narrow criteria or because their own jobs are advertised. The Minister should pay attention to this issue in the interest of children with special needs who require continuity.</P>
        <P>The irony is that teachers with post-primary qualifications are educating pupils with special needs who may be aged between 13 and 16 in primary schools but they are not recognised to teach children of post-primary age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I am glad to have the opportunity to provide clarity on the issue.</P>
        <P>Unqualified teachers should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs. The difficulties being experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career breaks and job sharing schemes.</P>
        <P>The Department introduced a range of measures to address the shortage of qualified teachers and I am pleased the number of unqualified teachers employed in our primary schools has reduced significantly as a result. Some of the initiatives taken since 1999 are as follows. More than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B Ed programme in the colleges of education; a postgraduate course was introduced; graduates of the Hibernia course are recognised for employment as primary teacher; B Ed graduates of St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications, are recognised as fully qualified; Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the three-year full-time course at St. Nicholas College, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as fully qualified substitute teachers and to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools; and fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State are recognised to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of recognition of qualifications, all applications for recognition are considered under the terms of circular 25/00 regarding recognition of teacher qualifications for the purposes of teaching in national schools, and are considered on a case by case basis. In accordance with the circular, where an applicant has a general primary teaching qualification from another jurisdiction, he or she may be entitled to <Col N="2033"/>recognition in a provisional and restricted capacity. This would entitle him or her to teach in mainstream classes in national schools, special classes and special schools and in resource teaching posts.</P>
        <P>While in Ireland qualifications in special education are undertaken at postgraduate level, it is recognised that in other jurisdictions a qualification in special education may be taken at undergraduate level. In processing applications for recognition, account of this position is taken and teachers holding such qualifications, following consideration of their individual cases, may be granted restricted recognition to work in certain categories of special schools and special classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement and in resource teaching posts in mainstream schools. The Minister is committed to ensuring the shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated as speedily as possible and her Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</P>

      <sTitle>School Absenteeism.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a specific issue. I want to know what the Minister intends to do in a general sense in terms of absenteeism. The school to which I refer is a second level college under the auspices of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee and the student is doing her junior certificate. The statistics are stark. In 2002, this student came into the college and was absent 90 days in that year. In 2003, she was absent for 121 days and up to Christmas 2004 she was absent for 60 days. That is 271 days out of 334 days she should have been in school, an absentee rate of over 80%. That situation has continued over three years, through first, second and third year.</P>
        <P>The student is currently in junior certificate class, when she is present in the school, and should be sitting the examination this year, yet the attendance roll for this girl is appalling. The staff have done everything in their power to try to get the young girl to attend school. It has initiated 21 different interventions. It has contacted the National Educational Welfare Board and I am aware educational welfare officers have done their best, but there has been no success in ensuring this young lady goes to school.</P>
        <P>What does the Minister for Education and Science propose to do about this matter? Everybody is totally frustrated and at their wits end. The student is very bright but she does not go to school. That is in breach of all the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but that Department does not appear to have an opinion on the matter. The school brought the problem to its attention and gave the whole appalling file to the Minister not long ago, but it has not received a response. What does the Minister intend to do about an appalling situation where a youngster is unable to avail of an education?</P>
        <P>The situation regarding the student is dire and one can imagine the impact it has on other <Col N="2034"/>students. They might say that this student is not attending school, nobody is doing anything about it and they might as well mitch from school. As a result, the attendance levels in that school are deteriorating because no action is being taken.</P>
        <P>We were told the National Educational Welfare Board, which replaced the role of the attendance officers and the Garda, would focus on ensuring that the emphasis would not be on penalising the student but on dealing with the parents. What action has been taken to ensure that the parents of that student will send her to school? I would welcome the Department of Education and Science giving an opinion and letting the school know the action it intends to take, how it can be supportive, whether it intends to fine the parent &mdash; under the legislation the parent could be put in jail &mdash; or whether it has some plan. The Department is standing idly by.</P>
        <P>The 23 vocational schools in Dublin had a meeting recently at which it was revealed that they are all suffering greatly from absenteeism. Last year&rsquo;s statistics from the National Educational Welfare Board show that there was approximately 25% prolonged absenteeism. It was revealed that 20 days in the year, one month&rsquo;s schooling, was the norm in disadvantaged areas. There was a somewhat lower level in middle class areas but the figure was high also.</P>
        <P>Students are supposed to be in full-time education up to the age of 16. This youngster is much younger than that and she has not had any decent education for the past three years. I want an answer to this issue and to the whole question of absenteeism, which is fairly rampant throughout many areas of Dublin. I am sure there is a problem in country areas also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Costello for raising this serious matter on the Adjournment. On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I will reply.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The overall authorised staffing complement is 94, comprising 16 HQ and support staff, five regional managers, 11 senior educational welfare <Col N="2035"/>officers and 62 educational welfare officers. I understand that some staff vacancies exist at present but that the board is in the process of making appointments which will bring the service delivery staff to its authorised complement.</P>
        <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an educational welfare service is now available, for the first time, in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. A total of 12 towns with significant school-going populations, 11 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the difficulties experienced in disadvantaged areas cannot be solved by one agency acting alone. Education is but one of the many needs of the people living in these areas. The board is working in close co-operation with other services from the education, health and justice areas so that children in need of special support are identified very early in their lives and followed up in a multi-disciplinary way. I have no doubt this service will help prevent children and young people becoming involved in delinquent and anti-social behaviour in the future.</P>
        <P>There are a range of schemes, initiatives and services dealing with educational disadvantage at primary and post-primary level. These include the school completion programme, the visiting teacher service for Travellers and the home-school-community liaison scheme. Each of these schemes contributes in a positive way to promoting the education of children and young people.</P>
        <P>The board consults schools, teachers, parents and others in regard to its services and has established a school implementation group to advise on its working arrangements with schools. The board has also moved to provide a service for families who decide to have their children educated in places other than recognised schools. The first assessments of education provided in places <Col N="2036"/>other than recognised schools have been carried out by three assessors appointed for this purpose. Work is continuing on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment. The board also ensures that information concerning the Act and the work of the board generally is made available to schools, parents and others as soon as possible. An introductory letter was issued to all schools in March 2004.</P>
        <P>Guidelines were issued by the NEWB to all primary and post-primary schools on 26 January 2005 on reporting student absences. The guidelines provide step-by-step advice on how and when school attendance returns should be made and how the new website, <i>www.schoolreturn.ie</i>, can be used by schools to comply with their legal obligations to report student absences to the board.</P>
        <P>The budget which has been allocated to the National Educational Welfare Board for 2005 is &euro;7.8 million, an increase of &euro;1.3 million, or 20%, on the 2004 allocation. The percentage increase allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the education Vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services during the year.</P>
        <P>In the summer of 2004 the board received the first comprehensive data returns from the schools which are assisting it to keep the level of need for the new service in certain areas under review. I will outline the principal findings of the report. Attendance is lower at post-primary level than at primary level. At primary level every student misses 11 days, on average, of a total of 183 days. At post-primary level every student misses 15 days, on average, of a total of 167 days. One in ten students is absent for 20 days or more at primary level. Almost one in five students is absent for 20 days or more at post-primary level. The rates I have outlined are similar to those in England.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the reply I am giving to the Deputy is of a general nature.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 28 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>My Department made a presentation on the draft ten year transport investment framework to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, housing and PPPs on 9 March and it is currently under consideration by the sub-committee. I have also sought the advice of the Attorney General on the possible application of the EU Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive to this investment framework. I will bring proposals to Government in due course once the Cabinet sub-committee has concluded its work and I have received and considered the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice. It is not possible to comment on the level of funding to be made available over the ten years pending a Government decision.</P>
        <P>The analysis of investment priorities is an ongoing feature of the work of my Department, particularly in the context of the multi-annual capital envelopes. This work is carried out in consultation with the agencies under the aegis of my Department and involves ongoing contacts and discussions with a wide range of other interested parties.</P>
        <P>The development of the draft investment framework commenced in the final months of 2004. It is taking account of the work already done on investment priorities under the current capital envelope to end 2009 and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the national road needs study. More specifically, my Department has engaged with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office in order to identify the broad direction and priorities under the ten year investment framework. My Department has also consulted with other Departments, primarily through the cross-departmental team of officials which supports the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
        <P>A small team of officials from my Department is developing the draft investment framework. The Department has not to date engaged any consultants to specifically assist or advise it in developing the draft framework. However, it is benefiting from the advice of Goodbody Economic Consultants, who were engaged before work on the investment framework commenced, to review the business cases submitted by CIE in <Col N="2039"/>support of various projects, including its greater Dublin integrated rail network proposals.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>Automated toll collection is currently in use on existing toll plazas and provides for one toll lane in each direction dedicated to the electronic collection of tolls. A physical barrier is used on the lanes to prevent non-payment of tolls. The only route where a move to full open road tolling, that is, no manual collection and barrier free, is being considered, is the M50. The move from the current toll arrangement on the M50 to a non-stop automated toll collection facility would be completed over a number of stages, involving a phased reduction in the cashier-coin basket lanes with a corresponding increase in payments by automated methods.</P>
        <P>The legislative changes necessary to facilitate the implementation of barrier free tolling on automated toll collection lanes on other toll schemes, through the implementation of appro<Col N="2040"/>priate deterrents for non payment of tolls, have been the subject of consultation with the National Roads Authority, NTR and other companies with an interest in the operation of toll plazas. I anticipate subject to the other priorities on the legislative programme, that the draft legislation will be introduced in autumn of this year.</P>

In parallel with the opening to traffic of the Dublin Port tunnel, Dublin City Council will introduce a heavy goods vehicle traffic management strategy to ensure that maximum traffic benefits are secured from the Dublin Port tunnel. This strategy has three objectives: to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the Dublin Port tunnel; to minimize adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city; and to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions.</P>
        <P>I understand from Dublin City Council that an implementation programme to facilitate the introduction of the HGV management strategy is currently being devised. This includes, <i>inter alia</i>, discussions with my Department regarding the <Col N="2041"/>regulatory provisions necessary to underpin the strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 56 together.</P>
        <P>Proposals in relation to the development of Dublin Airport, including the planning and provision of runway capacity, are in the first instance a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airport and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. The airport authority has submitted a planning application to Fingal County Council for a second parallel runway which is currently being processed by the planning authority.</P>
        <P>Dublin Airport will remain the country&rsquo;s main airport serving the needs not just of the travelling public in our capital city and the surrounding counties but also of the country&rsquo;s tourism, business and freight sectors generally. Notwithstanding the greatly welcome increase over recent years in traffic at Shannon and Cork airports, and to a lesser extent at the regional airports, Dublin Airport will remain crucial to the national economy. In this regard, passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is expected to grow from over 17 million last year to an estimated 23 million in 2009 and is forecast to increase to 30 million by around 2017.</P>
        <P>It is also noteworthy that the national spatial strategy has acknowledged that the expansion of the level of air services from Dublin Airport to a wider range of destinations is essential in the interests of underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s future international competitiveness. Yesterday I met representatives of the community-based organisation, UPROAR, United Portmarnock Residents Opposing Another Runway, who have concerns in relation to the proposed second parallel runway at Dublin Airport. In essence, the residents&rsquo; organisation believes that the growth of Dublin Airport should be effectively capped and that further growth in Dublin-based air traffic should be catered for by a new airport on a greenfield site or through increased utilisation of the regional airports.</P><Col N="2042"/>
        <P>I do not believe that this suggestion is either feasible or practicable. As the economy grows, our infrastructure development has to keep pace so that new bottlenecks do not emerge in the transport system. Dublin Airport has considerable scope and capacity to expand to cater for future growth in air traffic for the foreseeable future and accordingly Dublin does not need a second airport. The lands necessary for the new runway began to be acquired in the late 1960s and, as far back as 1972, the then Dublin County Council included the proposed new runway in the county development plan.</P>
        <P>The residents&rsquo; organisation also has concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the proposed second parallel runway. I understand from the Dublin Airport Authority that the environmental impact statement, EIS, which accompanied the planning application describes the existing environment and the impacts of the development are explained by reference to its possible impact on a series of environmental topics, that is, people, plants, animals, soils, water, air, landscape, etc., and on material assets including architectural, archaeological heritage and cultural heritage. The EIS also outlines the company&rsquo;s plans to manage and mitigate any such impacts.</P>
        <P>The current planning process provides the appropriate forum for all interested parties, including local communities and residents, to have their views and concerns on the proposed new runway heard and taken into account by the planning authorities.</P>

	<P>Car sharing clubs involve individuals or businesses paying a membership fee to join a club and some combination of a flat rate per hour or a per mile fee or both for the use of a vehicle. Vehicles are parked in strategic, convenient locations around cities, in which this scheme operates, and reserved ahead of time. The car sharing company or organisation pays for the car, fuel, maintenance, repairs, insurance, parking and cleaning. It is a concept that is gaining in popularity in some major cities in the USA. I have asked the DTO to brief my Department on the potential for such an initiative in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 46 together.</P>
        <P>Significant investment has been made to date under the national development plan in acquiring new buses for Dublin Bus. In addition, significant Exchequer funding has been provided for a new depot for these buses. As a consequence, the capacity of the fleet has been increased by nearly 25% since 1999 and the company is now carrying approximately 150 million passengers per annum.</P>
        <P>Given the demands on the multi-annual capital budget negotiated by my Department with the Department of Finance, prudent management requires that my Department is satisfied regarding the utilisation of existing resources before considering additional funding. In this context, the management of Dublin Bus is currently examining ways of maximising the utilisation of the bus fleet, in light of the significant investment made to date under the NDP in other modes such as Luas, suburban rail and the DART upgrade, and I am awaiting the outcome of this review. I am confident that the management of Dublin Bus is progressing this review as a priority.</P>
        <P>Given the significant expansion of public transport in Dublin which has already taken place and is planned under A Platform for Change, it is appropriate, at this stage, to consider also how best to give effect to the expansion of the bus services having regard to the requirement for an integrated public transport network in the greater Dublin area. In addition, I am also of the view that both Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and private companies have a continuing role to play in meeting the expanding transport requirements of the greater Dublin area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 27, 30 and 33 together.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the provisions of the State Airports Act 2004 the board of the Dublin Airport Authority has a statutory mandate to do everything necessary to give effect to the restructuring of the State airports.</P>
        <P>The Shannon and Cork airport authorities were incorporated in October 2004 and in line with the framework provided by the State Airports Act 2004, these two new authorities will, in due course, own and operate their respective airports once sufficient distributable reserves are available to transfer the relevant assets.</P>
        <P>Prior to the assets of Shannon and Cork airports being vested in their respective authorities, their boards are charged with preparing to assume full responsibility for the management and development of their airports. They are also <Col N="2045"/>empowered to undertake functions delegated to them, on an agreed basis, by the Dublin Airport Authority. Each of the airport authorities are also required to prepare comprehensive business plans for their airports. As part of this process the Dublin Airport Authority will be considering the future direction of its business, including the position of its subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the 2004 Act, the transfer of assets to Shannon and Cork airport authorities cannot take place earlier than 30 April 2005 and, thereafter, a phased approach will allow one of the new airport authorities to be vested first, that is, Shannon Airport, while Cork Airport will be vested once sufficient distributable reserves have been built up within the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>Both I and the Minister for Finance must be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the Shannon and Cork airport authorities before the assets of the airports are vested in those authorities. The formulation of comprehensive business plans by the new boards will be a key aspect of achieving operational and financial readiness.</P>
        <P>The boards and managements of all three airport authorities, including Shannon, are currently preparing business plans for submission to the Ministers for Transport and Finance. A finalised business plan for Shannon has not yet been discussed with my officials but as required my officials keep in touch with the authority on progress. My understanding is that the Shannon Airport Authority will be looking to finalise its business plan as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The overall business planning process will entail a concerted approach by the three airport authorities. The business plans will be the subject of consultations with stakeholders, including union representatives.</P>
        <P>As regards the possibility of merging Shannon Development and the Shannon airport authority, a working group was established by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year to consider options for how Shannon Development and the Shannon airport authority can best contribute to the development of the mid west region. While consideration has been given to a range of options no decision has been taken on a possible merger of Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development.</P>
        <P>There is no proposal under consideration at present for the introduction of a public service obligation, PSO, regime in relation to air services between Shannon and the United States. Such an arrangement would not be permitted under the existing EU regulations governing PSOs which relate solely to intra-regional air services within the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While there has been a significant decline in the number of bicycles crossing the canal cordon inbound during the morning peak, this has to be seen in the wider context of a decline in most modes of transport crossing the cordon, including the private car. The bus is the only mode to have shown a consistent increase. The reduction in the mode share of cycling, notwithstanding greatly improved provision for cyclists, probably reflects a long-term trend, influenced by a number of factors, including: increased car ownership, increased affluence, access to additional public transport options, the ageing of the population, and a perception, especially on the part of parents, that cycling in the city is relatively unsafe.</P>
        <P>The decline in cycling as a mode of travel to school has been an important factor in the overall reduction in cycling. The safer routes to school pilot projects co-ordinated through the Dublin Transportation Office have included schools where the use of bicycle was identified as part of the solution. While there is a positive disposition towards the bicycle, for example, inclusion of parent-financed on-road cycle training as part of the school curriculum, and significant expenditure on bicycle facilities, this has not translated itself into additional bicycle trips in these schools. I have asked the DTO to provide a comprehensive report on these pilots, in order that multi-departmental actions can be identified in relation to sustainable healthy school travel.</P>
        <P>It is not at all clear that the perception that cycling is relatively unsafe is correct. The trend in cycling fatalities in the city council area over the period 1997 to 2003 has been encouraging. According to statistics provided by the National Roads Authority, there were cycling fatalities in 1997 but none in 2003. Figures for 2004 have yet to be published.</P>
        <P>It is generally accepted that there were design problems with cycle facilities implemented some years ago. However, the standard of new cycle facilities has improved very significantly over recent years. The DTO is currently working on a new guidance manual for cycle facilities. This version will address changes in legislation and traffic management in the period since 1997. However, research being conducted by the Dublin City Council on the factors that influence the decision of Dublin commuters to cycle or not to cycle suggests that the presence or absence of these facilities may not be the most important factor.</P><Col N="2047"/>
        <P>The emerging implications for policy are that a more holistic approach, which involves addressing their real and perceived safety concerns of potential cyclists, is called for in order to create an attractive environment for cyclists. In the light of this, I will be asking the DTO to advise on the future direction of cycling policy for the greater Dublin area.</P>

        <P>The Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 1997 to 2005 prescribe regulatory traffic signs, which include upright signs, road markings, traffic lights, and other devices which may be provided on roads by road authorities, to indicate the existence of a road regulation, to implement such a regulation, or to indicate the existence of a provision in an enactment relating to road traffic.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the provision, positioning and maintenance of all traffic signs on non-national roads, which include regulatory signs and road markings, warning and information signs, is a matter for individual road authorities. Responsibility for funding the provision and maintenance of traffic signs on the national roads network is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>The traffic signs manual 1996 sets out directions given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport pursuant to section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 regarding the provision and use of warning and information traffic signs including directional information signs.

	<P>A fundamental goal of the major investment that the Government is making in public transport is to bring about a modal shift from the private car, particularly for peak period commuting in major urban areas. This is being done by expanding capacity, improving utilisation and enhancing the quality of the public transport system.</P>
        <P>Park and ride facilities are being developed to attract car commuters onto public transport. In Cork, a major bus-based park and ride facility has recently been developed with funding from my Department and is proving very successful. In Dublin rail-based park and ride facilities have already been developed at a number of DART, suburban rail and Luas stations. Furthermore, the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, working group on rail-based park and ride has developed a strategy for the provision of park and ride facilities at a number of locations on the existing and proposed rail network within the greater Dublin area, and has also proposed an evaluation methodology to assess the suitability of any future proposals. I am currently considering the final report detailing the locations, and factors to be considered when progressing the implementation of such facilities. Moreover, a tax incentive scheme to stimulate investment in park and ride facilities has been in place for some time.</P>
        <P>Bus routes serving railway stations or Luas stops and dedicated feeder bus services provide an important link to rail services for commuters. However, it is a matter for bus and rail operators to plan and implement such services</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>At present, the penalty points system that is provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002 applies to four road traffic offences, namely, the offences of exceeding a speed limit, non-compliance with safety belt requirements, using a vehicle without insurance and careless driving.</P>
        <P>For the offence of exceeding a speed limit, a driver will incur four penalty points on conviction in court or two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge. For the offence of not wearing a safety belt, a driver will incur four penalty points on conviction in court or two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge. For permitting a person under 17 years to occupy a rear seat when not wearing a safety belt or appropriate child restraint, a driver will incur four penalty points on conviction in court or two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge. For permitting a person under 17 years to occupy a front seat when not wearing a safety belt or appropriate child restraint, a driver will incur four penalty points on conviction in court or two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge. For the offence of <Col N="2050"/>using a vehicle without insurance, a driver will incur five penalty points on conviction in court. For the offence of careless driving, a driver will incur five penalty points on conviction in court.</P>
        <P>All of the road traffic offences that are scheduled to come within the ambit of the penalty points system, together with details of the number of penalty points attaching to each offence, are set out in the First Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2002 and in the amendment inserted therein by section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The operation of the fixed charge system, provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002, is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is expected to have the new system available during the summer. Regulations to support the extension of the fixed charge and penalty points systems, as applicable, to a wide range of offences will be put in place when the new IT system comes on stream.</P>

	<P>The programme for Government emphasised the importance of competitive access maritime transport and of ensuring that our ports are equipped for the demands of our growing economy through investment in and development of seamless transport systems between all modes. This has been pursued, in the case of Dublin, for example, by Government investment in major projects such as the Dublin Port tunnel, the M50 and its projected <Col N="2051"/>upgrade and the improvement of traffic management in the greater Dublin area generally. In its follow up to the Government&rsquo;s port policy statement, published in January last, which identifies, <i>inter alia</i>, the timely provision of adequate port capacity as a key challenge the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is now consulting with the commercial ports to determine their view of port capacity and how they intend to deal with projected capacity requirements. That Department is seeking to identify key port developments which are essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond.</P>
        <P>In line with the ports policy statement, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will co-ordinate with my Department in evaluating such projects in order to ensure an integrated transport policy approach is adopted.</P>
        <P>My Department has not commented or made submissions on the development of the south docks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Road Traffic Act 1961, it is an offence to &ldquo;use in a public place a mechanically propelled vehicle unless ... there is in force at that time an approved policy of insurance&rdquo;. Penalties provided for include a maximum fine of &euro;2,500, the imposition of five penalty points and the impounding of the vehicle. Enforcement is a matter for the Garda, including members of the traffic corps.</P>
        <P>Government policy in respect of the cost and availability of motor insurance is to implement the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board as set out in its first and final reports. Substantial progress has already been made on the recommendations including the introduction of the PIAB and the Civil Liability and Courts Act. The Central Statistics Office consumer price index shows that the cost of motor insurance has fallen by nine percentage points during the last calendar year and, since April 2003, the cost of motor insurance has fallen by 21%.</P>
        <P>I propose to ask my Department officials to follow up on the outstanding MIAB recommendations and also to examine the recently published <Col N="2052"/>Competition Authority report with a view to sustaining and building on progress to date.</P>

A number of measures in this Act are provided to support the enforcement of a range of road traffic offences. When the text of the Act was being finalised, it was anticipated that the ruling referred to by the Deputy could emerge from the courts and section 15 of the Act has addressed the issue which was the subject of the ruling. Road traffic legislation is subjected to challenge from time to time and the interpretation of legislative provisions is ultimately a matter for the courts.</P>

        <P>The issuing of guidelines by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will provide an opportunity for public consultation on those guidelines.

	<P>Statistics relating to road accidents, based on information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are published by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in its annual road accident facts reports. The most recent report, Road Collision Facts, relates to 2003 and is available on the NRA website. <Col N="2054"/>Reports relating to previous years are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The Road Collision Facts 2003 publication indicates that there were a total of 301 fatal collisions and 5,684 injury collisions in that year, of which 63 fatal collisions and 2,011 injury collisions were at junctions. The reports, however, do not contain details of collisions which occur specifically at junctions with housing developments.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of the National Roads Authority to seek to restrict direct access onto national roads in order to protect the substantial investment already made in the network, to improve carrying capacity and safety and to prevent the premature obsolescence of the network.</P>
        <P>Under Part 4, Article 28 (<i>j</i>)(i)(ii) of the 2001 planning and development regulations, notification of planning applications which involve a new access or material widening of an access to an existing or planned national road or where the development might give rise to a significant increase in the volume of traffic using a national road, must be sent to the National Roads Authority. The authority may make submissions or observations on such planning applications in accordance with Article 29 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>The upgrade of the national road network, involving as it does the provision of motorway or dual carriageway standard road on the major inter-urban routes and the provision of two plus one roads on other routes, will improve safety standards through the elimination of right-turning movements. Traffic calming schemes and better arrangements such as dedicated lanes where practicable, for right-turning traffic being implemented as part of the roads upgrade programme is also assisting in improving safety levels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 325 of 22 March 2005, which stated: I am aware of the views of the Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA, on the Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, formerly Aer Rianta, pension scheme for general employees. These pensioners are seeking enhanced benefits under the scheme, that is, guaranteed CPI and salary indexation. However, pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and the DAA, are primarily matters for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company or companies involved.</P>
        <P>The pension scheme in question, the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme, is a multi-employer scheme which, in addition to Aer Lingus and DAA staff, also includes a private sector company, SR Technics, <Col N="2055"/>formerly FLS Aerospace. A key issue is that the scheme cannot be amended without the consent of all participating employers and a majority of members. This means that no employer is in a position to negotiate exclusively with its employees as to their pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>The rules of the scheme do not provide for automatic pension increases in line with salary movements or the CPI. However, the practice by the trustees under the scheme has been to provide increases in line with the CPI to pensions in payment. These increases are not guaranteed and not explicitly funded but depend on the performance of the pension fund and are paid at the discretion of the trustees of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Numerous meetings have taken place between RASA representatives and the companies and also with previous Ministers and officials from my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance to discuss this matter. I met representatives of the group on 19 January 2005. Despite detailed examination, there has been no obvious solution to the RASA concerns. However, I indicated at that meeting that I would keep the matter under review with the companies concerned.</P>
        <P>Legislation has been put in place to enable both Aer Lingus and the DAA to establish new pension schemes for their own employees and pensioners. This was provided for in the Aer Lingus Act 2004 and the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, as amended by the State Airports Act 2004. However, it is a matter for the companies concerned to decide if and when a new pension scheme, or schemes, are to be established and the terms of any such schemes would be a matter for consultation with unions. The normal arrangement where pension schemes of State bodies must be approved by the Minister for Transport, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, will continue to apply. There is no guarantee that RASA&rsquo;s concerns can be addressed in any new schemes that might be established.</P>
        <P>In the event of any new scheme or schemes being established, the Acts referred to previously provide that existing pensioners who come within the scope of the existing scheme will be transferred to the new scheme, unless they elect to remain in the existing scheme. The Acts also ensure that the benefits granted under such a new scheme, or schemes, shall not be less than those granted under the existing scheme.</P>

        <QRef>[9684/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The aim of EuroRAP is to improve road safety by assessing risks and identifying shortcomings on national road networks across Europe that can be addressed with practical road improvement measures. This is a commendable goal and I therefore welcome the publication of its recent report on the state of Ireland&rsquo;s major national roads. I note that the NRA made a very substantial contribution to the preparation of this report.</P><Col N="2058"/>
        <P>The EuroRAP report found that the safety performance of the Irish major road network is broadly the same as other countries they have studied, such as the Netherlands, Britain and Sweden. The average fatal collision rate on Ireland&rsquo;s motorways shows that they are about as safe as those in Britain. The British rate is only slightly higher than that in Sweden and the Netherlands, but all are lower than the rate in Spain.</P>
        <P>In general the safest types of roads are motorways but, because there are currently relatively fewer miles of motorway in Ireland than in other countries, there are fewer sections of the safest category or low risk road in Ireland than in the other countries studied. However, this will change with the substantial investment being made in improving our national road network over the next few years. Over &euro;8 billion will be spent on the network over the period 2005-09. I expect there to be a very significant road safety dividend associated with this increased investment.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the NRA is already working on addressing many of the specific deficiencies identified by the EuroRAP report. This year alone almost &euro;54 million will be spent by the NRA on road maintenance and &euro;40 million will be spent on a range of road safety measures.</P>
        <P>However, I must emphasise that behavioural issues and not road conditions continue to be the single biggest contributory factor to road collisions. Analysis of factors contributing to fatal and injury accidents in 2002 indicate that the key contributory factors are driver behaviour, comprising 86%, and pedestrian behaviour, comprising<?oasys _jy?>9.7%, whereas road factors were identified as contributory factors in only 2.5% of fatal and serious accident collisions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 57 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>Passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is forecast to grow from last year&rsquo;s level of over 17 million passengers to 30 million by around 2018. New infrastructure capacity and facilities, both airside and landside, will be needed to cater for this growth including further terminal capacity. The issue at this point is how best to ensure that additional capacity is provided to meet passenger growth.</P>
        <P>With regard to pier D, as the Deputy is aware, my predecessor directed the former Aer Rianta not to make any irrevocable commitments on that proposed facility until further notice. In part, that was due to the linkage between the provision of further pier capacity and the concept of a second independent terminal at Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>Recognising that an early decision is desirable in relation to these matters so that, regardless of how it is provided, adequate terminal capacity is <Col N="2060"/>in place at Dublin Airport when required to meet the growth in passenger traffic, I am currently finalising proposals that I will bring to Government very shortly. My objective in putting proposals to Government will be to ensure the provision of terminal and pier capacity on an efficient, cost effective basis. Once the Government decision is made, the detailed planning and implementation process will address the location of a new terminal at the airport.</P>

	<P>New rights for passengers under Regulation 261/2004 came into force automatically in every EU member state on 17 February 2005. Passengers are now automatically entitled to compensation from an airline, depending on the circumstances, in the event of a long delay, cancellation at short notice or if denied boarding. Passengers should apply directly to the airline concerned for compensation.</P>
        <P>No Irish legislation is required to confer these passenger rights, which come into being on foot of the EU regulation directly, but each member state is required to designate a body responsible for the enforcement of the regulation. A passenger may complain to that body if he or she is not getting the assistance he or she is entitled to from air carriers.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising its consideration of transposition of the EU regulation, including the drafting of the necessary statutory instrument which will provide for designation of a body responsible for enforcement. Under the draft statutory instrument, the designated body will have the power to prosecute any airline that it considers is not complying with the EU regulation. Passengers may bring legal action against the airlines to obtain compensation if it is not forthcoming from the airline.</P>

        <P>The study concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital transfer service would be appropriate in an all-island context. Inter-hospital air ambulance services are currently provided by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard, subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to liaise with the Department of Defence on the preparation of a service level agreement which will formalise arrangements for the future provision of an air ambulance service by the Air Corps. It is expected that this work will be completed shortly.

Each of the new helicopters will have a specific air ambulance capability and the new fleet will have a far greater flying capacity than is available currently.

	<P>The arrangements for the co-ordination of social security systems, including health care benefits, among EU member states are set out in EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72. Persons covered by these regulations who are residing or staying in Ireland are entitled, free of charge, to all health care provided for by Irish legislation, where the cost of this treatment is payable by the institution of a member state other than Ireland.</P>
        <P>In general, this means that a person residing in Ireland and in receipt of a contributory social security payment from the UK or indeed any other member state, may receive a medical card under EU regulations, where they are not also in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs or employed in Ireland and subject to PRSI.</P>
        <P>Non-contributory social security payments are not usually exportable under the regulations, that is to say, such payments cease when the recipient has transferred residence from the country making the payment. An individual who was receiving such payments and to whom these payments were no longer being paid on taking up residence in Ireland would therefore be subject to the standard means test for a medical card in these circumstances. On joining the EU, the arrangements for the co-ordination of Ireland&rsquo;s social security system including health care benefits with those of the other member states were agreed under the terms of EU Regulation 1408/71.</P>
        <P>The form E119 provides cover for persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, and their dependants, who go to another member state looking for work. This cover is provided by the sickness institution of that country and the form is available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The E119 provides for medical cover similar to that received by a medical card holder while unemployment benefits are being transferred.</P>

	<P>Following legal advice from the Attorney General, in relation to the legal basis for charging for in-patient services in publicly-funded long-stay institutions, my Department issued instructions to all health boards and the ERHA to cease imposing any such charges pend<Col N="2063"/>ing the introduction of the appropriate legislation. This resulted in an estimated loss of income in the region of &euro;2 million per week and it was important that this source of income be secured as it is applied towards health services exclusively and does not revert to the Exchequer. Emergency legislation in the form of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 was therefore prepared, to provide a legal basis for charging for in-patient services in long-stay institutions, to secure this income. Given the requirement for urgent legislation and the limited timeframe involved it was not possible to enter into an extensive consultation process.</P>
        <P>The decision of the Supreme Court of 16 February 2005 brought clarity to the matter and paved the way for the introduction of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005 as the court did not find the provisions to provide for prospective charges of in-patients to be repugnant to the Constitution. The court stated, &ldquo;In authorising the Minister to impose charges on the specified category of person, the Oireachtas clearly intended that the resources of the health boards would benefit so as to better enable them to provide the services in question while at the same time seeking to avoid doing so in a manner which would cause undue hardship&rdquo;. The court also pointed out &ldquo;It was clearly the intention of the Oireachtas that any charges would not cause undue hardship generally or in individual cases and no doubt that is why it fixed the maximum charge at 80% of the pension&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Governments going back over 30 years have supported and implemented the policy of requiring some contribution towards shelter and maintenance of people with full eligibility in long-stay care institutions. I intend to meet the National Council on Ageing and Older People and groups representing older people in the near future to discuss the repayments scheme and other aspects of policy on long term care.</P>

	<P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, HSE, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for audiology services.</P>
        <P>The former Eastern Regional Health Authority conducted a pilot project to evaluate the appropriateness of introducing digital and digitally programmable hearing aids into the community audiology service. The project commenced in 2001 and a final report was produced in 2003. Staff training was provided as part of the pilot project; digital and digitally programmable hearing aids were issued to a selected number of people with hearing loss. In 2003, digitally programmable hearing aids were introduced in the former health boards and continue to be supplied by the community audiology service.</P>
        <P>The report on the pilot project concluded that in order to introduce digital hearing aids into the community audiology service, a number of factors need to be considered. All staff engaged in hearing aid fitting would require training and updating in order to use the new technology. Appropriate technology would have to be provided to staff in order to carry out the correct programming of hearing aids. In addition, in the event of new technology being introduced, hearing aid fitting appointments would be more prolonged than at present with the possibility of longer waiting times.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the HSE that a tendering process for the supply of hearing aids, both analogue and digital, has just been completed by the national audiology service. The Department has been further informed that staff are currently being trained to work with the new hearing aids.</P>

	<P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, the Medical Council is the statutory body charged with primary responsibility for the registration and regulation of medical practitioners. Doctors wishing to practice medicine in Ireland, including those wishing to establish themselves in general practice, should be registered with the Medical Council.</P>
        <P>UK and other EU trained doctors with the appropriate qualifications enjoy the same rights as Irish trained doctors, providing they meet the requirements of Directive 93/16/EEC, to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.</P>
        <P>A significant review of the Medical Practitioners Act has been undertaken by my Department and a new Medical Practitioners Bill is being drafted at present. As part of the changes proposed, a scheme of competence assurance, to be administered by the Medical Council, will be enshrined in legislation. The aim of the scheme is to ensure that doctors in independent practice, including general practitioners, will maintain their knowledge, skills and competence throughout their working lives.</P><Col N="2070"/>
        <P>General practitioner services are provided to eligible public patients under the general medical services, GMS, scheme on the basis of a contract agreed with the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation, and the Department of Health and Children. The GMS GP contract includes provisions for the filling of vacant positions or for creating new posts. Under the terms of the contract, the final decision in respect of new or vacant posts rests with the chief officer of the relevant Health Service Executive areas on foot of a consultative process. The GMS GP contract also provides for the recruitment of partners and assistants, with a view to partnership. All appointments in respect of vacancies, new posts, partners and assistants, with a view to partnership, are made by open competition following advertisement and competitive interview. The HSE will be requested to forward information directly to the Deputy in respect of the number of new positions approved by chief officers in each of the past five years.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that, with the introduction of enhanced medical card eligibility in 1999 and full medical card eligibility in 2001, for persons aged 70 and over, one-off entry arrangements were agreed between the IMO and the Department of Health and Children to allow GPs treating such patients to qualify to provide services under the GMS scheme.</P>

	<P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, the Medical Council is the statutory body charged with primary responsibility for the regulation and registration of medical practitioners. All doctors wishing to practise medicine in this country should be registered with the Medical Council. The Medical Council sets out the relevant qualifications, training and experience required for registration.</P>
        <P>The national hospitals office, Comhairle, informed me that on 22 March 2005 the number of approved hospital consultant posts was 1,947. These posts are divided into medical specialties as follows: anaesthesia 287; emergency medicine 52; medicine 378; obstetrics and gynaecology 104; paediatrics 108; pathology 176; psychiatry 295; radiology 183; and surgery 364.</P>
        <P>Staffing levels are set following detailed analysis of current staffing, workload, casemix, existing work practices and resource requirements in each specialty and sub-specialty. Service needs are influenced by many factors, including the nature <Col N="2071"/>and frequency of disease and disorders, population demographics, available therapy and service provision. Detailed policy advice on the organisation and operation of hospital services is formulated by national committees or advisory groups established by the Minister for Health and Children, the national hospitals office &mdash; Comhairle, individual specialty associations and training bodies.</P>
        <P>It is Government policy to substantially increase the number of consultants in the next decade. All non-consultant hospital doctors are given the opportunity of proper skills development on the basis that many in this category will be the consultants of tomorrow. There is a need for the development of a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning. This should be aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. Planning for the development of new and existing services must be based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services. The way forward is to have enhanced skills mixes by matching skills to service needs, which will subsequently benefit patients and empower health personnel to reach their full potential. This optimises their contribution to quality health care. The continued implementation of the action plan for people management has a crucial role to play in improving retention and reducing the turnover of skilled staff. In addition, the Health Service Executive will be centrally involved in the development of an integrated workforce planning strategy for the health sector.</P>

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for disability services.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, in his 2005 budget, made available additional funding of &euro;55 million for services to persons with an intellectual, physical or sensory disability and those with autism. Additional capital funding of &euro;34 million has also been provided in 2005.</P>
        <P>When launching the national disability strategy, the Taoiseach announced the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a multi-annual investment programme for disability services over the next five years, details of which were announced on budget day. The investment programme for disability specific services will have a total cumulative value of &euro;900 million for the period 2006 to 2009. It will be a matter for the Health Service Executive to allocate this funding.</P>

	<P>A Bill to amend the Ombudsman Act is being prepared, which is intended,<i> inter alia</i>, to extend the Ombudsman&rsquo;s existing remit to a number of public institutions, including the universities.</P>
        <P>Under the existing Ombudsman Act, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate an administrative decision taken by a body listed in a Schedule to the Act, where such decision aggrieves a person in his or her individual capacity and falls into various categories of misbehaviour.</P>
        <P>The universities are not among the bodies covered by the Act at present. However, in 1999, the Government approved the draft scheme of an Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, which listed the universities among the bodies to be brought under the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>It is expected that this would be given effect shortly after the Bill, which is expected to be published in mid-2005, is enacted. Making the universities subject to the Act does not, however, mean that all disputes between students and the universities will be investigated by the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman may only investigate an administrative action and certain actions by universities, including exams and other academic assessments, may fall outside that definition. The Ombudsman is also precluded from investigating administrative actions where there is an independent appeals body to deal with them. The universities have established, or are understood to be establishing, independent appeals facilities covering much of their operations.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the body that represents the heads of the universities was unaware that it had been decided to bring the universities within the Ombudsman Act in 1999. In that context, they were surprised when the Department of Education and Science approached them, as a result of a query by our Parliamentary Counsel before Christmas, about activities such as campus companies which it would be appropriate to exclude. The universities would prefer to keep the Ombudsman away, on the grounds that students are members of their university and may seek a meeting to establish the details of what will be covered.</P>

	<P>The stamp duty code does not provide exemptions based on an individual&rsquo;s particular circumstances and introducing such a provision would represent a significant departure from normal stamp duty rules. If such an exemption were introduced, other special cases would demand similar treatment, which would lead to a narrowing of the stamp duty base. This would run counter to the Government&rsquo;s taxation policy of having a wide tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>Stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer and stamp duty receipts allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible.

Where a new dwelling is bought or built, a maximum grant of &euro;12,700 is payable. In the case of adaptation of an existing dwelling, 90% of the approved cost of the work is available, up to an effective maximum grant of &euro;20,320.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of provisions in the tax code to deal with offsetting losses incurred by farmers in a tax year.</P>
        <P>Section 381 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 permits a person chargeable to income tax who suffers a loss in a trade or profession, including farming, to set off the amount of the loss against income from all sources for the relevant tax year. Relief may only be claimed under this section in respect of a tax loss sustained in the tax year for which the claim is made. This set off against income from all sources has the effect of reducing the taxpayer&rsquo;s total taxable income for the year a claim for relief is made under this section. To the extent that the recalculation shows an over payment of tax, the taxpayer is entitled to a repayment. A claim to loss relief under this provision may be either created or augmented by claiming capital allowances to increase the quantum of the loss. Loss relief under this section can be claimed not only against the income of the lossmaker, but also against the income of that person&rsquo;s spouse, in the year of loss, provided the couple is not treated separately for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the option of setting losses against other income in the year in which a loss is incurred, a taxpayer, including a farmer, may decide instead to carry losses forward, under section 382 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, for relief in a later tax year. In that event, the loss may only be set against subsequent taxable profits from the same trade or profession. There is no time limit on how far forward losses can be brought, provided the same trade continues in existence. Relief under section 382 is only available to the extent that the loss has not been offset against other income under section 381. The relief is given from the profits of the first subsequent year of assessment, with any balance being carried forward and set against the profits of the next subsequent year of assessment and so on.</P>
        <P>Section 385 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that where a trade or profession, including farming, is permanently discontinued and a loss is suffered immediately before the time of the discontinuance, then the amount of that loss may be set against other income from that <Col N="2076"/>same trade or profession for the three years prior to the year of cessation, with later years being relieved before earlier years.</P>
        <P>The general rules outlined above apply equally to farming, subject to certain restrictions for persons not farming on a commercial basis.</P>
        <P>There are no proposals to amend the current tax treatment of losses arising from farming as the legislation covering such treatment of losses makes adequate provision for farmers. In addition, there is a generous package of reliefs and specific arrangements that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector. These include income averaging; stock relief; accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred on farm buildings; accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred on certain pollution control measures; capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the purchase of milk quota; an exemption from income tax for certain income from certain leased farmland; and special tax treatment in respect of profits accruing as a result of the disposal of stock under statutory disease eradication measures. Furthermore, certain young trained farmers can also qualify for full relief from stamp duty on the transfer of land and can also avail of enhanced stock relief of 100%.</P>

	<P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme is open to people with disabilities who meet the specified criteria and have obtained a primary medical certificate to that effect. The senior area medical officer attached to the relevant local health board is responsible for both the medical assessment and the issuing of the medical certificate.</P>
        <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disability are as follows: Persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; per<Col N="2077"/>sons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P>An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria, as set out above, is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate qualifies the holder for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax, VRT, a repayment of value added tax, VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle and a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental review group was established to review the disabled drivers&rsquo; and disabled passengers&rsquo; tax concessions scheme. The group&rsquo;s report examined all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. The report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004 and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. I will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context, having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>There have been no recent changes restricting the qualifying medical criteria for the scheme, as suggested in the question. Indeed, the most recent change to the qualifying medical criteria, in 1994, extended the medical criteria.</P>

	<P>The special savings incentive accounts scheme commenced in May 2001 and entry to the scheme closed in April 2002. The scheme is a five year savings scheme in which the Exchequer tops up, by way of a tax credit, subscriptions by an individual to his or her SSIA. The accounts mature at the end of the five <Col N="2078"/>year period and, provided the individual saver complies with certain conditions laid down in the legislation governing the scheme, the only tax liability which the account will attract will be a once-off tax of 23% on the profit earned from the investment both of the subscriptions and of the Exchequer tax credit.</P>
        <P>Where savers fail to comply with the conditions of the scheme the SSIA is treated as ceasing and all the money in the account is taxed at 23%.</P>
        <P>One of the conditions contained in the SSIA legislation is that, in order for an account to mature, account holders must make a maturity declaration, called an SSIA4, to their financial institution at any time within a period of three months ending on the maturity date. These maturity dates will arise at the end of each month during the period 31 May 2006 to 30 April 2007.</P>
        <P>The savers must declare that at all times in the period from the date on which their SSIA started until the date the declaration is made, they were the beneficial owner of the assets in the SSIA; had only one SSIA; were resident or ordinarily resident in the State; subscribed to the SSIA from funds available to them, or their spouse, without recourse to borrowings or the deferral of repayment, whether of capital or interest, of sums borrowed when the SSIA started; and did not assign or otherwise pledge SSIA assets as security for a loan.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are currently consulting with financial institutions to ensure that the above maturity arrangements are implemented in an efficient and practical manner during 2006 and 2007. They have also advised that all financial institutions will, at the appropriate time, supply the SSIA4 declaration to each of their SSIA holders for completion and return to them within the relevant timeframe and, consequently, account holders will not have to initiate contact with their savings manager in this regard.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no general 11 week delay in dealing with claims for tax relief for medical expenses, or any other form of tax relief.</P>
        <P>At the start of each tax year, the Revenue Commissioners issue in excess of 2 million certificates of tax credits to customers. In addition, most requests for PAYE balancing statements and claims to repayment tend to be concentrated in the first quarter of the year. This generates a considerable increase in the level of customer <Col N="2079"/>contacts and demand for services can be exceptionally high from January to March. This can result in some delays in dealing with claims made during the period.</P>
        <P>Claims for tax relief are processed in customer service areas in customers&rsquo; tax districts. There is no embargo on staffing in these areas. However, as mentioned, the extra level of demand for services at this time of year places extra burdens on available resources.</P>
        <P>Interest on repayments is payable from six months after a claim becomes a valid claim until the repayment is made. This includes cases where there has been an administrative delay on the part of Revenue in processing a valid claim.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband facilities is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector telecommunications companies operating in a fully liberalised market. A number of factors determine where and when broadband services are offered in any area, including the potential number of customers, the level of investment required and so on. My Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, lists all service providers that offer broadband service in County Meath and gives contact details on process for the various service levels on offer.</P>
        <P>Eircom has digital subscriber lines, DSL, available from the telephone exchanges in Navan, Kells, Athboy, Duleek, Trim, Bettystown, Ratoath, Dunshaughlin, Dunboyne and Ashbourne. The company recently announced plans to extend coverage to Ballivor, Tara and Oldcastle by March 2006. My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is building high-speed open access broadband networks, in co-operation with the local and regional authorities, in almost 120 cities and towns. These networks will be used by the private sector companies to offer true broadband services at competitive prices.</P>
        <P>The MANs for Navan and Trim have been approved and they will proceed to detailed design and procurement in the coming months. Proposals have been received for a number of towns in the second phase of the MANs programme, including Athboy, Duleek, Dunboyne, Kells and Laytown-Bettystown, and also for the south Meath broadband corridor linking Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin, Dunboyne-Clonee and Ratoath. <Col N="2080"/>The MANs are being built in association with the local and regional authorities and will remain in State ownership, an important consideration for the future.</P>
        <P>My Department also administers the county and group broadband scheme for smaller towns and rural communities, under which grant aid of up to 55% of set-up costs is available. The programme is driven by the broadband needs of the community and addresses those needs by funding the most appropriate broadband technology for each application. Approval has been granted for a group broadband scheme in Ballivor. We will also roll out broadband to all schools in the county by the end of 2005.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband facilities is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector telecommunications companies operating in a fully liberalised market. A number of factors determine where and when broadband services are offered in any area, including the potential number of customers, the level of investment required, and so on. Eircom recently announced plans to extend broadband coverage to Baltinglass by March 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is building high-speed open access broadband networks, in co-operation with the local and regional authorities, in more than 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above. My Department administers the county and group broadband scheme for smaller towns and rural communities such as Baltinglass, under which grant aid of up to 55% of set-up costs is available. The programme is driven by the broadband needs of the community and addresses those needs by funding the most appropriate broadband technology for each application. The second call for proposals is open until 28 April and full details of the scheme are on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.gbs.gov.ie</i>. We will also roll out broadband to all schools in the county by the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>There are 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, wireless, cable, fibre and satellite. Technologies are available to deliver broadband to any part of Ireland. My Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, lists eight service providers that offer satellite broadband in the Baltinglass area and gives contact details and prices for the services on offer.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to commercial salmon fishing licences, which, under the Fisheries Acts, are an operational matter for which the regional fisheries boards &mdash; in this case the Southern Regional Fisheries Board &mdash; are responsible. I am advised by the board that there are two main river catchments with commercial fisheries in County Waterford. These are the River Blackwater into Youghal harbour, which is in the Lismore fishery district, and the Rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir into Waterford harbour, which is in the Waterford fishery district.</P>
        <P>According to the board, there is a several private fishery in the tidal waters of the River Blackwater on which 40 private drift net licences operate. Six draft net licences and one trap licence are privately owned in this several fishery. I am advised by the fisheries board, however, that the six draft net licences have been the subject of a set-aside scheme for the past five years &mdash; 2000 to 2004 &mdash; which was funded equally by the fisheries board and angling and tourism interests. This set-aside scheme is being reviewed by the board and negotiations are ongoing with all relevant stakeholders on the feasibility of renewing the scheme in 2005. In addition to this several fishery, the board advises that 41 public drift net licences operate in the Lismore fishery district, south of Youghal New Bridge on the N25 out to sea for six miles west to Ballycotton and east to Helvick Head. The fisheries board confirms that no fishing licences have been bought out in this district.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the board that there are 132 snap net licences and three draft net licences in the Waterford fishery district issued to fishermen operating above a line from Cheekpoint across to the east side of the Barrow Bridge. The board also advises that 173 public drift net licences operate in Waterford harbour, south of the Cheekpoint line and out to sea for six miles east to Bannow Bay and west to Helvick Head. The board confirms there has been no set-aside or buy out of licences in the Waterford fishery district.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently made regulations &mdash; European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005, SI 60 of 2005 &mdash; to give further legal effect to Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003, concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC.</P>
        <P>The directive strengthens, <i>inter alia</i>, the unbundling provisions of distribution system operators by requiring the separation of the network business, natural monopoly, from competitive activities, namely generation and supply, so as to ensure non-discriminatory access to the network and avoid conflicts of interest. The review of the electricity sector, which I recently announced, includes an examination of options for the legal unbundling of the distribution system operator, DSO. Measures for unbundling the DSO are required to be introduced by 1 July 2007 and I am progressing this matter in line with this timeframe.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the independent regulator for gas and electricity, in accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. On 19 February this year the market opened fully to competition. All customers are eligible to source their electricity from a licensed supplier and the entire market becomes contestable. Scope exists for all customers, household and non-household, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market.</P>
        <P>While there are no private wholesalers, there are six active independent suppliers in the retail market, with 33% of total energy being supplied by these independents. Market opening &mdash; the removal of barriers and putting in place the enabling systems and processes &mdash; makes it easy and simple for customers to switch and for suppliers to enter the market.</P>
        <P>The question of using computer hardware and software to enable the liberalised market to function effectively is a matter for the parties directly involved in consultation with the CER. I have no specific information in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to new EU regulations, the European Commission will undertake a further in-depth review of progress in creating the internal electricity market this year. On the basis of this market analysis, the Commission will assess the need for additional measures to improve the functioning of the market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy paper of July 2002 on developing country debt stated Ireland&rsquo;s support for 100% debt cancellation under certain circumstances and on the basis of additional resources from donors. It also concluded that, to mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their official development assistance more rapidly. The Government has promoted its debt policy at the World Bank and the IMF and in discussions with other international aid donors and will continue to do so. Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on developing country debt were conveyed to the president of the World Bank during his visits to Ireland in 2003 and, most recently, in January 2005. The Taoiseach highlighted these concerns and called for debt cancellation when he addressed the bank in March 2003. He and other members of the Government availed of every opportunity to express these concerns while Ireland held the Presidency of the European Union in 2004.</P>
        <P>While it is not the approach favoured in our debt policy, the idea of selling part of the International Monetary Fund gold reserves to fund debt cancellation is interesting and it has gained some support among the G7 countries. The managing director of the IMF, Rodrigo de Rato, has been asked to bring forward for the spring meetings of the IMF proposals on the funding of debt relief, among which is the sale or revaluation of the IMF gold reserves. All such proposals will be considered by the Minister for Finance in consultation with my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 to 104, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The allocation criteria for Community development aid is one of the policy issues to be resolved in the negotiation of the development co-operation and economic co-operation instrument in the context of the ongoing financial perspectives 2007-2013 debate.</P>
        <P>On 26 January 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council held the fourth annual policy debate about the effectiveness of the European Union&rsquo;s external action. The Council adopted conclusions inviting the Commission, in the light of experience and best international practice, to present proposals on extending the use of standard, objective and transparent resource allocation criteria, based on need and performance, to all EC external assistance.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, on 22 October 2004, former Commissioners Nielson and Patten wrote to EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs and development co-operation transmitting ideas for a common approach for future resource allocation, which should apply to all developing and transition countries to be covered by the future development co-operation and economic co-operation instrument. The commissioners indicated that they wished to leave it to the incoming Commission to develop appropriate allocation approaches for the countries to be covered by other relevant instruments. The Commission has yet to make a proposal regarding allocation criteria in the external relations chapter of the financial perspectives. Ireland regards this as a priority and will continue to call for the earliest possible submission of a proposal.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council considered the external relations chapter of the financial perspectives proposal at its meeting on 22 November last and concluded that delegations in general agreed with the proposed scope of the three geographic financing instruments for external relations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs on that occasion underlined the need to have the development components of funds under the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument ring-fenced for official development assistance, ODA, objectives and this remains Ireland&rsquo;s position.</P>
        <P>In the continuing discussions of the development co-operation and economic co-operation instrument at Council working group level, Ireland and a number of other delegations have pressed for poverty reduction, sustainable econ<Col N="2086"/>omic and social development and the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy to be given concrete expression in the instrument&rsquo;s articles. Ireland is also seeking to ensure it should incorporate best development practice, such as partner country ownership, alignment with partner country strategies and harmonisation of donor aid delivery approaches.</P>
        <P>The Commission has proposed dealing with the countries in southern and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean in the pre-accession and European neighbourhood and partnership instruments. These, together with the development co-operation and economic co-operation instrument, constitute the three primary instruments for external relations&rsquo; spending. The Commission proposal for the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument is based on the Union&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening co-operation with its neighbouring countries on the basis of partnership and joint ownership and the building on shared values of democracy and human rights.</P>
        <P>The 2000 Council-Commission development policy statement is to be revised this year. The Commission will shortly submit a formal proposal to the Council setting out its views on what form this should take. Food security has traditionally played a very important role in the anti-poverty strategies of the Community. The Community subscribes to the undertakings entered into at the 1997 World Food Summit and its 2002 follow-up conference.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The importance of tourism as an instrument of national and regional development has long been recognised by this Government and, in that context, achieving as wide as possible a distribution of visitor numbers across the different regions with an associated spread of tourism revenue has long been recognised as a major objective and challenge for tourism policy.</P>
        <P>Various factors have conspired to exacerbate regional growth problems in recent years, most notably the increasing international trend towards shorter, more frequent breaks, which favour the more easily accessible urban destinations. This has driven, to a significant extent, the more robust growth in Dublin and the eastern region. At a time of overall national tourism growth, I remain concerned that the issue of regional spread should be proactively and energetically addressed and in that context I am pleased that the programmes and initiatives operated by the State tourism agencies and the action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group fully reflects this objective.</P>
        <P>While many of the actions proposed by the tourism policy review group will have a positive impact on the regional distribution of tourism numbers and revenue, key actions that I would highlight include those relating to product development, tourism promotion, access transport and the appropriate infrastructure and arrangements for the delivery of tourism policy at regional level.</P>
        <P>A major impediment to growth for certain regions, particularly the western seaboard and the north west, and from certain key source markets, particularly the US, has been the lack of good quality direct access. Recent developments &mdash; in particular the announcements by Ryanair on its plans to develop Shannon Airport as a European hub, American Airlines&rsquo; announcement on new services from Boston and Chicago and Continental Airlines&rsquo; plans for a new direct service to Belfast &mdash; provide a welcome boost to the regions as we move into 2005. These developments build on the significant expansion by Aer Lingus of its route network since 2001. Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which have been active in their pursuit of access improvements, will help to promote these routes in order to optimise their inbound tourism potential.</P>
        <P>In their plans for 2005, both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will roll out a number of very innovative approaches which should heighten the <Col N="2088"/>regional impact of Ireland&rsquo;s marketing activities both nationally and overseas: All regions will feature prominently in the full range of marketing activities; a dedicated marketing fund for tactical co-operative initiatives with the regional tourism authorities and their members will be established for 2005; a region to region approach will be adopted in Britain which will capitalise on direct access links to the regions; specific campaigns promoting the western seaboard will be mounted in North America; a sponsor a region approach will be adopted in Europe whereby each market office will focus attention alternately on a particular Irish region in order to enhance the awareness of the local trade of what that region has to offer; an enhanced consumer website with increased functionality and a strong regional input will provide for more dynamic and up-to-the minute packages to entice the domestic traveller; and a strong focus on event based holidays will be complemented by a more streamlined and targeted festivals and cultural events fund which will continue to favour the lesser developed regions.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, I have no direct responsibility in individual actions or measures relating to tourism promotion or development in so far as specific areas of the country are concerned. These are a day-to-day function of the tourism agencies.</P>

	<P>The essential purpose of trademark legis<Col N="2089"/>lation is to protect trade mark proprietors through giving them exclusive rights to the use of trade marks on their products. Trademark legislation is not designed to specifically address distribution issues of the kind reflected in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>

A considerable body of European case law relating to parallel importing using a registered trade mark and the exhaustion of rights concept exists, which may be relevant in the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question. The concept of international exhaustion of rights, that is where products are placed on the market outside of the EEA, does not exist.</P>
        <P>In the context of the foregoing, the aggrieved party or parties in the case referred to by the Deputy may wish to obtain professional legal advice and opinion of such case law as it might apply in their particular circumstances. If they feel there are any issues of an anti-competitive nature, they should contact the Competition Authority in the matter. The authority is an independent body charged with enforcing the Competition Act 2002, which prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position in the market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s payment delivery policy is to ensure that the most modern range of payment options is available to our customers. This approach is adopted to ensure that customer service is continually improved by providing access to a wide range of payment options and new services and facilities in the money transmission market.</P>
        <P>The current range of payment options offered by my Department includes payment at post offices by means of a pension order book, electronic or manual post draft, issued to the <Col N="2090"/>customers designated post office each week, payment by cheque to the home address of customers, and direct payment to customers&rsquo; bank or building society accounts by electronic fund transfer. Where possible, my Department provides customers with the payment option which best suits them.</P>
        <P>The growth in the last number of years of customers opting for EFT payments reflects the changing profile of my Department&rsquo;s customer base, the increasing use of electronic banking services in society generally, and the extension of an EFT payment facility to more of my Department&rsquo;s schemes. Recent industrial action affecting postal delivery services has had some impact on the number of people opting for EFT as an alternative to cheque payments.</P>
        <P>Some 59% of customers currently receive payment through their local post office, 10% are paid by cheque through the postal system, and 31% receive direct electronic payment through their bank or building society account. It should be noted that An Post does not provide an EFT facility for social welfare customers except in relation to the Post Office Savings Bank which requires a seven day advance notice of withdrawal.</P>
        <P>The issue of bank charges payable by my Department&rsquo;s customers is a matter for each customer having regard to their personal banking arrangements. It is understood, however, that some financial institutions offer special facilities to elderly persons involving free banking or reduced banking charges.</P>

	<P>The free travel companion pass scheme was introduced in 1990 for persons who qualify for free travel and who, because of their disability, are unable to travel alone. Those who are eligible for a companion free travel pass include recipients of disability allowance or invalidity pension who are medically assessed as being unfit to travel unaccompanied; people who are blind or severely visually impaired; people who are confined to wheelchairs; people who are aged 75 years and over and are medically certified as unfit to travel alone; and people who are receiving full-time care and attention from someone who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance. The companion pass enables a person aged 16 or over to accompany the pass holder free of charge. The companion pass scheme ensures that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to free travel is not diminished because a companion cannot afford to accompany them. Any further extension to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The Dublin and mid-Leinster area of the Health Service Executive has advised that the person in question had been accommodated in a direct provision centre provided by the Reception and Integration Agency after she applied for asylum in the State. When she was in the centre she was entitled to a direct provision allowance of &euro;19.10 for herself and &euro;9.60 for her child. The person voluntarily left direct provision accommodation in October 2004. The HSE has advised that she recently contacted a community welfare officer about the payment of supplementary allowance. After the review of her case, it has been decided to award her, from a current rate, a reduced rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance equal to her rate of direct provision allowance. The reduced rate is being paid on the basis that she voluntarily vacated the accommodation provided for her under the direct provision scheme.</P>
        <P>As of 27 May 2003, people who are awaiting decision on applications for refugee status, or are not lawfully in the State, are ineligible for rent supplement or other social welfare assistance towards their accommodation costs. As the person concerned falls into that category she is not entitled to receive rent supplement. However, she and her child continue to have the option of availing of the accommodation provided through the direct provision facilities operated by the Reception and Integration Agency. The Department has no record of an application for unemployment assistance from the person concerned.</P>

The company informs me that it has examined the case for re-opening Dunleer station on a number of occasions. A review of the Dublin suburban rail strategy, conducted on behalf of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, concluded that the station would experience very modest daily boardings <Col N="2093"/>due to the size of the local population. The case for re-opening Dunleer will be re-examined if major development takes place close to the line and funding can be provided by developers for the construction of a station.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 123 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>An NRA analysis of factors contributing to fatal and injury accidents in 2002 indicates that the behaviour of drivers &mdash; 86% &mdash; and pedestrians &mdash; 9.7% &mdash; is the key contributory factor. Road factors were identified as contributing to only 2.5% of fatal and serious injury in accidents. I understand from the NRA that since 1994 it has operated in conjunction with local authorities a programme under which accident locations on the national road network are investigated. If the condition of a road is believed to have been a factor, appropriate engineering measures are put in place to improve the situation. An average of 80 such locations are treated each year.</P>
        <P>Each year the NRA spend significant sums on road safety measures. In 2005, &euro;40.5 million has been allocated to the NRA road safety programme. The money will be spent on a range of road safety measures including accident remedial schemes, traffic calming and safety barriers in central reservations. The NRA has an ongoing pavement restoration programme and a maintenance programme designed to deal with pavement surface and other deficiencies. The major upgrade of the national road network currently under way is also delivering a major road safety dividend. New roads, constructed to best practice standards &mdash; including the highest quality road surfacing &mdash; help to reduce road accidents and fatalities. Motorways and dual carriageways are safer because the possibility of head-on collisions is almost eliminated.</P>
        <P>Substantial levels of funding are also being made available by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to develop and improve non-national roads.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to a similar question put to me in this House yesterday to which I replied as <Col N="2097"/>follows: The scheduling and timetabling of trains is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to consider. On the basis of projected demand into the future, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has submitted a greater Dublin integrated rail network plan, which proposes the enhancement of all suburban and outer suburban services into Dublin. The proposals are currently being examined by my Department in the context of the ten-year investment framework for transport.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I understand from the company that some of the 36 new diesel railcars, due to come into service at the end of this year, will be allocated to the Kildare route to extend all trains to eight-car length. This will improve the capacity on individual trains by up to 33%. This capacity increase comes on top of a capacity increase of almost 160% delivered on that line in the last 18 months. In regard to the Maynooth-Connolly line, I understand that, in the short-term, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plans to place the majority of the 36 diesel railcars on the Sligo-Maynooth-Dublin line to increase capacity and to remove <Col N="2098"/>older rolling stock from service. The effect of this will be to increase all commuter trains on the line to eight-car length, giving an immediate capacity increase on some services of 33%.</P>

	<P>Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The Deputy will be aware that allocations made by the board from the fund must be in accordance with its disbursement plan which was approved by me in September 2003. Under the plan, the bulk of dormant accounts funding is initially being targeted at those areas designated as most disadvantaged, that is, RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas.</P>
        <P>The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer this initial round of funding on its behalf and the process of assessing and approving applications received is currently ongoing. To date the board has approved 454 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;46 million. The details of all the approvals to date, on a county basis, are appended for information. Based on information received from the board, I am satisfied that the board, in making its allocations to date, is adhering to the provisions set out in its disbursement plan.</P>

	<P>While I am aware that significant quantities of fresh milk are being imported into the State, provided such milk meets the standards of EU Directive 92/46, it can be traded freely within the European Union.</P>
        <P>My role, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, is to ensure that an EU policy framework is in place, and EU market management measures are implemented in a manner which allows the dairy sector to continue to develop and to support farmers incomes. In this context, I am very pleased to report that milk producer prices in Ireland during the past 12 months are similar to those of the previous year, notwithstanding the introduction of the dairy premium as part compensation for the expected fall in producer prices.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to request Teagasc <Col N="2101"/>to establish a facility for land leasing or a land exchange to help with the upscale and consolidation of the dairy industry.</P>
        <P>Under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988, the function of Teagasc is to provide research, training and advisory services for the agri-food sector. Moreover, the milk quota regulations restrict the establishment of new leases to very limited situations and I have no plans to alter those provisions.</P>
        <P>However, I am considering other means of assisting with the consolidation of production and I believe the milk quota restructuring programme 2005-06, which I announced before Christmas, taken together with the decoupling of the dairy premium this year, will help bring about significant improvements in the structure of milk production.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The alignment of supply with demand is essentially a market issue. I am aware that there is an over supply situation in the potato sector and this, combined with falling consumption due to changing eating habits, is giving rise to continuing downward pressure on prices.</P>
        <P>The establishment of any voluntary scheme to control production is a matter for growers. In this context I would urge growers to listen to the message from the market place and to make their production decisions accordingly. It is essential that there is strong cohesion and co-operation among all those involved in production in order to ensure that the sector can grow and prosper.</P>
        <P>For my part I am continuing to support the sector through the grant aid scheme for marketing and processing under the national development plan. Under this scheme a total of 17 projects were awarded grant aid amounting in total to &euro;6.3 million in the last few months. In addition a &euro;100,000 potato promotion programme has been submitted for approval to the European Commission and this will play an important role in encouraging increased consumption.</P>

	<P>At present, a minimum of 20 income units from farming is required in the case of applicants for grants under the on-farm investment schemes. This includes the farm waste management scheme which has now replaced the control of farm pollution scheme. The European Commission has repeatedly opposed any relaxation of this minimum income requirement despite several approaches by my Department on the matter. Consultations are currently ongoing with the European Commission in regard to the action programme for implementation of the nitrates directive in Ireland. The question of possible changes to the conditions of the farm waste management scheme will be considered in the light of the outcome of these consultations.</P>

However, it is open to non-EEA nationals who have been legally resident in the State for five years, on the basis of work permit conditions, to apply to the immigration division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from work permit requirements. A non-national who has resided legally in the State for eight years may apply for long-term residency in the State without condition as to time. Periods of residence in the State for the purpose of study or for the examination of an asylum claim will not count for this purpose.</P>
        <P>It is also open to the person in question to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation if he or she has a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.</P>
        <P>Permission to remain in the State is given on my behalf in the form of a stamp, endorsement, placed in the non-EEA national&rsquo;s passport. This is a statement of the conditions on which the non-EEA national is permitted to remain in the State and the duration of that permission.</P>

However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that on inspection of the vehicle in question it was noted that no insurance disc was displayed and an expired vehicle licence was displayed. A male nearby initially denied any knowledge of the vehicle. This same person subsequently claimed ownership of the vehicle when a tow wagon arrived to tow the vehicle to Clondalkin Garda station. At no time at the scene did the named female present herself or documents to garda&iacute;. The vehicle was subsequently collected by a garage employee in the company of the named female at Santry Garda station. The vehicle was driven under the trade plate of the garage concerned. The named female subject also failed to keep an appointment for 16 March 2005 <Col N="2104"/>with the local superintendent at Clondalkin Garda station, in order to discuss the matter.</P>

        <P>I am not prepared to provide the exact reasons for each release as to do so would be releasing personal medical information on non-prisoners into the public domain. However, I can confirm that each of these releases was granted for valid compassionate reasons consistent with those applied to other Provisional IRA prisoners since the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

	<P>The premises in question is a six bed transitional accommodation project for women leaving prison. The project is designed to work primarily with women who would otherwise be homeless at the end of their sentence or while on temporary release. Accommodation is also provided, in limited circumstances, for women <Col N="2105"/>offenders in the community, under the supervision of the probation and welfare service.</P>
        <P>The project is a limited company owned by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and managed by the De Paul Trust. The De Paul Trust is an established and experienced organisation providing and managing accommodation services for the homeless among other services in Ireland and in the UK. The project is funded by my Department, through the probation and welfare service and has been operational since February 2003.</P>
        <P>Since opening, it has provided accommodation and additional services for 30 women who would otherwise have been homeless. The staff of the project have engaged with nearly 70 women in the D&oacute;chas centre, Mountjoy female prison. All residents sign a licence agreement at the start of their time at the project and have a key worker assigned for individualised support and advice. They participate in a group work programme which addresses personal development, skills training and self management. The aim is to assist residents to develop skills for independent living so that they can settle in the community. Staff at the project liaise with Trinity Court drug treatment centre and relevant psychiatric and medical services where appropriate.</P>
        <P>During 2004, the first full year in operation, four residents were assisted in resettlement in supported accommodation. One resident achieved a permanent job in a local community project. Two residents were awarded education trust grants for short training courses and eight residents have taken up full time programmes with an educational or pre-employment focus. Almost all women leaving were supported in their move on from the programme.</P>

This applies regardless of whether the person in question has applied for a certificate of naturalisation.</P>

	<P>The major reduction in the number of asylum applicants is now giving me an opportunity to refocus resources on areas of service provision for non-nationals which are under resourced at present.</P>
        <P>Given the large number of staff involved and having regard to the reduction in the number of asylum applications being received in the State, I have engaged the services of PA Consulting Group in order, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure that the staffing resources currently available within the asylum, immigration and citizenship areas of my Department are optimised and targeted in the most effective manner possible at core functional activities &mdash; one of which, in the immigration and citizenship areas, is an improvement in customer service. Some redeployment of staff from the asylum to the immigration and citizenship areas has already taken place.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of rapid and unprecedented growth in the immigration area, it is not simply a matter of staffing. Information technology will play an important part in the implementation of a long-term sustainable solution. In this regard, preparatory work is being undertaken on a request for tender document which will lead in due course to a major enhancement of the information technology capacity of the immigration and citizenship areas of my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition, the recently announced new Irish naturalisation and immigration service, INIS, by providing a one-stop-shop approach will improve customer services for legally resident migrants. It will do so specifically by providing: a single contact point or one-stop-shop for applications for entry to the State, combining the current work permit and visa application processes; a clearer system involving more streamlined processes; and improved sharing of information in linked systems should simplify decision making; improved service times as applications do not have to be submitted to a number of organisations; improved control and enforcement mechanisms.</P>
        <P>The benefits of the new service should become clear from an early date. Within a year there should be a significantly improved service with a much clearer customer focus, revised organisational procedures and IT systems in place to deliver improved customer service and to strengthen enforcement mechanisms.</P>

        <P>To those answers I wish to add that the subject matter of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is not new, although it may be more prominent in public debate given the huge increase in our non-national population. Deputies from all sides of the House have raised concerns about service from the immigration and citizenship division of the Department since the early 1990s, if not earlier. Whatever actions were taken in respect of those concerns clearly did not stand the test of time. Nobody contemplated then that Ireland&rsquo;s asylum seeking population would mushroom to the extent that it did and nobody anticipated the extent to which the Irish born child phenomenon would grow.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the level of customer service in immigration and citizenship matters is less than it should be. What I am interested in achieving is a long-term sustainable solution. To that end I have engaged the services of PA Consulting Group in order,<i> inter alia</i>, to ensure that the staffing resources currently available within the asylum, immigration and citizenship areas of my Department are optimised and targeted in the most effective manner possible at core functional activities, including citizenship.

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 13 February 2002. The <Col N="2109"/>application would have been briefly examined at that time to ensure the applicant had been resident in the State for the statutory five-year period.</P>
        <P>I considered the application on 31 March 2004 and decided not to grant a certificate of naturalisation. The applicant had arrived in the State in 1996 and applied for asylum. The application was refused in August 1998 and that decision was upheld on appeal in December 1999. In that same month, he obtained permission to remain in the State on foot of being the parent of an Irish born child.</P>
        <P>I have decided as a matter of general policy not to reckon, for naturalisation purposes, residency in the State for the sole purpose of seeking asylum in circumstances where the application was not successful. When this general policy was applied to the applicant&rsquo;s case, I considered that he did not have sufficient reckonable residency in the State to merit naturalisation. In arriving at my decision, I considered that there were no exceptional circumstances disclosed in the applicant&rsquo;s case why I should not apply the stated general policy.</P>
        <P>This decision was conveyed in writing to the person concerned on 28 May 2004, together with the reasons for same. I emphasise that the application of the person concerned was fully processed and was unsuccessful; it was not invalid.</P>
        <P>A new application from the person referred to was received in my Department on 22 February 2005. Applications for certificates of naturalisation are generally dealt with in chronological order and this practice is not deviated from except in exceptional circumstances. I do not consider that the reasons put forward in the new application are sufficient in this regard. I will inform both the Deputy and the applicant as soon as I have reached a decision on the new application.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a situation where the child, although born in Ireland on or after 1 January 2005, is not entitled by operation of law to Irish citizenship, as a result of changes to our citizenship laws which came into effect on that date. Subject to certain exceptions, those changes mean that such a child is not entitled to citizenship by operation of law where neither non-national parent has, during the period of four years immediately preceding the child&rsquo;s birth, been lawfully resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than three years, or periods the aggregate of which is not <Col N="2110"/>less than three years, periods of lawful residence as a student or as an asylum applicant being discounted in that context.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, empowers a parent to apply for a certificate of naturalisation on behalf of such a child. A condition precedent under that section is that the parent in question has had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of lawful residence for the purposes of study and periods of lawful residence as an asylum applicant are not reckonable for that purpose.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy 2004-2006 proposes that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will enter into arrangements for the engagement of a private sector concern for the purposes of the provision and operation of a nationwide programme for the detection of speeding offences. Outsourcing of the operation of camera equipment would free up Garda resources for enforcement purposes, thus allowing garda&iacute; to concentrate on detections requiring direct interception, such as driving while intoxicated. New legislative provisions would be introduced to support the initiative.</P>
        <P>The strategy makes clear that the overall performance criteria to be applied to the outsourced detection of speeding offences would be determined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and camera detection facilities would be used at locations where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na determine there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. The purpose of the initiative would be to increase road safety and thereby reduce death and injuries, not increase revenue.</P>
        <P>A working group on speed cameras chaired by my Department, and consisting of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority, is currently examining how the provision, operation and processing of the output of speed cameras might operate.

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 introduced provisions governing the type of residency which was reckonable for the purposes of making an application for naturalisation. These provisions came into effect on 30 November 2002. At the same time, the number of applications for naturalisation being received was increasing dramatically.</P>
        <P>At that time, the process involved in examining applications at the time of receipt was considered to be too time consuming and would have involved, in many instances, checking the applicant&rsquo;s immigration status with the Garda national immigration bureau. Consequently, it was decided that applications would be examined and processed in chronological order so as to be fair to all applicants, not only those who did not meet the statutory residency criteria.</P>
        <P>Additional resources have now been deployed in the citizenship section of my Department. These additional resources, coupled with an ongoing review of procedures, have enabled my officials, with effect from the beginning of April next, to examine all applications at the time of receipt to ensure compliance with the residency requirements. Applications from persons who do not have the necessary residency will be returned straight away and they will be informed of the shortfall in the residency to enable them to take steps to meet the requirements in the future.</P>

        <P>Following the Supreme Court judgment in the L&amp;O case, which confirmed that subject to certain criteria, the State was entitled to deport the non-national parents of an Irish born child, the person was informed by letter dated 18 July 2003 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. In accordance with the Immigration Act 1999, she was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before a deportation order was signed or consenting to the making of a deportation order.</P>
        <P>Her case file, including all representations submitted, was considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, prohibition of refoulement. A deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 10 May 2004.</P>
        <P>On the date that the deportation order was signed, my Department was notified by the East Coast Area Health Board that the person concerned had been re-united in Ireland with her three Cameroonian children. Notices of deportation orders then issued in respect of her three Cameroonian children in accordance with the procedures indicated above. In the normal course of events, this person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations and additional information received, <Col N="2113"/>would fall to be re-considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, prohibition of refoulement. However, as the parent of an Irish-born child, she may, if she so wishes, apply to have her application considered under the revised arrangements introduced by me for the consideration of applications for permission to remain made by the non-national parents of Irish-born children born before 1 January 2005. An information notice setting out details of the new arrangements and the appropriate application form is available from the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.justice.ie</i>. Application forms are also available from Garda district headquarters stations outside Dublin and at all Reception and Integration Agency accommodation centres countrywide. Forms have also been supplied to various non-governmental organisations working with immigrants and asylum seekers. The person concerned should note that the deadline for the receipt of applications is 31 March 2005. This scheme does not make any provision for persons granted permission to remain to be joined by family members from outside the State.</P>

        <P>I should mention that under the terms of the schemes, students are not eligible to receive funding in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level and that students who already hold a qualification at undergraduate degree level are not generally eligible for funding in respect of further study at this level. Also, tax-relief on tuition fees is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states.

        <P>The phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for physical education, non-examination, commenced in September 2003. The syllabuses both at primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities undertaken so that each individual school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to the school. No timescale for implementation has been decided upon for introduction of physical education as an examination subject.</P>

	<P>In April 2000, the management committee of the national educational psychological service, NEPS, prepared a development plan, which recommended that each newly appointed cohort of psychologists should be divided among the regions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, related to the projected student numbers in each region.</P><Col N="2118"/>
        <P>On this basis, it was envisaged that ultimately five psychologists would be needed in County Waterford in order to provide a service to all primary and post-primary schools. The current situation is that there are three psychologists based in the Waterford office and their work is overseen by the regional director for the south eastern region &mdash; also a psychologist.</P>
        <P>I am aware that, at present, County Waterford does not have its full complement of psychologists in place. The most recent panel of psychologists established by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners has now been exhausted and arrangements for the recently established Public Appointments Service to set up a new panel are at a preliminary stage. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers. Therefore, I cannot at present give a firm date for when the NEPS service in County Waterford will be up to full strength.</P>
        <P>When the next recruitment competition for NEPS psychologists takes place, regional panels, rather than one national panel, will be established. This will allow my Department to give priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need.</P>
        <P>Pending the expansion of NEPS to cover all schools, those that are not yet served may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA. The SCPA is an interim measure and was specifically introduced to minimise delays for those children who need to be assessed.</P>

	<P>The person in question retired from teaching on 31 July 1996 and was awarded a pension and lump sum under the secondary teachers&rsquo; superannuation scheme. His benefits were calculated on his reckonable pensionable service of 28 years and 136 days and on his retiring pensionable pay consisting of the maximum point of the common basic salary scale for teachers together with allowances in respect of his principal&rsquo;s post and his academic qualifications.</P>
        <P>It appears that the retired principal feels that he may not be in receipt in pension of the appropriate category of the principal&rsquo;s allowance. He is aware of new principal&rsquo;s allowances which were introduced under the PCW agreement restructuring pay deals and which, in accordance with public service pensions policy in regard to restructuring increases, were not passed on to principals who retired before 1 September 1996. <Col N="2119"/>The allowances in question are the three new categories of principal&rsquo;s allowance which were introduced above the former maximum category. Since the category of allowance held by the retired principal at retirement was below the former maximum, it was not in any way affected by these new provisions. I can confirm that the retired principal is in receipt in pension of the correct amount of the principal&rsquo;s allowance.</P>

	<P>Details of capital and recurrent funding provided to Carlow Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology for the past ten years are set out in the attached document. In June 1996, the Government approved, in principle, the recommendations of the steering com<Col N="2120"/>mittee on the future development of higher education, as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee&rsquo;s report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation rate in degree programmes.</P>
        <P>The Government accepted these recommendations. The provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses in Waterford Institute of Technology, has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach, WIT was among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in 2004, an expert group from the OECD carried out a major review of our higher education system. In the course of their review, the expert group visited Ireland and consulted extensively with all the major education stakeholders. In its report, published in September 2004, it recommended that the differentiation of mission between the university and the institute of technology sectors be preserved and that for the foreseeable future there should be no further institutional transfers into the university sector.</P><Col N="2119"/>

	<P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy is in respect of a person working as a personal assistant for a student with autism attending Athlone Institute of Technology. Personal assistants are utilised within third level colleges for certain classes of students with disabilities, mainly those with physical or mobility difficulties. The main source of funding for personal assistants is the fund for students with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Colleges of further and higher education can apply on behalf of students who require a personal assistant in order to participate equitably in their education. Contractual arrangements in relation to personal assistants vary between institutions. Most colleges either use agencies that supply personal assistants, or employ personal assistants directly on temporary part-time or wholetime contracts. In both cases, the employer of the personal assistant is required to comply with the relevant employment legislation which is in force at this time. In some smaller colleges, personal assistants are contracted on a self-employed basis directly by the student, who is provided with the necessary resources by their college.</P>
        <P>The manner in which the personal assistants are employed is a matter for each institution. The terms and conditions of employment for employees who provide support for students with disabilities in third level is a matter for the individual college, which in this case is Athlone Institute of Technology. Apart from the funds provided specifically for the student support schemes, there is no other funding available from the Department that can be made available in this case.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of proposals for the co-operation of certain third level institutions to establish a facility in Cherry Orchard. However, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern on the need to promote widest possible participation in the third level sector, and a number of measures have been put in place to address this, including the following: first, the establishment of the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education in 2004. This is intended to build upon work which has been conducted to date and to facilitate increasingly inclusive and equitable access to higher education from among members of under-represented groups in higher education. In this regard, the national office has produced a <Col N="2122"/>national action plan which was developed in consultation with stakeholders. Among the important issues addressed in the plan is the development of the most effective means nationally of encouraging and supporting co-operation and action at all levels of the education system towards increasing access and participation in higher education by learners from disadvantaged schools and communities. The national office, in identifying the future road map with quantitative and qualitative targets linked to the allocation of financial resources, has been asked to give particular attention to the setting of national and institutional targets for participation in higher education by the socio-economically disadvantaged, those from the Traveller community, students with disabilities and mature students.</P>
        <P>Second, in addition to the student support maintenance grant schemes under which over 56,000 students benefit, the Department of Education and Science has responsibility for dedicated measures, particularly through the third-level access fund, to promote access and participation opportunities for students including disadvantaged and mature students and students with disabilities, in higher and further education.</P>
        <P>Third, under the social inclusion measures in the NDP, priority is to be accorded in the third level access fund to tackling under-representation by three target groups: students from disadvantaged backgrounds, students with disabilities and mature students. The third level access fund comprises the following funds/measures: special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students &mdash; top-up grants &mdash; the ESF-aided student assistance fund, the ESF-aided fund for students with disabilities, the ESF-aided millennium partnership fund for disadvantage and the national office for equity of access to third level education. Since 1997, spending on these third level access measures funded directly by the Department of Education and Science increased from &euro;0.50 million to a provision of almost &euro;33 million in 2004. This represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners. The <Col N="2123"/>system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is one principal and seven mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 183 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has two resource teachers and the services of a learning support teacher.</P>
        <P>My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school was 183 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</P>

In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and 21 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 591 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has two learning support teachers, two special class teachers, two full-time resource teachers, one shared resource teacher and one temporary language support teacher.</P>
        <P>My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school was 588 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule. Significant improvements have been made to the pupil teacher ratio at primary level, which has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</P>

        <Quest>the number of children in County Monaghan who are being assessed and receiving counselling under the National Education Psychological Service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The work of the educational psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service includes casework with individual children. This may include individual psychometric assessment, provision of advice and recommendations to teachers and parents on how best to meet the child&rsquo;s needs and, occasionally, some short-term counselling support. Counselling would be used for less serious emotional and or behavioural difficulties. Where there are serious difficulties, a referral to the clinical services of the <Col N="2125"/>Health Service Executive is initiated, with the consent of the child&rsquo;s parents for further diagnostic work and intervention.</P>
        <P>At present, five NEPS psychologists, approximately equivalent to two whole-time psychologists, provide a service to 57 out of 77 schools in County Monaghan. The number of assessments undertaken in schools in the county during this school year is 44 to date and a further 38 are planned. This does not include assessments undertaken in six of the schools, for which information is not immediately available as the psychologist assigned to those schools is on annual leave.</P>
        <P>According to the psychologists working in Monaghan, no children are receiving counselling from NEPS psychologists in this school year. A total of 14 have been referred to the clinical services of the HSE in Cavan-Monaghan. Four of these were referred following critical incidents in schools which necessitated involvement by the NEPS psychologist.</P>
        <P>NEPS adds value to its psychological services through its support and development work with schools. This involves enhancing the skills of teachers in, for example, group and individual testing, behavioural management and programme development. In particular, NEPS psychologists in the north-eastern region meet clusters of guidance counsellors and other specialist teachers on a regular basis. In this way the counselling and educational needs of many children can be met without the necessity for individual psychological assessment or other interventions. The psychologists are available as consultants to teachers and parents, thus indirectly helping children.</P>

Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally it has been decided at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional <Col N="2126"/>posts have been used to reduce class sizes, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break &mdash; Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</P>

	<P>Provision of individual psychological assessments is part of the work of the educational <Col N="2127"/>psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service. The psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment. School authorities refer children for assessment and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist&rsquo;s visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days.</P>
        <P>Four psychologists, approximately equivalent to two whole-time psychologists, provide a service to 52 of 90 schools in County Cavan. In Cavan 51 assessments have been undertaken to date in the school year and a further 27 are planned. The average time between an assessment being agreed between a school and a psychologist and completion of the assessment is five weeks. In order to respond to non-urgent needs and to add value to the psychological service, NEPS is enhancing the skills of teachers in the areas of group and individual testing, programme development and behavioural management. In this way many children&rsquo;s needs can be speedily met without the necessity for individual psychological assessment, although the psychologists are available as consultants to teachers and parents, thus helping the children in an indirect way. This helps to reduce waiting times for individual assessment.</P>
        <P>NEPS is being developed on a phased basis over several years and has not yet reached its full staffing complement. Regarding schools in County Cavan that do not yet have access to it, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners.

        <P>At present, five NEPS psychologists, approximately two whole-time equivalent, provide a service to 57 schools out of 77 schools in County Monaghan. In Monaghan schools the number of assessments undertaken to date this year is 44 and a further 38 are planned. This does not include assessments undertaken in six of the schools, for which information is not immediately available as the psychologist assigned to those schools is on annual leave.</P>
        <P>Information to hand indicates that in County Monaghan, the average time between an assessment being agreed between a school and a psychologist and the assessment being completed is five weeks. In order to respond to non-urgent needs and to add value to the psychological service, NEPS is pursuing a policy of enhancing the skills of teachers in the areas of group and individual testing, programme development and behavioural management.

	<P>The work of the educational psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, includes casework with individual children. This may involve individual psychometric assessment, provision of advice and recommendations to teachers and parents on meeting the child&rsquo;s needs and occasionally some short term counselling support. Counselling would be in the context of less serious emotional and/or behavioural difficulties. Where serious difficulties are being experienced, a referral to the clinical services of the Health Service Executive, HSE, is initiated, with the consent of the child&rsquo;s parents, for further diagnostic work and intervention which may include counselling.</P>
        <P>At present, four NEPS psychologists, approximately two whole time equivalent, provide a <Col N="2129"/>service to 52 schools out of a total of 90 schools in County Cavan. The number of assessments undertaken to date in the current school year is 51 and a further 27 are planned. The psychologists working in Cavan have indicated that no children are in receipt of counselling from NEPS psychologists in the current school year. A total of 14 children have been referred to the clinical services of the HSE in Cavan-Monaghan for various reasons. Four of these referrals were made following critical incidents in schools which necessitated involvement by NEPS psychologists.</P>
        <P>NEPS adds value to the psychological services it provides through its support and development work with schools. This involves enhancing the skills of teachers in, for example, the areas of group and individual testing, behavioural management and programme development. In particular, NEPS psychologists in the north eastern region meet clusters of guidance counsellors and other specialist teachers on a regular basis. This means that the counselling and educational needs of many children can be met in an indirect way without the necessity for individual psychological assessment or other interventions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2004-05 school year is a principal plus 23 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 647 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition the school has two learning support posts, four resource teaching posts and one temporary language support post.</P>
        <P>My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school was 623 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.

	<P>The D&aacute;il Select Committee on Education and Science concluded Committee Stage of the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill on 16 December 2004. In February 2005 I received correspondence from the Dublin Inner City Partnership regarding its wish to be represented on the agency.</P><Col N="2131"/>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish an agency whose function, in the first instance, is to prepare a strategic planning scheme for the Grangegorman site. The plan must provide for the needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Health Service Executive, and the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children. The Bill provides for wide ranging consultation with all the parties that may have an involvement in the site. This ranges from those who are directly concerned &mdash; local residents, DIT, Health Service Executive and Dublin City Council &mdash; to other parties whose future involvement may have a bearing on the site reaching its full potential such as the IDA and Dublin Bus. The Department of Transport will also have a major input because of the public transport requirements of the developed site.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have provided for an increase in the size of the agency from 11 to 15 members. I have increased the membership of DIT from one to two and provided for the appointment of an elected representative to the agency. One of the key elements of the Bill is the provision of consultation with, among others, the local community in the neighbourhood of Grangegorman. In order to strengthen this commitment I have made provision for the appointment of a local resident to the agency. I am currently examining the best method of selecting this appointee and will bring forward proposals on Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that adequate provision has been made for consultation with all relevant interested parties. To make provision for one such party above the interests of all others would be counter productive in the context of the development of the site.</P>

	<P>The shared ownership scheme offers home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full ownership in the traditional way. Initially, ownership is shared between the purchaser who buys at least 40% of the value of the house and the local authority from whom the purchaser rents the remaining share.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>In July of this year I increased the maximum loan that can be advanced for a local authority house purchase from &euro;130,000 to &euro;165,000 and extended the period for which local authorities <Col N="2136"/>may advance loans from 25 years to 30 years. At the time of the review I also announced increases in the income limits. The eligibility limits for applying for the shared ownership scheme is now &euro;36,800 for a single income household and &euro;92,000 for a two-income household, using the formula of two and a half times the main income and once the second income.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each local authority to administer house purchase loans in its area, having regard, as appropriate, to the housing needs and circumstances of the area. In determining the maximum mortgage loan in each case, local authorities should have regard to the purchasers&rsquo; ability to repay by reference to their net household income.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor the various housing schemes taking into account the movement in house prices, the effectiveness of various schemes in meeting the needs of the relevant target group and the availability of mortgage finance in the private sector. </P>
