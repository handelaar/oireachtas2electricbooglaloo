    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday in this House, Opposition Deputies exercised their rights to ask questions about the death of a man in Monaghan General Hospital last Friday. In doing so, Deputies reflected the outrage of people all over the country at the fact that a man could die in hospital from a condition which was treatable by the medical staff around him. Far from receiving satisfactory answers, we got a drip-feed of incomplete information. It is incredible that four days after this tragic death, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach did not know that beds were available in Drogheda hospital. It is perfectly obvious that the health services and the competence of the health authorities in the north east are now in a complete mess. The Government has been warned repeatedly about this, but no action was taken politically to accept responsibility and see that competence was delivered. Deputy Crawford produced a letter in this House on 4 October which was sent out to GPs in the Cavan area. It stated that no patient should be sent into the hospital for emergency treatment because of trolleys and an inability to deal with them. It is incomprehensible that a man could have been allowed to die when personnel and medical staff <Col N="2"/>were available with the necessary skills to carry out a vital life saving operation on him.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the protocols laid down for Drogheda, Monaghan and Cavan hospitals impose limitations on what can be done and the procedures that can be carried out? Does he accept that these protocols cause great confusion about what actually can be done? Does he accept that what is needed here is political direction to bring clarity to the situation? Yesterday, I raised the fact that under section 10 of the 2004 Act, the Minister for Health and Children is entitled to give a directive to the Health Service Executive in circumstances like this to the effect that no administrative procedure should prevent skilled surgeons and competent medical people from carrying out a life-saving operation. Will the Taoiseach see to it that such a directive is given under the law by the Minister for Health and Children to bring clarity and certainty to a situation like this? Skilled people in Monaghan General Hospital had to stand around and watch a patient die because of an administrative blockage. That is a scandal, which rests politically with the Taoiseach and the Government. Under the Act, he is entitled to bring clarity to the situation and I ask him to confirm that this morning.</P>

	<P>We had a long debate about this yesterday, but I wish to express again our sincere sympathy to the family of Patrick Walsh, who died tragically in Monaghan last week. Deputy Kenny is right in that all the facts are not known. That is precisely why the T&aacute;naiste announced yesterday &mdash; I reiterated it later &mdash; that Mr. Patrick Declan Carey, consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast will carry out an independent and external review of the circumstance surrounding Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death. That review will be completed, a report will be issued and will be made public. I look forward to the review finding an answer to the question as to the beds available in the region and what the circumstances were in Monaghan General Hospital. Deputy Kenny has come to his conclusion about the circumstances, but I would rather wait to see what happens.</P>
      <P>There was an examination of this matter last year. A report was prepared by a steering group established by the former health board in the area. That steering group was representative of all the key stakeholders, including consultant representation in surgery, medicine and radiology from the hospitals. The recommendations of that steering group were unanimously approved by the members of the group. It recommended that major and emergency surgery should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective, elective surgery. The recommendations refer to advice from the Royal College of Surgeons.</P>
      <P>There are protocols in place, but no protocols prevent doctors doing what is right for patients. They never did and never will.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Who was in the hospital at the time, who was watching and monitoring will all come out in the report. I will not comment on that. Professor Drumm has already stated that the issues around the hospital have been the subject of some considerable debate and that the HSE is working to solve them.</P>
      <P>My view is that to give political directives on these issues is wrong. It is not for us to direct. If there are issues of resources or policy required, the T&aacute;naiste and the Department will do whatever they can in that regard. She and her officials are dealing with all these issues. If I came in here every morning announcing or defending political directives for individual hospitals, or interfering with protocols governing the running of hospitals, that would be entirely wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very sad when anyone dies, but it is wrong to intervene politically. It is right that we provide resources and staff, and we have a policy unit in the Department that works with the HSE. However, although Deputy Kenny might believe that the solution to every problem is to give political directions, I will not go down that road.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Connolly to resume his seat. There are other ways in which Deputy Connolly can raise this issue. He spoke on the Adjournment last night. Deputy Kenny without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Taoiseach is not prepared to give political direction, that is a clear indication he is on his way out of office. The Taoiseach should note that I did not arrive at any conclusion about Monaghan hospital. I did not ask him to issue an individual direction in respect of any hospital. We are talking about the competence of the health service and the health authority and about 200,000 patients in that region.</P>
      <P>Persons of skill and medical experience were unable to operate on Mr. Walsh, who bled to death in Monaghan hospital. They could not operate because of an administrative blockage which can be cleared for this hospital and for every hospital under section 10 of the Health Act. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is entitled to so do if she wishes.</P>
      <P>As this matter is so confused, perhaps the Taoiseach will explain why a surgeon in Monaghan this year, the same person who could have carried out the operation on Mr. Pat Joe Walsh, was criticised by hospital management and the Health Service Executive for carrying out such an operation. If the T&aacute;naiste wishes to give the Taoiseach a briefing, I will wait until she is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OllieWilkinsonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilkinson</NameTxt>
	<P>She will give Deputy Kenny directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not yet concluded because the T&aacute;naiste is giving directions to the Taoiseach. <Col N="5"/>Does the Taoiseach agree, as he did last year, that there should be independence and objectivity when assessing cases like this? If a train crashes or if a building collapses, a special investigative team is used. The Health and Safety Authority has such competence. There is no patient authority service and no health ombudsman who can act with complete objectivity and independence. While I do not decry Mr. Carey&rsquo;s qualifications, this should apply as a matter of competence and as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach see to it that a general directive is given under the Act so that this situation does not recur in any hospital for any patient, in other words, if someone is dying who can be saved, everything that needs to be done in a hospital to save that person will be done whatever the circumstances? Second, will the Taoiseach remove the confusion that exists because of protocols and other matters and put in place a health ombudsman and a patient service authority that will see to it that these situations can be investigated quickly, professionally, independently and objectively&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is long over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so that competence can be achieved in the delivery of the health service? The Government lays down policy while Professor Drumm and the Health Service Executive are merely those who must deliver it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the two points raised, while I do not take issue with Deputy Kenny, we should wait to find out what happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Wait until it happens again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not the first time this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in Monaghan that night. The Deputy has made an assumption and I do not blame him for so doing. He has assumed as he stated in his earlier contribution, that the consultants were present watching the man die. We should wait to find out what were the circumstances. We should wait to find out if protocols or a policy direction from either the HSE or the Department had an effect in this instance. We should wait. While I have learned of some of the circumstances, I am not prepared to state what I have heard until I see a report by an eminent person. I do not believe there will be any argument about that. I noted Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s comments about Dr. Carey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>What will happen then?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second point has some validity and I have answered on this issue previously. As far as the hospitals of Monaghan, Cavan, Drogheda and Dundalk are concerned, for many years we have heard different people on the health boards as well as Members from all sides of this House talk about the issues, debates and occasionally arguments pertaining to that region. People have argued for their own hospital and area and about how the issue should best be handled. As far as policy is concerned and as to how Professor Drumm, his colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and I want to get services right in that region, I am sure the Deputy has heard what Professor Drumm and others have said about this issue in the past. We have also heard what the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has to say.</P>
      <P>Some people have asked why the Royal College of Surgeons should have a role in dictating such issues. From a policy base, someone must make professional assessments as to what is the best way to give treatment to patients in an area, to have the units properly staffed with surgical and medical consultants, with backup ICU beds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Taoiseach think?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;given the population base and what specialties can deal with. These arguments have been fairly well thrashed out. As late as last year, a steering group unanimously approved the present basis.</P>
      <P>Finally, there are no protocols or directions from the HSE, the T&aacute;naiste, myself or the Department to prevent a doctor acting in the best interest of a patient&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The consultant was challenged the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in a certain set of circumstances. If the doctors were present and were challenged, I am confident they will explain that and the full facts will become available. I wish to end as I began, by stating that the tragedy is that Mr. Patrick Walsh is deceased, which I deeply regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Three years ago, a 14 year old boy, Brian Rossiter, was arrested along with two other boys for public order offences in Clonmel. He was brought to Clonmel Garda station where he was put in a cell on his own. The following morning, he was found unconscious in his cell and taken to hospital, first in Clonmel and then to Cork. Three days later he died, never having regained consciousness.</P><Col N="7"/>
      <P>One of the children arrested with Brian Rossiter has made a formal complaint that he was assaulted by a garda while he was in the cells. He states that Brian had stated that he too had been assaulted. The garda&iacute; have at all times claimed that Brian was intoxicated by a mixture of drink and drugs and this information found its way into the autopsy report. We now know that the State Pathologist relied solely upon this information which came from Garda sources and had no toxicology test results when she wrote her report. Subsequent toxicology tests show no evidence of either drink or drugs in Brian&rsquo;s body.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has apologised for the manner in which his Department dealt with pleas from the Rossiter family. However, what baffles everyone concerned is why the Commissions of Investigation Act, which was put through by the Minister only 18 months ago, has not been used to inquire into this situation. Instead, he has used obsolete and little known legislation from 1924. The legislation which he has decided to invoke allows him to inquire into &ldquo;the truth of any charge of complaint of neglect or violation of duty preferred against a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;. No one, the Rossiter family included, has preferred a charge against any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Who decided on the seven garda&iacute; being inquired into on this list furnished to Mr. Hartnett, the senior counsel? It was not drawn up in consultation with or by the Rossiter family. Is the Minister making complaints against these seven garda&iacute;? Why are certain garda&iacute; who were involved on the night in question not included on the list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Experts believe that to choose to use this legislation is to choose an inquiry that will prevent questions being asked and answered, rather than establishing the truth or allowing it to be revealed. If we passed legislation a year and a half ago called the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 that provides for a certain type of speedy, more efficient and certainly cheaper inquiry than we have been accustomed to, why is the Minister not using it instead of going back to the Dublin Police Act 1924, which he sought to apply in the case of Dean Lyons but had to change his mind? The impression one gets is that the Minister is either so chuffed with his discovery of this Act of which nobody knew that he wants to use it somewhere or the truth is being deliberately prevented from coming out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is very anxious that the truth comes out. As I understand it, he is very satisfied that the inquiry, as constituted, <Col N="8"/>will allow Mr. Hartnett the powers to summon witnesses and examine them under oath and all aspects of the arrest and detention of Brian Rossiter. He may require that any serving or retired member of the Garda be called to answer questions under oath, which is not a question of prosecutions. He may require persons other than garda&iacute; to give evidence and is empowered to make findings and reach conclusions. It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to publish the report. Whatever about the arguments regarding whether the 1924 Act or the recent inquiries Act should be used, it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to do all of the above.</P>
      <P>An argument that could also be relevant to the other case is that this is in keeping with the principles employed by the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. There have been some complaints that the inquiry will be held in private. Mr. Hartnett has indicated to the Minister he intends to hold his inquiry in private but this is in keeping with the principles employed by the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 also. The object of this general principle is to make the proceedings less adversarial. The Minister has indicated he intends to publish the report of the Rossiter inquiry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has raised this issue a number of times over the years and I accept his bona fides when he says that he wants the case investigated. An investigation into the matter is being undertaken by an eminent senior counsel which allows all of the issues that have been raised to be investigated. This is important. No one can refuse to contribute or be investigated by the inquiry, be they garda&iacute;, former garda&iacute; or other individuals, and the conclusions will be made public. The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to ensure this matter is dealt with fully to the satisfaction of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said the Minister is satisfied that this method of inquiry is adequate. The Minister was similarly satisfied about this method of inquiry in the Dean Lyons case and he needed to change his view. No other body I have discussed this matter with is satisfied and the Taoiseach does not appear to understand that there are only specific questions, which are listed in the correspondence from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which, incidentally, came from Garda headquarters. Only specific questions can be raised against specific garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Why are there only seven garda&iacute;, why these particular seven, why exclude garda&iacute; involved on the night and who was it that made these complaints in the first place? The unfortunate Rossiter family does not even know enough to make a complaint against any garda and has not done so. This Act expressly requires that one must be able to lodge such a complaint or there cannot be an inquiry but the Minister has ploughed ahead when his Commissions of Inves<Col N="9"/>tigation Act 2004 would seem to be tailor-made for this situation.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a 14 year old boy who died as a result of detention in a Garda station. We are talking about a situation where the State pathologist relied on information from the Garda to the effect he was drugged and intoxicated when subsequent toxicology tests showed he had neither drugs nor alcohol in his blood. This is a matter of grave public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Why will the Minister not address the House and answer who selected the seven garda&iacute;, who made complaints against them and why is he going down this road when he needed to back off in the case of Dean Lyons? This legislation has never been used before. It is very odd and I ask that the Taoiseach have it examined before it proceeds any further as it is quite farcical. I regret that the focus of commentary on it so far has been on a different issue, an issue that I incidentally agree with the Minister about. It is a diversion. The real issue is the terms of reference of this inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no argument about the last issue Deputy Rabbitte raised. All I can say to him on the information I have, and I will check the point he made, is that the inquiry, as constituted, will allow Mr. Hartnett to summon any witnesses and examine them under oath on all aspects of the arrest and all aspects of the detention of Brian. He may require any serving or retired member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not just listed members, to answer questions under oath, which I assume includes everyone who would have been available that night, called to the scene, involved in the arrest and in the station. I understand this is what is meant but I will check. He may require persons other than garda&iacute; to give evidence, which will obviously be anyone who has any information on this matter. He is empowered to make findings and reach conclusions. It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to publish the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe knows, we use legislation here every day that goes back years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If all these powers are available, what is restricting Mr. Hartnett in any way from taking up the point? I have heard what Deputy Rabbitte said and will raise the matter with the Minister but, on the information I have been given, it seems that Mr. Hartnett is not restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years, many local authorities, when giving planning permission for new residential communities, are dictating that crucial public services, such as water supply, sewerage systems, road repairs, public lighting and care of public open spaces, are maintained by private management companies rather than the local authorities themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is becoming the standard in the Dublin local authorities, County Kildare and a number of other areas. The upshot is that mainly young working people buying their first homes are saddled with huge management company fees of up to &euro;500 or more in the case of apartments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the thousands of euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which are demanded by the companies for these services on top of their mortgages, child care and transport costs.</P>
      <P>Tyrellstown in Fingal is a new community of 2,000 homes built in the past four years and will have a population of 5,000 or 6,000 soon, which is the size of many medium sized towns around the State. It is twice the size of Dingle town, for example, or perhaps I should say An Daingean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, by the underhanded means by which the local authorities effect this wholesale privatisation of services, the management companies are foisted on the householders and a new local tax is levied. This is a significant inequity because in neighbouring estates built a few years earlier that may include a &ldquo;millionaires row&rdquo;, services from the local authorities are provided through general taxation, as should be the case.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">It is also a scam because the directors of the management companies for up to the first five years are the developers who built the estates, sold the houses and made massive profits from the new young house owners who, before these management companies were foisted on them, would have had developers maintain these basic services for a period of years until the estate was taken in charge by the local authorities. They are now dragging householders to court, demanding money from them and scaring them with intimid<Col N="11"/>ating letters from debt collectors. If these management companies were mooted in the 1960s, the mohair suited developers who financed Fianna F&aacute;il would have thought it a Tacateer heaven but they would not have dared implement it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is a major instance of a new rip-off and inequity. A revolt will begin because these scare tactics make the reality obvious. Is privatising pubic services in this way and putting a new local tax on hard-pressed taxpayers a conscious Government policy? During an adjournment debate Deputy Noel Ahern, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and known to the Taoiseach, told Deputy Catherine Murphy that the general matters administered by management companies were never the responsibility of local authorities. In fact, all these services were the responsibility of local authorities. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to immediately conduct an investigation? Will he also demand that local authorities desist from this practice and abolish the existing management companies that are the source of this inequity?</P>

      <P>This is not a Government policy. Local authorities have the powers to deal with these issues. It is not controlled or directed by central Government.

      <P>Some charges fall within the management companies&rsquo; service charges and that is a different issue. The point made by Deputy Joe Higgins is that some management companies operate effectively and others do not. They impose a large charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Unelected managers of local authorities impose this as a condition and the fundamental inequity is that young people now purchasing a home under great duress and at high cost are saddled with a local tax of between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per year. In the first five years it is payable to the developer to clean up his or her act and finish the estate so they can move on. <Col N="13"/>Kilnamanagh was an unfortunate example for the Taoiseach to use. It was built but not handed over by Brennan and McGowan and others who are well-known to his party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been mentioned elsewhere. Under this system, in the example illustrated by the Taoiseach these particular developers would get fees for 20 years. The inequity is compounded by the fact that management companies&rsquo; contracts are presented to young house buyers at the same time as they sign contracts for their new homes. That is a time of immense stress and the contracts are signed under duress because the people involved need a home.</P>
      <P>I sound a warning to the Taoiseach. At this stage this might affect tens of thousands of homes and residents. It is becoming a serious issue. Deputy Catherine Murphy, Independent Deputies, other Deputies and I will make this a major issue in the near future and in the lead up to the next election. Thousands of young home owners tell us they cannot endure the situation and they cannot afford the current levels. Those levels will become intolerable because when the sewage and water systems will need major refurbishment in ten or 15 years time, the home owners will be saddled with these debts. We want them abolished and that is what I want to hear from the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This involves a number of issues. A good and valid point on the control of management companies and how they are governed was made by Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, and I know that issue is being examined.</P>
      <P>The point made with regard to local authorities allowing developments and zones is not correct because they have power and a direct influence at local level when dealing with these issues. Management companies may have legitimate charges such as refuse charges, which everyone pays and which the Deputy knows will not be abolished. However, where these companies undertake to carry out responsibilities and perform services, and charge young people and others but then do not do the work, a question is raised on introducing regulations to force them to carry out that work.</P>

        <Quest>if he will report on the implementation of the Nally report on the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendations of the Nally report regarding the re-organisation of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office have been largely implemented. Agreement with the unions involved was achieved during 2001. The criminal prosecution functions undertaken by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office were transferred to the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions at the end of 2001.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A common promotion pool within the two offices, between the CSSO and the solicitors&rsquo; division of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for professional solicitor and technical promotion posts formed part of the agreement and this now operates. A negotiating process with local State solicitors is currently under way seeking to agree on the transfer of the service to the DPP. A review of the current workload of local <Col N="15"/>State solicitors and their expense base is almost completed. Enabling legislation and appropriate legislative provisions are contained in the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, which was signed by the President on 9 July 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year the Taoiseach informed the House that there were 17 vacancies in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office of which nine were professional, five were technical and three were support posts. Does he have the information on what posts were filled or are those positions still unfilled?</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach has information about the amount of work outsourced from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office to private solicitors. Is there cost involved for the taxpayer and if so, how much is it? If work is to be outsourced is this because of lack of expertise arising from manpower difficulties in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The CSSO has recruited mostly additional approved staff. The staffing complement has averaged about 225 over the past year. The office currently has 12 vacancies comprising one professional post, eight technical and three support staff posts.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has recruited additional staff, as sanctioned, and currently has a serving staff complement of approximately 170 full time equivalents. I understand there are only one or two vacancies in the DPP&rsquo;s office, which are in the process of being filled. On the question of outsourcing, there is no reason for not contracting out legal work if the CSSO wants to do this. In the recent past it has contracted out some specific cases where the workload involved was beyond the capacity of the office to handle. It was not that it did not possess the technical expertise, but rather it related to the volume of work. The office has made extensive use of counsel, also, in dealing with its day to day case load.</P>
        <P>As regards the DPP&rsquo;s office, more prosecution work is outsourced to barristers in private practice than in most other common law jurisdictions. The tendency in other common law jurisdictions is to make greater use of in-house lawyers, but the DPP&rsquo;s office still outsources a large amount of work to private practice.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As regards the OECD report, I refer Deputies to previous answers where I have explained that many of its recommendations related to specific sectoral issues. I said the appropriate Ministers with responsibility for those sectoral areas are reporting directly to the House on progressing the OECD recommendations.</P>
        <P>I have also explained that one of the key recommendations of the OECD report was the development of a national policy on better regulation. In January 2004, the Government published the White Paper, Regulating Better. The White Paper sets out six core principles of better regulation and a detailed action plan on how these principles will be translated in terms of how we design, implement and review legislation and regulations. Accordingly, it is the White Paper which contains the thrust of our efforts on regulatory reform, rather than the original OECD report.</P><Col N="18"/>
        <P>Progress has been made in a number of key areas set out in the White Paper, including: the establishment of a better regulation group to oversee the implementation of the commitments and action plan arising from the White Paper; greater clarity and accessibility to legislation through a rolling programme of statute law revision; the development and publication last July of guidelines on consultation to assist not only those public servants who may be running consultation processes, but also those parties who may be interested in participating in consultation processes; and the introduction in June this year of regulatory impact analysis, RIA.</P>
        <P>Many of our EU partners and the European Commission have had various models of RIA in place for several years. The introduction of RIA in Ireland was a key commitment in the White Paper. We have adopted a model of RIA that has been tailored &mdash; following a pilot process &mdash; to take account of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory environment and best practice elsewhere.</P>
        <P>RIA is an assessment of the likely effects of a proposed new regulation or regulatory change. It involves a detailed analysis to ascertain whether a proposed new regulation will have the desired impact. It also helps to identify any unintended effects or hidden costs associated with regulation. Impact assessment is widely recognised as an important means of achieving better regulation, by improving the quality of analysis and consultation that takes place before decisions are made.</P>
        <P>Following a Government decision on 21 June this year, RIA is now to be applied to all new proposals for primary legislation that involve changes to the regulatory framework and to significant statutory instruments as well as to draft EU directives and significant EU draft regulations when these are published. The latter will contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating position on proposed EU legislation, by highlighting effects and costs that could have particular implications for the State.</P>
        <P>Better regulation is one aspect of the wider public service modernisation programme and my Department has lead responsibility for supporting and progressing implementation of the better regulation agenda. My Department was involved in the development of the Irish model of regulatory impact analysis and chaired the steering group of Departments that piloted the RIA model. The findings of the steering group and the experiences of the pilot process were central to the decision by Government to introduce RIA across all Departments and Government offices from 21 June this year. There are many benefits to RIA and these are clearly set out in the report on the introduction of regulatory impact analysis, published by my Department in July.</P>
        <P>While responsibility for conducting a regulatory impact analysis falls to the relevant Departments considering the introduction of legislation, <Col N="19"/>or which may have lead responsibility in specific sectoral areas, my Department is providing support and advice in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what that lengthy reply means. In 1991 the Competition Authority was established, in 1993 the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2001, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and in 2002, ComReg. In 1989 the Health and Safety Authority was set up and in 2001, the Health Insurance Authority. In that year, also, we had the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and in 2004 the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, was established in 2003 and the National Taxi Regulator in 2004.</P>
        <P>That is a complete set of small empires that have an important duty to perform. I understand that. Will the Taoiseach not agree that there is a case for a single really powerful regulator, which could benefit from economies of scale as well as the pooling of knowledge and expertise and which employs a more focused degree of accountability to all of these areas that must surely benefit consumers in every stratum of society? In its report, the OECD identified two specific areas, telecoms and energy, as being of particular concern. Does the Taoiseach agree that progress in both areas has been dismal and that, as a consequence, the nation is losing in so far as regulation is concerned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If I can separate the issues, the legislation listed by the Deputy covers a broad range of specialist areas. IFSRA was established for a particular reason in the financial area, likewise the Health and Safety Authority and many of the other regulatory bodies.</P>
        <P>I will deal first with regulatory impact analysis before coming to the issue of a super-regulator. Under regulatory impact analysis, before introducing legislation, statutory instruments or new powers the issue is examined to find out if there is another simpler way of dealing with it, whether more bureaucracy is needed or if legislation is already in place which takes the issue into account so that we end up with fewer rules and less regulation. There are areas, including health and safety, for which one must have regulators. For example, IFSRA is needed for financial reasons and prudential control of the country. The purpose of this analysis is to ensure legislation is as simple as possible. The solution to every problem is not more regulation and legislation. At some of the meetings and discussions on this issue I attended people asked if this type of analysis did not always take place. It does not because over the years people sat down and decided to regulate to solve problems. Later on, however, nobody implemented much of the regu<Col N="20"/>lation. The aim is at least to have a process in place.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point on having a super-regulator is different and has some merit. The recommendations to merge a number of regulators and create a larger, multi-sector regulatory body was made by the enterprise strategy group last year in its report, Ahead of the Curve. The recommendation was considered by the better regulation group and discussed at some length under the chairmanship of my Department which is tasked with implementing the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The White Paper recognises the value of ongoing assessment of the possibilities of rationalising the present system. My Department accepts that strengthening ties between the regulators and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Competition Authority would be beneficial. Some cost savings would arise from the super-regulator approach by having shared facilities and expertise but, according to officials of my Department, given the disparate nature of some of the functions that independent regulators deal with, from licensing to travel agents to the building of new power stations, the extent of the potential synergies may be over-stated. The matter should still be examined. The question of the public and political accountability of any super-regulator would also need careful consideration.</P>
        <P>The debate about the number of regulators sometimes misses the point because the real issue is the quality of the decision making by regulators. Are we getting better outcomes in key regulated areas? This will be the debate in the future. Is it better to have experts acting as regulators and, if not, why not? Are the regulators fulfilling their functions both in respect of the players in the market and consumers? Do regulators have sufficient powers and clear mandates? Can we strengthen their powers of sanction? Can we limit recourse to the courts by parties wishing to frustrate regulatory decisions made in the public interest?</P>
        <P>The view of my Department is that answering these questions is a difficult task and the solutions are likely to go beyond the simple issue of the number of regulators. After all, I do not want to be here in a couple of years addressing the problem of overly powerful super-regulators or, for that matter, anybody else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It worries me that the solution in almost every area is to get a regulator. This brings up a mass of issues. It is worth posing questions about the quality of decisions. Things have become more complex. Is the quality of decisions much greater than it used to be? The issue is complex and I accept that in some areas there is a huge amount of data, presentations and issues.</P>
        <P>We cannot have a regulator in every single area and will have to try to give regulators multiple roles. Even if the population in 15 years is 5 million, it will not be huge. Do we need to end up with 30 or 40 regulators? I doubt it so there is merit in the super-regulator idea. I assure Deputy Kenny that the issue is being addressed by the better regulation group.</P>

	<P>Although I inadvertently gave the Taoiseach prior notice of one of my two supplementary questions, he did not answer the question I posed earlier. I apologised to the Chair out of turn. I will put the question again. Does the Taoiseach recall that when he launched the report at the introduction of regulatory impact analysis in July last, he also announced the establishment of a new business regulation group and, in doing so, spoke of the burdens on the business community in terms of regulation? What does the Taoiseach understand or believe these burdens to be?</P>
        <P>Regarding the business regulation group, will it include members of professional bodies such as barristers and solicitors? Does the Taoiseach not agree that where the legal profession is concerned, the problem is not regulation by the State but the fact that its professionals are self-regulating and a law unto themselves? Does he share the widespread concern at the apparent double charging of residential abuse victims by members of the legal profession? What are the implications of these revelations for regulation of the legal profession? Given that many more issues of questionable practice by solicitors arise, will the Taoiseach require, as I believe to be necessary, that the spotlight of inquiry be turned on the legal profession and the practices of solicitors, rather than accommodating many of them, particularly some for whom greed is obviously one of their primary interests?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="22"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will announce the composition and membership of the business regulation forum very shortly. Once the announcement is made, the forum will immediately become operational, all arrangements have been put in place. It is envisaged that the forum will advise the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on regulatory issues as they impact on business and competitiveness and, in particular, on problems arising from outdated, inefficient and disproportionate regulation. The group will examine areas where business can be more competitive so that we can keep Ireland at the cutting edge of leading technologies and business and ensure we are not disadvantaged by competitiveness gains made against us in other European countries or parts of the world. It will be a very useful group.</P>
        <P>The business regulation forum is a separate issue from the issue of professions raised by the Deputy. The Competition Authority is nearing the end of its reports on some of the professions, including one on the legal profession. These are the issues the Deputy raises. The study will take account of practices, including some of those over which the Deputy correctly stated the professions are self-regulatory and control their own terms and rules. There are issues in the public domain on those matters at present and, as I stated recently, if they are not sorted out then the issue of legislation will arise. I hope they can be sorted out within their own terms.</P>
        <P>We must deal with the issues that arise from the competitiveness council&rsquo;s final report. It has spent years working on this. It has issued interim reports, on eight professions as I recall, and its remaining reports are to be issued before Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On regulatory reform, has the Government a definition of the role of a regulator in the sense of whether he or she will be primarily a <i>status quo</i> caretaker or an agent for change, for example, a transformer, as one might say, in the case of the energy regulator, to a less carbon intensive energy system in this country? Does the Government have a view of where the driver for change will be? Is it with the regulator or with the Minister, and does the latter thereby have a role in ensuring the regulator is co-operating in that regard?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach indicated in his reply that part of the regulatory impact analysis was to highlight costs. In what way does he measure the costs? In the case of the groceries order, for example, is the cost the loss of farmers, small retailers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question to the line Minister concerned might be more appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="23"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the opportunity because I see the line Minister is listening carefully, but I want to ask the Taoiseach specifically because in his reply he said that the regulatory impact analysis was to look at costs. I want to know what he meant by that. If one abolishes the groceries order, the cost is high in terms of loss of small-scale retailers and food producers and I want to know whether that is included in his analysis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to go into what the RIA means but there is a need for more competition in the domestic market in many areas because that will drive down costs to the advantage of consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it only costs to consumers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the cost base. With more competition, the cost base will improve. It will help everybody. The cost base of the country will help competitiveness, primarily consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Not everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To give a fuller position on it, there are many issues where RIA comes into play, for example, significant negative impacts on national competitiveness or socially excluded or vulnerable groups, examination of significant environment change, significant policy change in an economic market will have a significant impact on competition and consumers, proposals that will disproportionately impinge on the rights of citizens or impose a disproportionate compliance burden, or the cost to the Exchequer or third parties is significant or disproportionate. A full RIA will be required when one of the factors to which I referred applies and these are the factors that will drive an RIA. When these difficulties arise, an RIA will be done.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the forces of change. We all have a role to play &mdash; Ministers, Departments, State agencies and the regulators &mdash; in bringing change and looking at new ideas. The regulator is in a position where those whom he regulates make detailed reports to him. These are the substantial reports on how they want to act and why they are doing so. He then must determine whether a report is one to which he is prepared to accede and whether it makes sense. He has a key role in all that. He is not the only one to decide the matter but he has a useful role to play in it.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have called Deputy Rabbitte and out of courtesy to colleagues in the House, Deputy Eamon Ryan should allow the Deputy called to submit his question.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>To return to the recommendation of Ahead of the Curve, the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s recommendation for a super regulator, and the contrary view taken by the group in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, is the Taoiseach saying that the view of his group is that there should be no rationalisation of the existing 11 regulators or merely that it did not agree with the particular recommendation of Ahead of the Curve?</P>
        <P>I am reminded by the entry to the House of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, of the marvellous headline the T&aacute;naiste received in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 April 2001, &ldquo;Government to abolish curbs on pubs and pharmacies&rdquo; within a year. Is there any progress to report on that and did the Minister of State make any recommendations on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Rabbitte wish to abolish pharmacies? Is that what he is saying?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not. Unfortunately, I had to resort to them in recent weeks.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy submitted a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, he would not have the <Col N="25"/>Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, intervening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle has a point. On the Competition Authority and the various reports, lectures etc., what tangibly has been achieved? If there are anti-competitive practices in this economy, as is alleged, and there is anti-competitive activity to the extent suggested in certain significant sectors, why have more prosecutions not been advanced? Why has more action not been taken? For example, the only two cases that have gone to court are the one on pet food for chihuahuas and the one on the Irish League of Credit Unions. If I were seriously interested in tackling alleged anti-competitive activity in the financial services sector, I would not start with the credit unions. There are a number of other sectors I could mention. After all the fine lectures, the high profile public statements, etc. is it a little odd that it seems difficult to get a file to progress as far as taking on a particular dominant influence in several markets I could mention?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of points were raised. For the reasons I have given, it was the view of the cross-departmental better regulation group that at this stage a super regulator was not the way to go. While that was the conclusion it reached for the reasons I have given, it was not entirely ruled out in that as new regulators came into play, they would be grouped where there was a suitable mix. Rather than having a separate regulator each time, wherever the group believed there was capacity, they would match them. The cross-departmental better regulation group went against the proposal of a super regulator, which Ahead of the Curve recommended. The RIA process has been in place since 21 June. Therefore, all new regulations and statutory instruments are being examined to see if there is another or better way to do them. That process is happening in all Departments and my Department assists any that need assistance. That part is done and under way.</P>
        <P>The third point raised by the Deputy concerns a question that arises on another day. It is later down the line and concerns the Competition Authority&rsquo;s examination of the professions. The authority has provided preliminary and draft reports on a number of professions. Final reports, including that on pharmacists, are on the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is a bit behind on the deadline of 25 April 2001, is she not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The report on the legal profession is also on the way. There were eight <Col N="26"/>reports in all and two or three final reports are coming forward. The senior person in the authority has moved, but most of the work was done before he left. These reports are to be finalised before the Christmas period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will have much reading to do, for a man unaccustomed to reading.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not so much the reading that will be a challenge, but the implementation of the reports. We look forward to that because based on the interim reports, there will be some interesting challenges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to tease out with the Taoiseach the issue of the energy regulator. Is it not true the regulator, who previously as a civil servant had written the legislation that set up the regulatory office, established the office in such a way that the Minister cannot direct him on specific policy directions the office needs to take, whether on the issue of security of supply, where we have a huge threat with regard to peak and global oil production, on the issue of cost of energy, where we currently see huge cost increases, or environmental issues with regard to the future of climate change implications and energy policy? Is that not the reason legislation is pending which will amend the regulatory role to allow the Minister have a say? Does the Taoiseach think it was appropriate to give a regulator such freedom that the Minister cannot give directions to him or her?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department is the policy initiator. The point I was making is that the Department does not want to be involved in the day to day decisions, but policy direction should rest with the Department, not with the agency. If the Deputy asked should a Department give away all its powers of influence to a regulator, I do not think it should.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Taoiseach acknowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not interrupt the Taoiseach while he is speaking. The Deputy will have an opportunity to put a supplementary question. I ask the Deputy to resume his seat while the Taoiseach is on his feet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s argument is that the Minister&rsquo;s powers are gone and he does not have a say. With regard to either gas or electricity legislation, the policy work is still done within the Department but the regulator decides what movements are made in the market, for example, price increases and capital developments. The <Col N="27"/>regulator makes those decisions but that does not take away from the role of the Department and its input into policy. Departments are not involved in day to day direction of a regulator, nor can they overrule a regulator&rsquo;s report. However, the initial policy is made within the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I not correct that in this particular area the Minister cannot issue directions to the regulator on issues such as pricing? While the Taoiseach is right that the Department should have the ultimate say, the reality is that the legislation defines where the power lies. In this case the legislation does not allow the Minister to give directions on policy matters to the regulator. Is that not correct and is this not the reason we are amending the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is right. However, the initial policy in an area is devised by the Department. When a regulator issues a report, a Minister cannot change or direct that report, but he can set policy. The Deputy will say that this moves on into the regulator&rsquo;s report and he cannot change that. The regulator, however, cannot just go ahead and ignore the legislation or policy issued by the Department.</P>

	<P>I would like to ask about another fraudulent document. I was not successful, obviously, when I requested the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the matter. Given that companies can fold and then re-open without paying their bills and brazen out legal cases so they can bankrupt subcontractors, it seems the prompt payments legislation needs to be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the quarterly national household survey results. It is important sometimes to reflect on our achievements and to pause for a moment to understand what is happening in our economy. The figures published by the Central Statistics Office last month tell a compelling story of transformation.</P>
      <P>I pose an important question to the House. What does an increase of 400,000 in jobs since 1997 tell us? It tells me that we have put in place the right enterprise policies to build a strong economy. Through lower taxes we have given individuals more choice over how to spend their incomes and we have nurtured a culture of enterprise where people with new ideas are not stymied at every turn. In a decade, our very approach to risk takers has changed. No longer is the only option for entrepreneurs to emigrate to innovate. Ireland has been transformed from a country where many young people had to leave to find jobs to one where young people from across the globe are contributing to our economy. We have implemented broad economic polices that have changed the business environment. This is not just our own analysis. After eight consistent years of managed growth and prosperity, the International Monetary Fund is still able to commend Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;continued impressive economic performance, the result of sound economic policies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not begin eight years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures from the latest quarterly national household survey are marked proof <Col N="38"/>of the effectiveness of Government policies in the areas of employment and the labour market. Our recent economic success has been remarkable. The so-called &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo; of the early 1990s has long since been replaced by consistent employment creation. Employment increased by 93,000 in the 12 months to August 2005, bringing the total at work to 1,929,000. This is the highest annual growth rate in five years and is an increase of 31% or 461,000 since 1997. Women have particularly benefited from the massive growth in employment during this period. The number of women in the workforce has increased by 39% since 1997 as against the 26% increase in male workers. More needs to be done if we are to continue to attract women into the workforce. In addition the figures show a strong regional performance, with employment in the Border, midlands and west region increasing by almost 6%, giving employment to an additional 26,000 people. Moreover, we have seen employment increase in most sectors of the economy, with financial and business services showing strong growth.</P>
      <P>This strong employment growth has been based on a strong and vibrant economy. With favourable economic growth forecast to continue, the indications are that employment growth will be maintained in 2005 and into 2006. Employment is forecast to grow by around 2.9% in 2005 and by 2% in 2006. Unemployment continues to be maintained at a low level at 4.2% and is forecast to remain at around this level into next year. Our unemployment rate is currently less than half the EU average of 8.6%. Our current rate compares to an unemployment rate of 10.4% in 1997. The numbers unemployed have decreased by 50% in this period, from 171,200 to 85,600. Long­term unemployment has dropped from 90,000 to 27,000, a decrease of almost 70%. It now stands at 1.4%, which is about one third of the EU average.</P>
      <P>The consensus approach under social partnership, involving employers, employees and Government, has been a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s economic success. This has been backed by a well-balanced suite of employment rights legislation, which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provide an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment. In addition to employment growth, the partnership agreements have been effective in securing improved economic performance and, above all, raising living standards. In the ten years to 1987 inflation was running at an average of 12% whereas the current rate is just 3%. Moreover, the pay terms of the two most recent national agreements have given workers pay increases of almost 30%.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to implement policies that lead to higher levels of employment. We will <Col N="39"/>strive to reach and if possible exceed the EU employment rate targets for 2010 of 70% for overall employment, 60% for female employment and 50% for employment of older workers. As pointed out by the enterprise strategy group, the policies adopted to date have proved very successful. However, if we are to move forward in the context of a knowledge based, innovation driven economy, a new set of challenges awaits us which require a different approach. In the labour market context this means we need to maintain a strong focus on education and training, including lifelong learning, to ensure the development of a high skilled, adaptable workforce. We need to ensure an adequate supply of labour to meet the needs of the economy and to sustain economic growth. Labour will be supplied through a number of sources: the underlying population increase; increased participation by the unemployed and those outside the labour force; and economic migration.</P>
      <P>Education and training have been central to our economic success. Similarly, our future prosperity will depend on workers acquiring the knowledge, skills and competencies required to compete in an increasingly global economy. The enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s recommendations made it clear that lifelong learning will be key, as the nature of the workplace requires that workers be ever more flexible and adaptable. More than in the past, people will need to upskill and reskill throughout their working lives. This can only be achieved by introducing new approaches and putting in place the necessary delivery structures. The One Step Up initiative, which I announced recently and have substantially resourced, is an important element in this process. This initiative will promote life-long learning and upskilling of our workforce by providing easy access to a range of training and learning initiatives, including both tutor-led training and e-learning. It will also assist employees to obtain a recognised qualifications within the national framework of qualifications.</P>
      <P>In ensuring an adequate supply of labour to increase the numbers at work in the context of the decreasing numbers of young people coming into the labour market, there will always be a need to mobilise labour supply from other sources. This will mean encouraging increased participation in the domestic labour market. It will also mean adjusting economic migration policy in Ireland to address identified labour shortages and skills needs.</P>
      <P>Migration, combined with the natural increase in the population, has resulted in an increase in the population by 87,000 to more than 4 million in April 2005, the highest it has been in nearly 150 years. This is truly a historic milestone. This is a very positive trend for Ireland in view of our labour and skills shortages. The high level of immigration in the past year, with over a third <Col N="40"/>coming from the ten new member states, is a result of our non-restrictive policy to those from these countries who wish to work in Ireland. There is no doubt that for most of our skills shortages, appropriate EEA workers are available.</P>
      <P>The total population today is the highest since the census of 1861. The historic nature of this population increase should not be lost sight of. Demographers agree that if there had been no emigration since 1841, the population of the Republic would be in the region of 20 million instead of 4.13 million today. It is interesting to note that P&aacute;draig Pearse believed the country could support a population of 30 million. These figures may be fanciful to us today and we would have an entirely different economy but, nonetheless, we have turned a corner in terms of the history of population growth in this country.</P>
      <P>The Employment Permits Bill 2005, which I introduced in the D&aacute;il last week, includes provision for a more managed economic migration policy, including a continual assessment of skill and labour needs in future. Research carried out by the expert group on future skills needs will continue to inform Government policy in this field. The focus of this policy will be to facilitate efficiently and effectively the entry into Ireland of people with skills we need but which we cannot source from within Ireland or the European Economic Area. The high growth in employment indicates how well the economy is doing and how important it is that we can absorb increases in the labour force both on the domestic front and from overseas.</P>
      <P>In the space of fewer than 15 years, we have built a very different economy that has the inherent capacity to sustain growth rates that are the envy of some and a sought after example for others. At the root of this exceptional employment performance is a deeply embedded commitment to pursue policies across Government that boost our competitiveness. This is underpinned by recognising that we must constantly change, adapt and reform if we are to stay ahead.</P>
      <P>I am realistic enough to know that keeping, let alone expanding, our share of world trade and investment will not be easy. Our competitors are no more than a mouse click away. Competitiveness is as easily lost as it has been hard won. While we are no longer a low cost economy, the recent annual report from the National Competitiveness Council recognises that we retain some fairly impressive and significant national strengths.</P>
      <P>For example, we have achieved remarkable rates of economic growth over the past decade and we have recorded one of the best economic performances in the world. From 1997 to 2004, Irish gross domestic product grew by an average of more than 7.5% compared with an average of just over 2% in the European Union 15. Under <Col N="41"/>the sustainable growth heading, Ireland&rsquo;s living standards, as measured by GDP <i>per capita</i>, the National Competitiveness Council calculates we come first out of 15 countries, and for gross national product <i>per capita</i>, we are sixth out of 16 economies at which it looked. GNP<i> per capita</i> has almost doubled since 1997.</P>
      <P>However, it is not all about arcane economic numbers. Real progress has been achieved in improving living standards and this is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s strong performance in the United Nations human development index that is a good indicator of general quality of life. Here we came fifth out of 15 comparable countries. In addition to the decline in unemployment and long-term unemployment in particular, the ESRI has shown that over the period 1994 to 2001, life chances improved significantly. This trend is directly related to declining unemployment and reduced levels of dependence on social welfare in a period of economic boom.</P>
      <P>Maintaining our competitiveness is of huge importance for Ireland because we are one of the most open economies in the world. In terms of trade performance, we came second out of 16 nations in the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s league table, with much of this driven by our strengths in the foreign investment sector. We have one of the most favourable taxation regimes in Europe and have put in place enterprise policies that support all investors. This makes Ireland a secure and profitable location from which to do business globally. The combined effect of these policy strands has ensured that Ireland has consistently been an attractive location for foreign direct investment for a considerable period and we have successfully won more global and EU foreign direct investment than our size would naturally suggest.</P>
      <P>Our commitment to developing a modern high technology and competitive economy is winning where it counts, that is, in the marketplace. The export performance of the high technology sector is powered by the skill and ingenuity of a productive and competitive workforce. Chemical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, electronic and electronic commerce sectors would not consistently choose Ireland as an investment location if we did not provide solid competitive advantages. We all know that global competition for prestige and high value mobile investment is intense, yet global businesses continually choose to invest here because we are competitive for these high end industries. Hard nosed investment decisions are not made in favour of uncompetitive and lowly rated economies.</P>
      <P>Not only is foreign direct investment critical to maintaining economic vitality, how we manage the transition to a different portfolio of foreign investors is a key challenge that we meet. Manufacturing is still the engine driving our economy and represents by far the greater part of the <Col N="42"/>exports of &euro;68 billion and local economy expenditure of &euro;15 billion by overseas companies in Ireland each year. However, the type of manufacturing investment being secured for Ireland has changed. Many western-type economies are seeing a gradual loss of low level, labour intensive operations to lower cost countries, but innovative economies like Ireland continue to attract advanced manufacturing operations that are at the cutting edge of technology, where high productivity output is heavily reliant on the skills and capability of a highly educated and agile workforce. These investments may not have the headline grabbing head count of previous years but their massive capital investment per employee shows that we are serious contenders when it comes to winning sophisticated, technology driven, mobile investment. We will continue to encourage manufacturing. It provides the test bed for innovation and ingenuity. Developing new products, creating new processes and achieving greater productivity is an integral part of manufacturing today.</P>
      <P>Helping us further along the road of transformation, the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s analysis of our enterprise performance made a very strong case. It showed us how and where we need to be creative in policy thought and deed. I spoke about the One Step Up initiative and the upskilling of the workforce and population. This is one part of our response to the enterprise strategy group.</P>
      <P>A second key plank in our response to the O&rsquo;Driscoll report has been the new Enterprise Ireland strategy to help transform indigenous enterprise. The vision set out in the strategy is the support and creation of a dynamic indigenous firms sector engaged in high value added activities. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients will become more intensely market focused and innovative, providing new and proprietary products at premium prices. The strategy has a heavy emphasis on research and innovation, exports, competitiveness and entrepreneurship to deliver greater numbers of new high growth companies with strong potential to win increasingly profitable contracts in global markets. It aims to help Irish companies grow into self-sustaining enterprises of sufficient scale to compete internationally.</P>
      <P>Driving the competitiveness agenda and keeping us ahead of the curve was very much at the heart of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s recommendations. We have a broad and diversified enterprise base that has expanded with the help of constructive economic and business policies and we have one of the best possible international locations from which to do business. I want to keep it this way and I am determined we maintain this competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>Sustaining the momentum for change and reform demands a close dialogue with business. I recently announced the business members of the <Col N="43"/>enterprise advisory group who will advise Government on the implementation of the enterprise strategy group recommendations and on enterprise policy generally.</P>
      <P>Globalisation provides huge opportunities for companies with international ambitions but it is also presenting unprecedented competitive pressures. I fully agree with the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report when it describes the new emphasis we should place on building strong indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises. Through Enterprise Ireland we are designing a new approach to helping SMEs but I do not believe changing our support schemes is sufficient. Ten years ago, the growth issues for small companies were very different and a small firms task force presented radical and important reforms that helped small companies mature and capitalise on economic expansion. Today SMEs face very different but no less difficult problems about growth and expansion in a world transformed by freer trade and massive competition.</P>
      <P>We have made a very clear commitment to the need for a substantial step change in research and development, building on the outstanding success we have had since 1998 in that area. We need to change step again to bring Ireland into the next decade. In recent weeks, there has been much comment about the establishment of a variety of groups. It is effective that Ireland Inc. has looked strategically in consulting with people and has developed strategic frameworks for policy formulation. People criticise, in a shallow way, the establishment of strategic groups to look ten years ahead. It is a dangerous debate that is without substance. If we adopt that approach, we will do so at our peril.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was curious about why this item was put on today&rsquo;s agenda but now I know. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment felt he would not have sufficient time next week at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis in Killarney to say all he did today. We are getting a preview of his ard-fheis speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A very dry one at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>He will get more time at the ard-fheis.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office reports the population has breached the 4 million mark, standing at 4.13 million people. However, there is much comment as to the true population level. Once upon a time, in his previous portfolio, the Minister got into difficulty with sums over medical cards and the numbers of people over 70 years of age. It turned out to be a much different figure than was originally estimated. We are not exactly sure of the true level of migration into the coun<Col N="44"/>try or population growth, as it varies from one particular study to the other.</P>
      <P>Following the Famine of the 1840s, and the almost relentless flight of people from the land, we can look to inward migration as a sign that Ireland has finally come of age. Hard and painful economic reforms, arising from the bad old days of the 1980s were needed. Much progress has been made in the economy by successive governments in ensuring economic growth, development and employment opportunities for our people. We are richer, more confident, outward looking and self-assured.</P>
     <?oasys _dc20-?> <P>However, a series of key challenges remain that we are simply not facing. We have enough reports at this stage to implement, particularly the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report, Ahead of the Curve. I was critical that another layer of business people was needed to implement recommendations already made through the existing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are the recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There were many recommendations in the excellent report by Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll and his team. However, we do not need to see another implementation body but action. The Minister is now beginning to take some action.</P>
      <P>According to the Forf&aacute;s expert group on future skills needs, the list of professions facing a skills shortage is mind-boggling. It includes bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters, floorers, painters and decorators, accountants, actuaries, financial analysts, investment and risk analysts, fund managers, engineers, welders, computer analysts, chemical engineers, doctors, dentists, dieticians, social workers, credit controllers and warehousemen. These professions have been identified as suffering skills shortages by Forf&aacute;s, an agency that advises the Minister. F&Aacute;S has also identified these shortages, another organisation advising the Minister.</P>
      <P>As the economy grows, so too will the need for policies that will fill these gaps and create the necessary supply of workers for the future economic development of the State. Many reports have been published on skills needs because we have failed to plan ahead for these shortages. With economic growth in the last 15 years at an average of 7%, it was and is incumbent on the government of the day to plan ahead in infrastructure, competitiveness and skills requirements. We are now playing catch-up and the Minister recently took an initiative on up-skilling.</P>
      <P>A situation where only some categories of the population are up-skilled is not needed. If that happens, there will be an unemployable group of people at the bottom due to educational drop-out levels in the lower socio-economic groups. The education system has a role to play. We do not want to see people dropping out of education, <Col N="45"/>particularly at second level, to the extent they are now. This is a worrying trend that requires joined-up thinking in Government policy. Education will play a major role again, as it did in the 1960s, in driving the enterprise agenda.</P>
      <P>There are 137,000 migrant workers working in Ireland, 7% of the workforce. Between 2000 to 2005, over 100,000 persons from outside the EEA came to Ireland for employment purposes. This is in addition to the substantial numbers of EEA nationals, with estimates of over 90,000 having applied for PPS numbers since 1 May 2004. The legislative infrastructure to maintain this situation does not exist, although the new Bill on employment permits will go some way in addressing this problem.</P>
      <P>The Immigration Council of Ireland has pointed out that a two tier system of migrant workers has developed and is being perpetuated. On the one hand, there are those on work visas, generally in better jobs, with their families by their side, better paid and valued by the State. On the other, there are individuals, with no families, lower paid and not here in their own right, but rather in the gift of their employers. The legislation the Minister recently published goes some way towards addressing this.</P>
      <P>There is some confusion about the Minister&rsquo;s proposed green card system, however, particularly as we are used to the US system. That green card system gives the individual the right to search for work, apply for residency and aspire to citizenship. The recently published legislation has not gone that far. I remind the Minister that Forf&aacute;s stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">While the EU and EEA counties will provide a substantial proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s low skill requirements, continued non-EEA immigration will be needed to meet some of Ireland&rsquo;s high skill demands over the next number of years.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Ireland is new to inward migration. We have the almost unique opportunity to avoid the pitfalls of the US and the UK where an enormous underclass of immigrants and their children has developed. The plight of the Irish emigrant in the UK is one we do not want to see happening here. In these countries, an entire generation has grown up knowing nothing but social deprivation and poverty. The link is made to the fact they are of foreign parents and their situation is often linked to the colour of their skin or their religion. As a result, an almost ingrained distrust of state institutions, including the police, becomes the norm. As with all communities suffering poverty, crime can become rife. The misconception that immigrant communities are inherently more crime ridden than the native born population begins to find favour. People coming to our shores who gain employment must also be integrated as part of our society to head off the race problems seen <Col N="46"/>in other jurisdictions. This will not happen by accident and the education system will have a role to play in ensuring people are tolerant of migrants.</P>
      <P>Figures in the quarterly national household survey paint a rosy picture overall but there are some worrying trends. The number of people classified as unemployed has risen, while those employed in both agriculture and manufacturing continue to decline. The Fine Gael Party has called on the Government to adopt an action plan for both these sectors of the economy. As an economy or a society, we cannot exist within the service sector. We must do what we can to maintain a manufacturing base because it is the key to spin-off development of ancillary services and industries. We must not allow the flight from the land to continue unabated. We must find roles for people in agriculture or on the land to play in the development of rural communities. We cannot leave the people employed in those sectors to the vagaries of globalisation.</P>
      <P>I note a recent comment on manufacturing that the continuing decline illustrates the competitiveness challenge facing Irish industry as a result of the increases in non-pay costs such as energy and waste management in particular. The Government has a role to play in making Ireland a more attractive place for Irish people to work and do business by addressing those issues of competitiveness. I differ from the Government&rsquo;s version of events in that I believe it has allowed the competitiveness agenda to slip. We were fourth in the OECD world competitiveness forum rankings in 2000. We are now 26th, which is evidence that we have slipped.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised in numerous studies that there is a competition deficit in this country. Across key sectors of the economy, including many directly controlled by the State, there is an absence of a competitive dynamic that would provide consumers of services with a wide choice. The former chairman of the Competition Authority, Mr. Fingleton, whose position is now vacant, outlined the scale of concentration resulting from the legacy of an anti-competitive and anti-consumer policy and culture. In particular he highlighted core areas of the economy where there are high levels of concentration and where consumers do not have adequate competition and choice. He outlined the presence of effective State monopolies in the postal service, energy, transport, health insurance, television and forestry. He also outlined other sectors where leading private sector firms have a market share of 50% or more, leading to concentration. There is one sector in particular where four firms alone control more than 80% of the market.</P>
      <P>These are key issues for the provision to the consumer of better services, such as legal services, energy and waste management, at a cheaper cost. We must address them on behalf of the users of <Col N="47"/>those services. Poor competition in the provision of goods and services adds to the daily living costs for consumers and businesses, especially small businesses. The Competition Act 1991 was reviewed in 2002 but could go much further in dealing with the issues.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the Government&rsquo;s policy of having a regulator for everything. Even the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform got in on the act yesterday for auctioneers and estate agents. I understand the direction in which he wants to go to protect the consumer but we should not allow empire building by one regulator after another where no cross-cutting issues are discussed or developed between them. Each of the regulators&rsquo; offices has a separate legal department, a separate accountancy department and other separate sections for a wide variety of consumer issues.</P>
      <P>The Commission for Electricity Regulation is suffering enormously from regulatory capture. Most of the people involved in it were civil servants in the former Department of Energy. A cosy relationship has developed in some sectors of competition policy between regulators and the industry they are supposed to be independently assessing so that new competition is brought into the marketplace. That independent assessment is not happening and Government policy on how regulation operates needs to be reviewed urgently.</P>
      <P>Approximately half the workforce is not in a pension scheme. This is a challenge. Figures from the Irish Association of Pension Funds show the average contribution to pension schemes is<?oasys _jy?>10%. However, to maintain an adequate income in retirement, the figure should be more like 15% to 25%. The Government is discussing this issue at present and I expect it will have a statement to make on the matter in the context of the forthcoming budget. It is another issue for which we must plan ahead.</P>
      <P>If we want to plan for an enlarged population we should not repeat the mistakes of the past where there was no policy for migration, infrastructural development, pension contributions or competitiveness issues. We need a co-ordinated approach to plan the migration of people into this country to enlarge its population. Good progress has been made but major challenges lie ahead and we must meet them if we are to ensure we can compete with countries in the Far East and eastern Europe and continue to enjoy strong economic growth for the benefit of the people we represent who work and live here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Burton. Like Deputy Hogan I was surprised to see this item on the Order Paper because there are many pressing matters in the legislative sphere for the House to give its attention to. The <Col N="48"/>question was answered when the Minister gave his speech. As somebody who is an admirer of the Minister&rsquo; s ability I was disappointed with the speech. His use of stark statistical analysis of where this country and society are going and his litany of self-congratulatory facts did him no justice.</P>
      <P>We all share in the success story that is Ireland which Members on all sides of the House had a hand in creating. We do not all claim credit for it at every opportunity. More important for people listening to this debate and for policymakers is how we address the extraordinary challenges and opportunities of the demographic projections presented in this analysis.</P>
      <P>There are some starkly worrying issues. The population of greater Dublin will continue to dominate. Mr. Frank McDonald, who has been a commentator on these matters for a long time, summarises that we are creating a city state. Greater Dublin is projected to have more than 40% of the population in 2021 and will so dominate Ireland in terms of infrastructure and economic activity that it will not be healthy for the organisation of a balanced country.</P>
      <P>There have been debates in this House and the Government has made detailed statements on its spatial strategy. What does it mean? We learn new words like gateways and hubs but that is all we know about them. It reminds me of the RAPID programme, where the Government, to pretend it was doing something about inequality, re-labelled normal Government expenditure as socially focused expenditure. What specifically is being done about spatial planning in this country? Where are the driven Government strategies to develop regional centres and to ensure that the infrastructure and jobs go to those regional centres?</P>
      <P>In reality the development of Ireland, of which the Minister is so proud, is not being planned in a rational way by Government or by these Houses. It is developer-led. Developers determine where population is to grow by planning and building houses. The whole planning process is overwhelmed by it. In my county the best efforts of forward planning are undermined by the requirement to deal with current applications that are being made in large volumes as developers seek to make profits. If we do not exert control over the strategy, we will pay dearly for it in decades to come.</P>
      <P>The statistics for migration patterns are stark in the volumes they predict. There will be at least 30,000 new migrants per year for the next 19 or 20 years, and that is a conservative estimate. We seem to have no strategy for dealing with an evolving society. My colleague Deputy Burton has an even more direct experience of this. Society in towns, villages, urban areas and constituencies as a whole is changing, but in an almost haphazard way.</P><Col N="49"/>
      <P>The economy needs workers so we invite them in, particularly from new EU member states, but there is no structure for integration. People are struggling to come to terms with the changing pattern of worker in our society. We do not have an overall plan for integration to ensure we are bedding down a balanced society that will create, as I mentioned last week, a new and different Irish community instead of ghettoising people because they have an economic short-term value and then rejecting them. I do not see any sense to this, and I had hoped the Minister would give some visionary comments to the House today in his contribution on these important matters.</P>
      <P>An overwhelming issue is the need for joined up Government. I do not see sense in attempts at this either. The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business had a stark presentation from Mr. Eddie Shaw of the National Safety Council this morning. If the Minister reads his contribution, he will find robust criticism regarding a lack of joined up Government thinking on road safety. It applies to all issues that are to be dealt with in dealing with a demographic shift that is unprecedented in a century. The National Roads Authority is building roads but it is doing so in a slow and piecemeal fashion, leaving gaps within all our national systems. Where other countries might see the need for a metro in a city such as Dublin and proceed in a structured fashion, we seem to be paralysed by analysis and unable to put basic facilities in place.</P>
      <P>In my county of Wexford, there has been a 12.5% increase in population since the last census, from 1996 to 2002. The increase is geographically narrowly focused in north Wexford and the strip of county on the coast. There is no other planning however. There are two secondary schools in north Wexford, one of which by volume is by far the biggest secondary school in Ireland. That school cannot take any more pupils. The county is trying to catch up, stating the need for a new secondary school in Gorey and the development of Kilmuckridge. However, this is occurring years after the population is in place. People are struggling and there are crazy transport routes ferrying people from north Wexford to Wexford town to receive education. This is because education needs are not being linked with the requirements of the changing population distribution in the country.</P>
      <P>The same can be said about leisure facilities. Houses are built because developers submit planning applications, but the infrastructure is not being put in place to create societies beyond that. A wilderness is often being created instead in the name of profit, which has significant social implications for the future.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is this week publishing a comprehensive document on child care, which I will not discuss in any detail as that will be raised by our spokesman. A number of people, both <Col N="50"/>men and women, are telling us that they are fed up with some aspects of the Celtic tiger, such as endless working hours in the name of productivity. They are fed up with getting up at 6 a.m. and not getting home until late. They are worried about their family life or the lack of contact with their children. These are issues of values that must be discussed in tandem with the Minister&rsquo;s litany of economic progress. We are not an economy but a society. If we think of ourselves exclusively as an economy and think of people as units of work rather than citizens in an evolving society, we will make the wrong decisions. We may make no decisions at all.</P>
      <P>Where are the grand ideas to restructure Ireland? The only new town we built is Ennis, and we did not put in place the resources to meet all the needs of that town when we started. Where are the new cities and towns? Where are the new modes of transport which are required, and where are the new innovative educational facilities that will ensure we do not create the city state that Frank McDonald is mindful of? Have we the strategies to explore the notion of manufacturing jobs being the hub of economic success? Where are the strategies to deal with the loss of manufacturing jobs currently taking place? Where are the plans to ensure all areas of the country benefit equally from the economic progress that has characterised Ireland for the past decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures released by the CSO show further startling increases in population. The answer to my colleague Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s questions about the new cities is that these new cities are already here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They are grafted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They are in a necklace around the western side of the Dublin region. They start at Tallaght and go on to Lucan, Clondalkin, Leixlip, Blanchardstown, Clonee, Dunboyne, Swords and Balbriggan. This does not take into account large areas such as Ashbourne on the fringes. This is where an enormous concentration of the new population is.</P>
      <P>I have the honour of representing Dublin West. The west of Dublin is struggling to deal with what is occurring. This Government mainly has a type of planning led by developers and the building industry, so it is for profit rather than for people. One change in strategy we wish to see is planning which benefits people and communities rather than for the profit of builders and developers. Builders and developers must make money, but they are making it currently at excessive levels on the backs of struggling new communities which are being left bereft.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise it is now easier for somebody in west Dublin to buy a house in <Col N="51"/>Cavan, Duleek or Leitrim, where they may get a tax break with the house? In such locations they get a bigger house on a bigger plot of land. As a result of the lack of transportation within the Dublin West area, they may be faster travelling to Dublin, moving on main roads by car, than if they came from a local Dublin estate. This is because public transport currently available is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, and I stood at Clonsilla railway station last Monday morning at 8 a.m. Pat Kenny discussed the same rail line on his programme yesterday. The people were crammed on the train, and it is locally referred to as the Calcutta express. The cramming is to a point that if a woman is heavily pregnant, she can no longer take the train. The level of overcrowding is dangerous. In the latter years of the rainbow Government, this line was marked for expansion. When the Fianna F&aacute;il and PD coalition Government came into office, the proposals were re-examined, which took three or four years. The expansion, on a modest scale, occurred about a year and a half ago. It took eight years to upgrade this magnificent Victorian inheritance of a full railway line to the west of Dublin.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Meath by-election, a hastily put together study was published on the re-opening of the Dunboyne railway line. Todd Andrews sold the line, so the reinstatement of the line must be planned after the land is bought back. Anyone with experience knows that each of those stages will take several years. Commuters are buying houses and they are being made car dependent by this Government because they cannot buy a house with access to decent public transport or a quality bus corridor.</P>
      <P>There is now a division between the east and west sides of Dublin. The east side is the gold coast and the west side is where ordinary people and immigrants live and people have no public transport. The quality bus corridor into Donnybrook is wonderful. However, it now takes nearly 40 minutes more to get into the centre on a QBC from the west side of Dublin than it did when there was no QBC. This is because the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, cannot release additional buses because he is caught in an ideological problem on whether or not public bus services should exist.</P>

	<P>The focus of the Minister&rsquo;s speech was on what a great economy we have. None of us doubts that jobs are being created all of the time. We should not use the data to sing the praises of the economy, however, without analysing them. There is little reason for gathering them in the first place if we are not going to use them.</P><Col N="52"/>
      <P>We can see from the data there is a significant increase in the number of women participating in the work force. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that there will be increased child care needs. Even though this data is published quarterly, it took a by-election and the opportunity afforded to the public to take ownership of the issue for that issue to be taken seriously. We will see if the issue is dealt with in the budget but there is no doubt that the lack of affordable child care is an impediment to the participation of women in the work force.</P>
      <P>Why do we always have to get to a crisis before we deal with it? We can anticipate it and see it jumping out off the page, as is the case with congestion. All one has to do is go out any morning on to the N1, N2, N3, N4, and the N7. People are living very far away from where they are working, yet the report shows that the lowest level of unemployment is in the mid-east region. People are moving further away from their work place and are struggling with the congestion, which is having a bearing on the quality of their lives and their communities. With women participating to an ever greater extent in the workforce, communities are losing people who would otherwise be volunteering. Resident and voluntary group meetings are dominated by women. If we want to build solid communities, that volunteering time must be replaced in a more structured way.</P>
      <P>When a company is locating its business in an area, the quality of the living environment there has a direct bearing on its decision. Companies such Intel and Hewlett Packard, which are located in my area, tell me exactly that. Child care, transport and accommodation jump out of this report as issues that must be addressed beyond the statistics on who is working, where they are working and the increase in the numbers of those employed.</P>
      <P>About 13 years ago, the Dublin transportation initiative was begun after the Government informed the European Union that congestion was a serious impediment to the progress of the economy. I wish we could only roll back the clock to those levels of congestion because we are seriously beyond the point of gridlock. It typically takes an hour to drive four or miles at peak times, which is absolutely untenable.</P>
      <P>Professor Joe Lee recently spoke about a sense of place and how we had lost it. He said that we had become a nation of consumers and producers, where only one generation was involved, with no place for the old and the young. That is a fair description of what is happening. The public is way ahead on this and people see that there must be a connection between building an economy and building a society. They want to see what the Government claims is a great economy turned into a quality of life, with improved transport, child care and a reduction in accommodation costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister says that we must be strategic and he is right. I would like him to read the comments in <i>The Irish Catholic</i> by the architect of that strategic thinking which brought us economic success, Dr. Ken Whitaker. He said that economic growth does not necessarily lead to a peaceful, civilised or more idealistic society, and that there are values, moral and intellectual, which are higher than mere economics. If only this Government would listen to that strategic thinking. We certainly need wealth but we need it to be shared out so that we can live in a successful, civilised, peaceful society.</P>
      <P>Government Members thought they would have an easy ride today and be able to claim that we are doing brilliantly. It is interesting to hear the strong and consistent message from different speakers today stating that while these statistics tell a tale of economic success, they also tell us a tale of a society that is deeply unhappy with the way the Government is leading the country.</P>
      <P>My wife is currently in the workplace. She is at home with our children. I do not see that work as any different or less valuable &mdash; it is more valuable &mdash; than the work that I am doing here. However, that work is not valued by this Government. The Minister has just stated that we must get people into the workforce, regardless of the future that leaves for the children in our country. The child care policy of the Progressive Democrats certainly could have been written by IBEC, setting the needs of our children in the context of the workforce, rather than <i>vice versa</i>. Such an approach is not only wrong, but in the long run it corrodes and eats into the social capital upon which a successful economy depends.</P>
      <P>The Government should stop the constant mantra that we need people in the workforce to keep the economy growing, as if economic growth in itself was exactly the thing we need. It is clear that such is not the case. I celebrate the arrival of so many immigrants into Ireland in recent years, but I do not want to see it planned on the basis of doing all we can to make sure that economic growth continues.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am not sure that it is clever, although Fianna F&aacute;il would think so, that we are building 70,000 housing units per annum on the basis that it is good for the building industry. We will engage in an incredibly difficult balancing act by keeping this pump-primed economy going. I fear that if we just solely concentrate on pumping economic growth, if at some stage there is a property collapse, we will have a far more dramatic downturn because we have followed this mantra to keep the economy growing at full speed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton referred to the lack of transport, which we have raised for 15 years in the House. It is not just on the west side of the city that this Government has failed, with the Calcutta express running through Clonsilla. I am sure the <Col N="54"/>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, is aware that already, people must also be forced into carriages on the Luas in the mornings because the system cannot cope with the sheer demand for public transport. At the same time, the Government spends four times more on new roads than on public transport. It will postpone the public transport projects again in its updated transport plan.</P>
      <P>The consistent message from the Opposition side of the House is that while our economy has done well and the statistics show massive growth, it is clear the Government is getting other essential aspects of governance fundamentally wrong.</P>
      <P>Clearly the manner in which this wealth is shared out is not working and does not lead to everyone enjoying the prosperity that these figures suggest. It is fine for the Progressive Democrats, who represent the wealthiest 5% of the population. It is fine for Fianna F&aacute;il, who represent the building and developers&rsquo; community, the people who have benefited by far the most. However, while the vast majority of the people welcome the fact that there is not emigration like in the 1980s or the kind of poverty that scarred this country for so long, they are unwilling to pay the price, in terms of imbalances and pressures, to keep the wealthiest people and the building community happy in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate provides a timely opportunity to discuss the Government&rsquo;s abject failure to plan for the needs of the increased and increasing population. I refer to the failure of the Government to prepare for the housing, transport and health care needs of the increased population. Members should stop patting themselves on the back.</P>
      <P>We have over-priced houses and 50,000 families on social housing waiting lists. As other speakers have noted, we have overcrowded hospitals, traffic congestion and jam-packed commuter trains. By April of this year, the population of this State had reached 4.13 million people. Rapid population increases as a result of economic growth have exacerbated problems with shortfalls in the provision of public services such as health, transport, education and housing. It has contributed to deterioration in the quality of life for many in this State. Increased tax revenues from the increased workforce have not been put back into increased services for the increased population. This is a dangerous mistake. As the population continues to grow, services and infrastructure will be stretched to the limit.</P>
      <P>The Government failed to plan for the long-term housing needs of a growing population. The housing stock per population ratio of the Twenty-six Counties was 390 units per 1,000 of population at the end of 2003, compared to an EU 15 average of 440 units per 1,000 of population. Many of the 50,000 families on social housing waiting lists <Col N="55"/>have been waiting for years to be housed. Some, such as single males, find it particularly difficult to secure social housing. The National Economic and Social Council stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">An increase of permanent social housing units owned and managed by local authorities and voluntary and co-operative bodies, in the order of 73,000 in net terms between 2005 and 2012 is necessary to meet the need for social housing.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Nearly a year after the publication of that important report, the Government has yet to make any statement indicating whether it accepts this recommendation. In no other area of policy has a hands-off approach been more evident than with regard to housing. It is bizarre that something so vital to life is so ignored by the Government. What is the Government&rsquo;s housing strategy? How does it intend to address the housing needs of our increasing population?</P>
      <P>Population growth has not been met by a growth in the capacity of the health service. The effects are seen in overcrowding in accident and emergency units, bed shortages and unacceptable waiting times for urgent medical intervention. A total of 3,000 extra beds in public hospitals by 2011 were promised in the national health strategy of 2001. As of this month, only 800 have been provided according to Government figures. Plans for primary care centres across the State have been put on hold.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the treatment received by many migrants who come to this State is the unpalatable truth that lies behind these statistics. While I will not go into the issue in detail, the Government reaction shows no sign that it is committed to cracking down on such exploitation. The pathetic strength of the labour inspectorate alone is testimony to this.</P>
      <P>According to the figures under discussion, the total immigration flow into the State in the 12 months to April 2005 was estimated at 70,000, 38% of whom were nationals of the ten new EU accession states. At the time of their accession, the Government introduced a two year habitual residence requirement before workers could access social assistance. Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the introduction of these restrictions, arguing that the proposals would expose migrant workers to unnecessary hardship. Evidence has now come to light of the hardships experienced by such workers in situations where they unexpectedly become unemployed and where their accommodation was linked to their employment in some cases, they became homeless.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions published a briefing paper on migration policy and the rights of migrant workers, in which it called for the amendment of the habitual residence requirement to specifically allow for the <Col N="56"/>payment of social assistance or benefit to workers on employment permits who are made redundant or who have been unfairly dismissed, including constructive dismissal.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable demand upon which I urge the Government to act without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this debate. As Chief Whip, I have responsibility for the Central Statistics Office and, consequently, am fortunate to be in a position to see the figures as they are compiled. In this case, Members are discussing the quarterly national household survey. While I am disappointed that we have not heard more ideas from the Opposition spokespersons, I make no apologies for making some remarks with regard to the Government&rsquo;s performance.</P>
      <P>The recently published quarterly national household survey provides a most useful and detailed update on how the Irish economy is performing and on how the population is benefiting from ongoing growth and development. I listened with interest to a radio interview with a representative of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, on Monday, concerning the recent report of the IMF into the performance of the economy. He clearly stated on at least two occasions, that the success of the Irish economy was due in large part to sound management of the economy by the Government over the past ten to 15 years.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to reflect on the cornerstones and pillars of what is a new Ireland. Admittedly, it is an Ireland that is at times bewildering in its complexities and challenges. However, to listen to the Opposition in recent months, a stranger would be forgiven for thinking that the country was teetering on collapse and about to re-enter a former dark and gloomy period. It is a truism to suggest that the days of doom and gloom in the recent past in Ireland only come to mind when thinking of the Opposition parties and their sporadic attempts at government.</P>
      <P>When one considers this country&rsquo;s achievements in the past 18 years of almost exclusively Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, one striking policy above all others has worked to ensure continued and sustained success since the late 1980s. It has given birth to a new Ireland and has enabled it to grow, prosper and develop. That policy is one of partnership.</P>
      <P>The policy of partnership, in which all the social partners including businesses, farmers, employers, trade unions, workers and the unemployed collectively agree on our future, has been firmly in place not simply for a couple of years in a single programme, but for several programmes, spanning almost two decades. I am proud to state that Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced this overwhelmingly inclusive policy that has resulted in gains for everyone. This partnership approach has enabled <Col N="57"/>us to manage rapid change successfully and to build popular support for the steps necessary to achieve continued growth and employment. More than ever, Ireland now needs the continued stability that such partnership provides.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.8-?>
      <P>I heard Deputies Eamon Ryan and Howlin discuss the need to view Ireland as a society and not as an economy. I assure them that Members on the Government side of the House view this country as a society. However, I suggest to both Deputies that people living in a society require jobs. We need taxes to pay for the services required in health, education and elsewhere. We are as much concerned about quality of life issues as the Opposition Deputies. I note again that I have heard little in the way of ideas from the Opposition Deputies today.</P>
      <P>This new Ireland is a better place because of the talent, creativity, hard work and enterprise of the Irish people and a Government that works with them. This policy of partnership, solidarity and many other enlightened policies has resulted in Ireland coming of age and it is seen by many developing economies as a model to be emulated.</P>
      <P>Over a period totalling almost 18 years and during our recent concurrent period in office of eight years and running, the enlightened policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and its partners on health, enterprise, investment, taxation, transport, social, sporting and cultural affairs and on the building of community services have brought us to where we are today. It is no accident that a generation of young people has grown up and prospered never having known an elected Fine Gael-Labour coalition. It is a generation since a Fine Gael-Labour coalition was elected to govern this country and it was a period marked by economic darkness and depression, a time of lurching from crisis to crisis and instability. It is no accident that all the gains, the growth, the unfulfilled potential and the dormant ambition that lay untapped has flowered in the intervening period while Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments took the courageous and often painful decisions necessary to turn the country around and went on to build and manage the prosperity of the nation.</P>
      <P>The short-lived so-called rainbow coalition that was in Government from 1994-97 briefly reaped the reward of others&rsquo; hard labour and the claims to the contrary are totally unsustainable and without foundation. The truth is that the foundations had been firmly laid for this rainbow Government by each of the three preceding Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments. What has been built on those solid foundations? Since 1997 alone, more than 450,000 new jobs have been created. A staggering one in every four jobs in Ireland has been created during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>It is accurate to state that in Ireland we have achieved virtually full employment and this year has seen employment pass the 2 million mark for <Col N="58"/>the first time. The scale of the turn around is dramatic and is too easily forgotten. Ireland has an unmatched rate of unemployment, half the European average. We have been in the favourable position of being able to offer employment to nearly 200,000 people who have moved here from overseas to find employment and make their contribution. At 4.2%, our unemployment rate is half the EU average and less than half the rate it was in 1997.</P>
      <P>There are many statistics in the quarterly national household survey that merit closer scrutiny and commentary. The number in employment has grown this year so far by 93,000, which is an additional 93,000 people working and taking home pay. This is the highest annual growth rate recorded since the second quarter of 2000. Therefore, this year witnessed a record growth in the labour force, even greater than the phenomenal growth experienced in the late 1990s. It is important to note that the increases in employment were almost universal, with increases recorded in construction, financial and other business services. In the BMW region, employment is up 5.7% or 26,600 people.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, this Government has halved the national debt and we consequently pay &euro;1 billion less in interest than in 1997. It was this Government that created the National Pension Reserve Fund so that our citizens could look forward to a comfortable retirement in future years.</P>
      <P>There are many areas of dramatic improvement and growth worth mentioning but I will limit myself in the context of this debate to the dramatic leaps made in the arena of education since 1997. The statistics speak for themselves, namely, over 4,500 additional teachers, including 3,000 resource teachers, the lowest class sizes in the history of Irish education, in excess of 30,000 new college places, 6,000 special needs assistants, all Irish schools have access to the Internet and we are on target to deliver broadband to all schools within months. Department of Education and Science funding for research, which stood at zero in 1997, is now over &euro;500 million. This is without mentioning all the improvements, extensions, new buildings, refurbishments and sports halls that have been built within that period.</P>
      <P>Yes, there are challenges and obstacles and, yes, sometimes we do get it wrong but we have a record of achievements that matches our aspirations. We know what needs to be done and have plans and programmes in place to implement our policies.</P>
      <P>Aside from aspiring to office, what plans has the Opposition to speak of? We have heard none today. This country was on its economic knees 18 years ago and violent conflict was the order of the day. Since then, the longest and largest period of sustained economic growth in our history has made us the envy of developing countries and of <Col N="59"/>wealthy countries alike. The peace process is alive and the war is over.</P>
      <P>We are rightly proud of our record of achievements but we do not let it blind us to the challenges that lie ahead, of which there are many. Almost all indicators on the Irish economy in 2005 point to further strong growth in domestic activity. Consumer spending has picked up momentum, investment is also gaining strongly, especially business investment, while housing activity remains buoyant. It now seems likely that housing completions this year will match 2004&rsquo;s record figure of 77,000. Deputy Eamon Ryan asked whether we need these but I will ask him to talk with some of the first-time buyers and young people who need them desperately.</P>
      <P>Tax receipts also rose strongly in the first nine months of 2005, reflecting our robust economic performance. Employment growth, good fiscal policy, generous tax cuts and social welfare increases in the last budget have also contributed to a healthy economy. We in Government are proud of what we have done and achieved in working with others to build the new Ireland. We are well aware of the unfinished business that needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>We have heard absolutely nothing from the Opposition about its vision for the future. We have heard no new ideas or policies or initiatives or how they plan to pay for them. We on this side of the House have a very clear vision for the future of our country, which has been articulated many times by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. I concur wholeheartedly with the Taoiseach when he says he wants Ireland to be: &ldquo;A good country in which to live, to work, to invest, to grow up in and to grow old in, a country that has the potential to enjoy a truly great economy and a truly great society&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Government has worked in partnership with others to realise this vision. I have no doubt that when we all face the electorate in 2007, we will be given a mandate to continue in Government, to build on the unprecedented progress already made and to fulfil the potential of this country and of its people.</P>
      <P>A Labour Party Deputy spoke about the spatial strategy and asked what other cities are developing throughout this country. I remind the House that, apart from Dublin, there are cities such as Galway in my native county, which has become the medical device capital of the west and Europe, Limerick, Waterford, where financial services are thriving, Cork and many others.</P>

	<P>I wish to thank the Minister of State from the bottom of my heart because, in his speech, he stated the last 18 years have been almost exclusively Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments. It is the first time I have heard this because, since the popularity of the Government plummeted in recent years, the one catchphrase I have heard from Ministers is &ldquo;successive Governments&rdquo;. This is the line they pumped as they tried to gloss over their many failings. Something I have difficulty with concerning this Government is that when there are success stories or good news, it is responsible but when there is bad news, someone else is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true. The Deputy is dead right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now clear that we have had 18 years of almost exclusive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments. Therefore, let us get rid of the phrase &ldquo;successive Governments&rdquo;, which can be used very effectively by some of the spokespersons.</P>

	<P>This country was on its economic knees and violent conflict was the order of the day 18 years ago. When history is written, it will show that the Government manifesto of 1977 led to the difficulties in the 1980s. With respect to the conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true. It was prior to 1977.</P>

	<P>It was before the Deputy was born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was before I was born. We are a young party. In 1985, when the then Fine Gael-Labour Government came forward with the Anglo-Irish Agreement, what did the main Opposition party do? Its central spokesperson in the United States of America undermined the agreement. This is how interested Fianna F&aacute;il was in dealing with conflict.</P><Col N="61"/>
      <P>I will speak about the IDA manufacturing jobs, many of which we have lost in recent years. It is regrettable to see various factories closing down but it is an economic fact of life as we become a more prosperous society that manufacturing jobs will decline. A recent statistic indicated approximately 70% of American workers in 1820 were involved in agriculture while there is only 2% today. Who said America is not a wealthy country? The challenge for us is to examine how we approach the our problem of progress in this area. It is time for the IDA to amend its function of trying to attract manufacturing jobs to this country. We must evolve along the value added chain.</P>
      <P>The enterprise strategy group raised the matter of encouraging small to medium enterprises. While a certain amount has been done in this country, it is not enough. Something is given on one hand and taken away on the other. I know it is difficult for the Minister of State to stay today after what he spouted for the past ten minutes. I would have been gone long ago were I in his shoes.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Concerning the charges placed on small businesses, I held a telephone conversation with a man who is trying to buy a site of half an acre in County Wicklow to set up a small business. The local authority&rsquo;s charge is &euro;500,000. On top of this one will be hit by levies and other local charges. The Government likes to take credit for the 40% and 22% tax rates while local authorities and local councillors must take the hit on additional levies because local infrastructure is not funded as it was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Most local authorities are controlled by Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s party and the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, they are. The levy schemes were introduced prior to March 2004 and the previous local elections. The public saw what happened. Members of the public are not as foolish as some Fianna F&aacute;il spin doctors like to think. Many Fianna F&aacute;il councillors were kicked out and Fine Gael has taken control of the councils.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Government had the courage to say that this is its policy and that it will impose local charges. I have not heard anyone coming forward.</P>
      <P>We now have 137,000 migrant workers in the country. Last week I was approached by three young Indian nurses because they had difficulties <Col N="62"/>in establishing their rights and the rights of their spouses and friends to visit. I ask the Department to create a booklet for migrant workers outlining their rights in situations such as where their relations want to visit or they want to visit Britain or the United States. Many immigrants do not have much information. Fine Gael creates an information booklet for the public every year. Some people have tried to take the franchise from us in recent years but we can deal with that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the progress made in the country and the population increase as outlined in the household survey. I suppose Fianna F&aacute;il will take credit for the population increase also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Progress has negative aspects and I want to deal briefly with the problems of progress I encounter. In my constituency I deal with issues on housing and planning, and many towns have remained stagnant. The eastern region has mushroomed and no matter what policy any Government has, one cannot stop that. One can seek to curtail it but it is difficult to get a company to relocate to one corner of the country if it wants to locate in the eastern region. That is an economic fact of life and we must deal with it. We can put certain incentives in place but we cannot prevent a company from establishing itself there. Companies will not be attracted here if they are not permitted to establish where the bulk of the labour force is located and where access to markets and transport is available.</P>
      <P>We must put in place structures to deal with the difficulties that arise. Many towns do not want to experience what happened in Leixlip. Every town should agree to 400 or 500 new private houses and increase its population by a few thousand. However, for some strange reason, people by their nature do not like additional people coming into their area. Many of those towns do not have the internal infrastructure such as a bridge over a river, a streetscape to deal with the growth or it is too costly to introduce the infrastructure required.</P>
      <P>We must examine the concept of creating new small towns as opposed to developing big towns such as Galway or Mullingar as in the national spatial strategy. Instead of these towns getting out of control we should examine the idea of taking the population that must move into an area and creating small towns with populations of between 3,000 and 5,000. I articulated this policy vision for many years but unfortunately it fell on deaf ears. The Government should examine it.</P>
      <P>Wicklow has strange planning processes that people do not understand. A planning policy existed whereby only locals could live in houses sold in towns. With the exception of large towns on the east coast, if new houses were built, only <Col N="63"/>people from Wicklow could live in them. That was a crazy policy and I was opposed to it. It was changed and now if a new development is built, 50% can be bought by Dubs, for want of a better word, and 50% by locals. It is difficult to agree with that policy. If I drive through Germany or France and see a scheme of houses being built in a town and on inquiring to buy I am told I cannot do so because I am from Ireland, I would take umbrage. Central government states that it is Wicklow County Council&rsquo;s decision but it is not. The decision was taken based on the strategic planning guidelines and the interpretation given to the county council by the Department. It is supposed to be applicable to Meath, Wicklow and Kildare. Meath and Kildare did not strictly follow suit but Wicklow did.</P>
      <P>We also have a difficulty with roads. The N11 on the eastern side of the county is a good road and most of it is completed. However, the N81 on the western side of the county is one of the worst and most dangerous roads in the country. The national development plan mentions that it will be upgraded between Blessington and Tallaght. That national development plan finishes next year but nothing has happened with regard to the upgrade of the road. I invite anyone to drive along it. It is treacherous.</P>
      <P>With regard to public transport, a second rail line is required on the east coast. That would mean boring through Bray Head. Perhaps we still have the equipment used in the port tunnel. Running a second line through Wicklow and along the coast must be examined. The DART runs as far as Greystones and should be brought as far as Wicklow Town, which is a primary growth area.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment spoke on education and either he or the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, referred to lower class sizes. The Government made a commitment to have a pupil-teacher ratio of less than 20:1 in classes of children under nine years of age. It is no longer a commitment; perhaps it is an aspiration. The Government did not live up to it. During that period, 30,000 new college places were created.</P>
      <P>Wicklow has sought an outreach for a third level institution because of the hit it took in terms of the increase in population during the past 15 to 20 years. We have not received any co-operation from central government. As recently as last week I received a reply from the Minister stating no plans were in place. However, the local authority and a developer have entered into negotiations with respect to buying the old Claremont college in Rathnew along with 60 acres. They will promote the project in conjunction with the Institute of Technology Carlow. I appreciate any support the Government can give to that.</P><Col N="64"/>
      <P>I regret that the Government sought to use this time to spin propaganda. I thank the almost exclusively Fianna F&aacute;il Government. We will remember that when we face the many difficulties in the month ahead.</P>

	<P>Listening to Deputy Timmins during the past five minutes, I had to pinch myself to see whether I had suddenly been co-opted onto Wicklow County Council. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Listening to the tenor of the debate earlier, someone stated it was a nice idea on behalf of the Government to have this discussion so we could get involved in an exercise of self-congratulation. We should be given credit for the fact that we are far too knowledgeable about the quality of the Opposition in this House to know we would never get away with that.</P>
      <P>I have pleasure in informing the Opposition that the real idea of this discussion was to show how bankrupt of ideas the Opposition is. In that regard I have no hesitation in indulging in an exercise of self-congratulation. If one listened to the last hour of input to this discussion, it is patently evident how devoid the Opposition is of any constructive ideas. I heard somebody state recently that there is much less to the Opposition in the House than meets the eye and it is a good description. I would never claim a monopoly on wisdom on this issue or any other issue, and I speak on behalf of everyone in the Government parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>However, after this discussion I have my doubts. The Opposition&rsquo;s performance has been quite remarkable. We have had entirely subjective opinions given from different angles and it is entirely understandable in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one particular point regarding a radio interview to which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, referred. It is worth repeating. The discussion took place on Monday evening and concerned the recent report of the International Monetary Fund on the performance of the economy. The spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund clearly stated on two occasions that the success of the Irish economy was due in large, not in full, to sound management of the economy by the Government during the past ten to 15 years.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if he has received the business plans from three State airports to date; if not, if he views the immediate completion of such plans as a priority; his views on whether the airports cannot adequately respond to future demands and adapt to changes within the aviation industry in the absence of such plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29709/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In keeping with the provisions of the State Airports Act 2004, the board of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has a statutory mandate to do everything necessary to give effect to the restructuring of the State airports.</P>
        <P>The Shannon and Cork Airport Authorities were incorporated in September last year and in line with the framework provided by the 2004 Act, these two authorities will, in due course and subject to operational and financial readiness, own and operate their respective airports, once sufficient distributable reserves are available to transfer the relevant assets.</P>
        <P>Both the Minister for Finance and I must be satisfied as to the sate of operational and financial readiness of the Shannon and Cork Airport Authorities before the assets of the airports are vested in those bodies. The formulation of comprehensive business plans by the boards will be a key aspect in evaluating operational and financial readiness. The three airport authorities are continuing to work on preparing their business plans, with the DAA co-ordinating the process. In this context, a range of issues needs to be considered, including the unsustainable cost base at Shannon Airport, the recently announced charges determination for Dublin Airport by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the optimum mechanisms for the financing of the new terminal in Cork.</P>
        <P>These are complex issues which the airport authorities must consider carefully and I have not imposed any artificial deadlines on the business planning process. Since the establishment of the new authorities last year, all three airports anticipate record traffic this year, with passenger numbers likely to exceed 18 million and 2.6 million at Dublin and Cork, respectively, while Shannon is expected to reach the 3 million figure for the first time. Even in advance of full auton<Col N="66"/>omy, it is clear that the new boards for Shannon and Cork, in conjunction with the DAA, are bringing a new impetus to developing and growing their airports, with growth this year expected to be over 30% at Shannon and close to 20% at Cork. Both these airports have the potential to build further on this success in the light of what is best for their particular business and their regions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Will he agree that we are now at an absolutely critical juncture as far as aviation is concerned? There is a complete lacuna as regards the restructuring of the various State airports. The Minister says he is not placing a deadline on the business plans. Will not this just allow the type of drift we have at the moment to continue? I am sure the Minister recognises that the Dublin Airport Authority does not know at this time the type of debt it will have to carry forward, either from Cork or Shannon. It does not know whether it will have to carry the debt from the hotels. Already, it has admitted that it cannot build a terminal because the increase in the charges allowed will be less than what it asked for.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister going to look for another bidder to provide the terminal, given that he has picked one that cannot guarantee delivery? Will be insist on business plans being produced by the airports? Is he going to make a decision on the hotels? In short, is he going to make any decision in respect of Dublin Airport, which is at a complete disadvantage now that it faces an open skies policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that there are complex issues surrounding the three State airports. However, we must not lose sight of the important fact that all of the airports are showing record growth at the moment. That is fundamental to their futures, particularly for Cork and Shannon, with Shannon due to reach the 3 million passengers mark for the first time, while Cork will show a throughput of more than 2.6 million this year.</P>
        <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s second last question, it does not necessarily follow that if somebody else is building the terminal, he or she is in a better position. The Commission for Aviation Regulation still determines the charging regime. No private person interested in constructing a terminal at Dublin Airport can do so unless it is profitable. He or she is in it for business reasons and this is significant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is assuming there are no charges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Then there would be no income from it and I do not know whether anybody would actually do that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="67"/>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister assumes that the same cost levels are involved but that cannot be assumed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assure the Deputy that no one has given me any indication that the current rate of charges at Dublin Airport can be sustained. We now have the determination by the Commission for Aviation Regulation. That clearly has implications and is being studied by the board of the Dublin Airport Authority in conjunction with officials from my Department. The process of the airports separating is well under way.</P>
        <P>I cannot make a decision before the proposals are submitted to me for consultation with the Minister for Finance. I am aware of the issues that Dublin Airport Authority is dealing with and it is working extremely well. That should be put on record.</P>
        <P>As regards the new boards in both Cork and Dublin, the three boards share a high degree of confidence that the outcomes will be very good. Importantly, the progress they have made this year on the core issue indicates that they are growing enormously in traffic throughput numbers, which justifies confidence that the projections for the future will be more than sustainable when we are in a position to separate.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am absolutely committed to the separation of the three airports under the State Airports Act. Everyone involved in the process wants to ensure that we get it absolutely right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that Dublin Airport is working well and that the new board is trying to work well but it is faces unbelievable disadvantages. I forgot to mention the fact that the authority now faces the possible re-evaluation of its credit rating, which will further disadvantage it. Will the Minister not accept that aviation in Europe faces a new open skies policy, with airports, airlines and all aviation authorities looking at new routes and new airports? The only country not in a position to do that is Ireland. All our airports are in the position that they literally do not know what the future has in store for them. It appears that no one is making decisions. It is very unfair, particularly for Dublin Airport, which is the national airport, to be disadvantaged in such a way.</P>
        <P>The DAA is not supposed to make policy. It is supposed to be given direction by the Minister, who should govern and decide on an aviation policy. The authority is expected to operate at the moment in a vacuum and this is completely unfair. It is absurd to say that the authority is doing a good job when it cannot make any decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject absolutely what the Deputy has said. Having attended a couple of European Council meetings on transport, with Ireland being <Col N="68"/>very much to the forefront, I can confirm that this is one of the few countries with an absolutely clear view on open skies. That is led by the decision that I made in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that we do not have a clear view on open skies. However, we are not delivering any of the policies that will benefit Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Deputy. In less than 12 months in office, I made a decision on aviation, in conjunction with the Government, that no previous Ministers in 20 years had made. The Deputy might disagree with some of the decisions. That is her right. However, the decisions have been made with absolute clarity on the development of the airports and the structure of Aer Lingus for the future. There is no question about this. These matters are all in play and are being worked on.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is absolutely right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no terminal, no plans, no runway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is why Ireland is best positioned to capture open skies with the transatlantic routes. We do not even have to look just to the transatlantic routes, we should also be looking at the Middle East&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Where will they land? On what runway will they land?</P>
      </Speaker>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>his proposals for management of the estimated 7,000 additional heavy goods vehicles which will be obliged to use the Westlink toll bridge following the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel, in view of the existing serious congestion on the M50 and the long delays at the toll bridge; the policy directions he has given to the National Roads Authority in respect of its most recent negotiations with NTR as provided for under Section 41 of the Roads Act 1993; if he has given direction on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29726/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Traffic management in general is a matter for the appropriate local authority and in the case of the M50, the city centre and the vicinity of Dublin Port, that authority is Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>As a major new element in the capital&rsquo;s road network, the port tunnel will have a considerable beneficial impact on traffic flow in the Dublin area. It will be of particular benefit in facilitating <Col N="69"/>improved access to Dublin Port for heavy goods vehicles while reducing HGV traffic in the city. The National Roads Authority and Dublin City Council are working to ensure that the tunnel, when open, will integrate smoothly with the road network.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the opening to traffic of the Dublin Port tunnel, Dublin City Council will be introducing a heavy goods vehicle traffic management strategy to ensure that maximum traffic benefits are secured from the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s formal role will be to put in place the necessary regulatory framework relating to traffic and parking management and road signage to support the strategy. In addition, the Department will continue to liaise with Dublin City Council as the strategy is finalised, so that I may be assured that the primary objective of the Dublin Port tunnel &mdash; to provide a high quality access route to Dublin Port for heavy goods vehicles &mdash; is achieved in a manner which maximises the overall traffic benefit of the tunnel. The issue of increased traffic on the M50 due to larger volumes of heavy goods vehicles must be considered in the context of the current average of 85,000 vehicles per day on the West Link section. In the first half of this year, between Monday and Friday, average daily traffic was running at 98,000 vehicles. The solution to peak hour congestion on the M50 requires the implementation of the M50 upgrade project and, as part of this, a move to free flow tolling at the West Link bridge.</P>
        <P>In this context, the M50 upgrade motorway scheme and environmental impact statement were published in September 2004 and approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in April 2005. The upgrade involves the widening of approximately 32 km of the motorway from two to three lanes in each direction, from the M50-M1 interchange near Dublin Airport through to the Sandyford interchange, and the upgrade of ten junctions along this length. The NRA envisages that a design and build contract will be awarded by December 2005 for phase 1, the N4-N7 section, and a contract to expand the West Link section operated by National Toll Roads to three-plus-three motorway will be awarded during 2006. The public-private partnership contract for the remainder of the upgrade project is also expected to be awarded during 2006.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The NRA, in the context of the proposed upgrade of the M50, is in negotiation with National Toll Roads regarding the upgrade of the section of the M50 operated by NTR. These negotiations are addressing the upgrading of both the road section and the tolling arrangements. No policy direction has been given to the NRA under section 41 of the Roads Act 1993 in the context of these negotiations. The NRA is, however, well <Col N="70"/>aware of my objective to secure significantly enhanced capacity and an increased level of service on the M50 for road users, including through an early move to barrier free tolling. The NRA will report to me on the outcome of these negotiations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Minister accepts there will be a significant increase in traffic volume on the M50, particularly in the vicinity of the West Link bridge, as a result of the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel. My question asked what proposals the Minister had for managing the imminent increase in traffic volume, particularly of heavy goods vehicles, on the West Link toll bridge. We know traffic in the area is chaotic, with the M50 operating to capacity and daily reports of the problems associated with queuing at the toll bridge. A further 7,000 trucks per day will use the M50 and West Link toll bridge when the port tunnel opens. This is a recipe for chaos and gridlock on the outer fringes of Dublin.</P>
        <P>In answer to my question, the Minister attempted to pass the buck by referring to a variety of agencies. He knows perfectly well that Dublin City Council has no role in respect of the West Link. The council is doing one thing in the city centre, the National Roads Authority something else on the outskirts and National Tolls Roads and Fingal County Council are also involved. It appears nobody is in charge despite the fact that we face chaos when the port tunnel opens next year. Traffic on the M50 is bad enough as it is. What are the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for managing the major problems which will arise in the middle of next year when Dublin Port tunnel opens?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to open road tolling, an issue he has been talking about for a long time. Legislation is required to introduce this system which is urgently needed on the West Link. What is the Minister&rsquo;s target date for introducing open road tolling? A number of proposals have been made to lift the toll gates on an experimental basis to encourage greater use of the road at off-peak times. Has the Department carried out a cost benefit analysis in respect of the possibility of lifting the toll gates or the impact such an initiative would have on traffic flows?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>As the Bill will have little to do with traffic management in Dublin, the Deputy should not to throw it into the hat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very much in the hat. The Government spent &euro;1 billion on building a tunnel for which there is no purpose and no clear plan and, as such, deserves to be criticised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was the originator of the Bill and it has no provisions for traffic management in Dublin. I have tried to impart a great deal of information to the Deputies about the position of the National Roads Authority, National Toll Roads and other bodies but, as usual, the minute <Col N="73"/>I start to answer the question the Deputies start to interrupt me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not be taken in by the Minister&rsquo;s tricks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is using tricks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister raised issues which are not relevant. I asked him a question about the West Link toll bridge which is within the boundaries of Fingal County Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than giving me a chance to answer, the Deputy started to rant the moment I spoke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The factual position is that the West Link toll bridge is in the Fingal County Council area and has nothing to do with Dublin City Council. Given that approximately 7,000 additional heavy goods vehicles will use the West Link toll bridge daily in six months, what, if anything, is the Minister planning to do to manage this development which has the potential to bring the city to a standstill? That was my first question. Second, what is his target date for introducing the long-promised system of open road tolling?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, the two answers are clear. Like the Deputy, I urge Dublin City Council to fulfil its responsibility to put in place a traffic management plan. The Deputy pretends this responsibility lies elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case. The Minister is misleading the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy want an answer to her questions on the toll road and the M50?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I want an honest reply. The Minister should stop misleading the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must proceed to the next question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy does not want answers, there is no point in me attending the House for questions. She came to the House to play a political game on this issue but I will not allow her to get away with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want the Minister&rsquo;s stunts and distractions. He should answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The stunts are taking place on the Opposition side of the House.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>I hope to submit proposals to Government shortly regarding the ten-year transport investment framework. I will publish details of the framework once it has been approved by the Government. Responsibility for entering into contractual commitments for the major public transport projects under the framework will be a matter for the implementing agencies and not directly for my Department. However, the framework will set out the annual global financial profiles and indicative timeframes for the implementation of major projects and the agencies will be expected to work within these parameters. The implementation of the projects will be spread over the ten-year lifetime of the framework, having regard to the state of preparedness of individual projects, their relative priority and the annual financial profiles.</P>
        <P>The forecast increase in population in the greater Dublin area was considered. In developing the framework, my Department asked the Dublin Transportation Office to carry out transportation modelling on the impacts of a number of different scenarios to help assess the optimal mix of investments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from the Minister&rsquo;s response that no major public transport projects will be contractually signed in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il. In the exchange with Deputy Shortall it was interesting to hear he has nothing to do with traffic management in the capital and now he is saying he has nothing to do with the contractual arrangements that these are up to the agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>And nothing to do with the subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that either, and the Deputy should not misquote me. I answered a specific question on who is in charge and gave an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>He is like Manuel, he knows nothing.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="75"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that it would be up to the implementing agencies whether any contracts would be signed. This is the exact replica of what happened four years ago, where Fianna F&aacute;il stated before an election that it would build a metro and six months later when the election was over, it was goodbye to the Metro. Anything he will say about public transport will have the same credibility. It is a Fianna F&aacute;il promise before an election. If the contracts are not signed before the election, sorry, it counts for nothing.</P>
        <P>Are the media reports true with regard to the front-loading in the roads programme, that the Department of Finance after its clever analysis of the transport scene in the past six years when they let through a &euro;6 billion roads programme which cost &euro;16 billion, is fighting the good valiant fight and insisting that we spend more on roads and then eventually, after 2014 or some such date, we will start building public transport? Is that general trend emerging from the Minister&rsquo;s detailed analysis which was meant to be completed last March?</P>
        <P>On the funding envelope that the Minister called the global financial portfolio, if we are adopting a funding mechanism for the proposed metro which would involve, not the State funding it &mdash; Lord forbid we put a penny into public transport &mdash; but rather private finance over 20 or 30 years of the lifetime of the project the Government has proposed, how does that funding fit into the overall funding about which the Minister talks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All the Deputy&rsquo;s assertions, as usual, are wrong. Some day I might figure out what the Greens want. They do not want roads.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Public money into public transport. That is the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will emerge on the investment over the next ten years that will prioritise roads over investment in public transport. That is not the way the plan will be implemented and I am happy to say so in the House this afternoon. I do not know from where the Deputy got that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a huge commitment in investment in public transport in the plan. His assertion that nothing is happening is nonsense. Only last week I signed the railway order for the upgrade of the electrification of the Kildare and Maynooth lines into Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not go to construction for another three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Only last week we completed &euro;175 million investment in the DART, the largest investment ever. Every station is now upgraded to take eight carriages. Passenger numbers per day on the DART are increased by thousands.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is entertainment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to just rant and rave. Investment is taking place as we speak. There has been significant investment, from a paltry sum of barely millions up to 1997&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Four to one in favour of roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to billions. More than the Deputy would ever imagine has been invested in public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree that a longer-term horizon is welcome but the idea of such a horizon is that it gives certainty as to what projects will go ahead. That has not happened. There has been every effort to obfuscate about what is planned to hide the fact that nothing is happening. There have been five year plans. There have been national plans. There have been national envelopes of plans. There are plans which are about to be announced. They will take ten years. We do not know whether it is a nine year plan or an 11 year plan. In other words, projects are being dropped, hidden, delayed, put back in and taken out to the extent that nobody knows exactly what <Col N="77"/>is happening. Would the Minister agree now that we know for certain from all the projections, that the population is increasing even faster than we expected, that there is a real need to start delivering on projects and that the rate of the population increase is far greater than the rate of delivery of public transport projects? There has been a large increase in investment in the DART. There has been an increase in investment in recent years in commuter rail. Despite the fact that Luas has taken 20 million trips off the roads in the year, we still see no net improvement because the population is growing at a much faster rate than that at which the Minister is delivering projects. Similarly, the last section of the motorway has been completed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and yet every day we hear that there are tailbacks on the new section of the motorway, which it is not planned to widen. The reality is we are losing competitiveness every day as a result of congestion in this city and every other city and the public is losing patience with the Minister. As a result of these compelling figures about population, has the plan been expanded, adjusted or accelerated to cater for these increases?</P>
        <P>Is there anybody in the Government who thinks there will ever be a better time for investment in public transport? Will we be richer than at present? Will there be a greater need than at present? In other words, for what on earth is he waiting to get up and going with the public transport projects?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with a number of points the Deputy made. We need to make a huge investment in public transport generally, but specifically in Dublin. I have not changed my view. When I came to conclusions having listened to everybody about what should be in the plan, I would not accept any attempt to alter the plan because it must be a fully integrated plan that will take Dublin into the future.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mitchell is correct. This country is income rich but, as I stated recently, we are not public wealth rich. It is time we created the public wealth, like the investment in public transport and other facilities, throughout this country. I am happy that the discussions I have had with the Minister for Finance have gone exceptionally well. However, never again will I put myself in a position of guessing numbers on projects and finding myself back in this House hearing Deputies state that I said it was X and now it is X plus Z. For that reason, the due diligence that has been done on every single project with every single agency, the analysis, the cost benefit analysis, the real costs, the inflation costs and the pro<Col N="78"/>jected costs all have been put into this programme. They have been scrutinised inside out. We now have almost completed that process and I will be ready to go to the Government shortly with the full investment portfolio. Never before in the history of the State has the roll-out of a project such as the ten year investment for the entire project come, side by side with considerable financial muscle that will stand up to anybody&rsquo;s scrutiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear the Minister has done such a detailed costing. Regardless of whether they are included, could he give me the figure for the cost of the eastern by-pass proposed by IBEC or the interconnector rail tunnel proposed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>This all would be far more credible if we had not heard it week in, week out for the past 12 months. Would the Minister accept, at least, that it is totally false economy to keep postponing projects, that not alone is the cost of each project increasing but the scale of the response is increasing with every passing month?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Ryan, &ldquo;no&rdquo; is the answer. I will not get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the scale of the response that is needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>First, as the Deputy knows, I have instructed the NRA and everybody else to do the complete feasibility study on the eastern by-pass and, therefore, I do not have a costing.</P>

	<P>Significant Exchequer funds have been allocated to Dublin Bus under the National Development Plan &mdash; NDP. Some &euro;349 million in operating subvention has been paid to the company over the period from 1999 to 2005, rising from &euro;16.8 million in 1999 to &euro;64.9 million in the current year. Under the NDP, Dublin Bus has purchased 497 new buses of which 93 are additional and 404 are replacement buses. Some 248 of these buses have been purchased with Exchequer assistance, 179 of which have had their cost met in full by the Exchequer. A further 20 buses will be purchased later this year with Exchequer assistance. In excess of &euro;100 million in Exchequer capital funding has been provided to Dublin Bus since 2000. Included in this is &euro;22 million in Exchequer funds allocated for the construction of a new bus depot at Harristown.</P>
        <P>Significant changes have taken place in Dublin since the start of the national development plan. These changes include substantial increases in rail capacity, such as Luas, commuter rail services and the DART upgrades, together with ongoing demographic changes. As a result of a reconfigured fleet, passenger carrying capacity has increased by 255 at peak times. It is in this context <Col N="80"/>that Dublin Bus is carrying out a review of the bus network in Dublin. The company has advised me that the review will be completed early next year. The company is, in the first instance, assessing how to maximise the utilisation of its existing bus fleet.</P>
        <P>I anticipate that the company will respond to the challenge of meeting customer expectations in Dublin with new and innovative solutions. I intend to carry out full public consultation on the company&rsquo;s proposals. Given the level of investment in the bus market in Dublin, I want a wide range of views on any proposals for further investment in the bus market to ensure that it continues to represent best value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister puts much store in the famous ten-year transport plan for which we have been waiting for the past ten months or so, but I am sure he will forgive us for being utterly sceptical about plans. The public shares our scepticism. The experience with the most recent plan, the national development plan, was that it gave absolute guarantees on funding allocations. That plan provided for an additional 275 buses for Dublin Bus &mdash; an absolute guarantee of funding set in stone as part of the national development plan. However, not one additional bus has been provided to Dublin Bus since 2001. Meanwhile, the demand for public transport is exploding in the city and thousands of people are turned away from buses daily during the morning and evening peak hours.</P>
        <P>Why should we believe anything the Minister says in respect of this famous transport plan when he has not honoured the commitments he gave under the national development plan? Some 275 buses were promised but only 93 were delivered, and that was before 2001. Where are the other 182 buses? When will the Minister deliver them as promised? When will he make some impact on meeting the huge unmet demand for bus services in the Dublin area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether people understand this but, at pain of repeating myself, what seems to be the basis of Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s view and that of others is that Dublin Bus should have got new smaller buses. What Dublin Bus did was to buy buses with a completely different configuration which allowed it to increase capacity carrying in Dublin by over 25%. The replacement buses for which we provided funds are substantially different from many of the buses previously operating in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus, because of the advent of Luas and other facilities, is doing an assessment in Dublin of how to maximise the existing routes. It is Dublin Bus that is doing the full evaluation, not me.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="81"/>

I have asked Dublin Bus to do this evaluation, but I cannot go to Bus&aacute;ras and write it for Dublin Bus. As soon as the company has completed its assessment, we agree terms and it comes to me, I will give Dublin Bus the new buses.</P>
        <P>Unless policy has changed &mdash; Labour Party and Fine Gael Party policy seems to be different every morning when the party leaders come into the House &mdash; value for money must be part of the equation. Dublin Bus must maximise the use of buses</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash; when public transport investment has changed fundamentally in Dublin, but I have asked the company for its assessment to be completed and given to me. Based on that, we will meet the requirements. What the Deputy wants me to do, in advance of any proper assessment, is simply to give Dublin Bus the buses, without any guarantee of value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Not us; the Minister promised the buses in 2000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael and Labour Deputies are speaking in total contradiction of what their party leaders say in the House week after week. When it suits them to sing a different song, they do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is pure spoof. These are the tricks the Minister employs. He muddies the waters, spreads confusion and does not answer the question he has been asked. The Minister <Col N="82"/>promised 275 buses under the national development plan, but he has refused to honour that commitment. He only provided 93 buses and, therefore, owes Dublin Bus and the commuters of Dublin 182 buses.</P>
        <P>Given that the majority of people in the Dublin area are dependent on buses for public transport, notwithstanding the popularity of the Luas and DART, will the Minister explain the reason he refuses to provide the additional buses needed and which he promised to provide? Is it not time we had somebody in the Department of Transport who is prepared to champion the notion of public transport and show some commitment to the people who are turned away from buses on a regular basis because the fleet is inadequate and insufficient to meet the demand? Is it not nonsense to talk about getting people out of their cars when we do not have the required capacity in the bus service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that nobody has championed public transport more than I have. The proof of this will be seen in a few weeks. It is frustrating for me. I would love to have the plan out today or last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is just another promise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister not do what he has already promised? Why will he not provide the buses?</P>

	<P>Several replies to parliamentary questions indicate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>What I have said is that the least we can ask Dublin Bus, or any other company or agency that is in receipt of hundreds of millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money, is to account for how it can maximise and get best value for that money.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>In recent years the DART has been developed and its capacity doubled. We have also had the impact of the Luas. The Deputy is surely not arguing that the existing bus routes should not be touched when the DART and Luas are working. It seems bizarre the Deputy should suggest that. Dublin Bus accepts it has a responsibility to work out the network and has informed me it is in the best position to do that review. I was going to look for somebody else to do it, but Dublin Bus felt it should do it because it knows the network. I agreed and asked it to bring the answer to me.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>the extent to which he has examined the cause or causes of the various fatal traffic accidents that have occurred over the past 12 months; if he will address the issue in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary immediate investigative role with regard to road accidents is vested in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Priority in such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents, including whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.</P>
        <P>Garda reports are forwarded to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary. I have no current plans to propose alternative arrangements for investigating road accidents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I defer to Deputy Olivia Mitchell, but will ask a supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>When I made inquiries recently about the causes of accidents and what investigations are done, I was horrified to discover that depending on the type of accident and whether a criminal prosecution was likely, a certain line of investigation took place, but if there was no criminal prosecution, even in a case where there was a fatality, a different type of investigation took place.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>There does not seem to be any clarity about the causes of accidents. A newspaper has reported today that many accidents may be caused by the use of cocaine and other drugs; that may well be the case. Criminal prosecutions do not result from accidents in many cases if toxicology tests are not done &mdash; I refer in particular to fatal accidents.</P>
        <P>Given that this country&rsquo;s road death figures have exceeded any kind of acceptable level, we need firm information when we are drawing up policy. Everybody can suggest solutions to this problem, but we need to ascertain exactly what causes accidents. Is legislation needed to allow drug testing to take place at roadsides? I appreciate that it can be easier to breathalyse someone than to test someone for drugs. Does the Minister believe that drug testing at roadsides is necessary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a difficult issue. The accidents on our roads throughout October have been appalling. I extend my sympathies to the families of those involved in the tragedies. The answer I gave to Question No. 84 emphasised the primacy of the garda&iacute; but I agree with Deputy Mitchell that the information we need to assemble if we are to make legislative or policy judgments is too thinly spread. The entire body of such information is not available in the cohesive and detailed form we would like.</P>
        <P>When the House discussed the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004, I mentioned that I intend to amend the Bill to provide for the establishment of a new road safety authority, the remit of which will include the gathering of the various details I have mentioned. That single body will be given responsibility for assembling all information.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Mitchell correctly stated, there is increasing evidence that drugs play a part in many of the desperately unfortunate road accidents in this country. I accept that legislation would probably be needed to provide for drug testing but I am not sure how the testing methodology would be worked out. I have had many discussions on this issue within the Department of Transport. I have asked my officials to discuss the matter with their counterparts in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>While we are familiar with the link between alcohol abuse and fatal road accidents, it should be borne in mind that alcohol is not the only cause of the deaths of young people on our roads. It is clear that the abuse of drugs is a major second aspect of the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that he should take the initiative in this regard? It is clear that some accidents are caused by substance abuse and others are caused by road conditions. <Col N="85"/>There is no information about many accidents. The Minister for Transport is in the best position to take the initiative by gathering information, making recommendations to the local authorities and the various other relevant bodies and taking the legislative action that is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Deputy. I conveyed to Deputy Olivia Mitchell that I accept that information on road accidents is somewhat scattered at present. I am addressing the lack of a single fulcrum of information by establishing a road safety authority. I have outlined to the House my approach for dealing with the apparent increase in the use of drugs by young people, who then get involved in road traffic accidents. I will tease out that aspect of the matter with Deputies when the House considers the Bill again. I will be happy to take on board the views of my colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that there are two major gaps in the information that is made available about the circumstances in which road accidents take place? We are not given any information about the status of drivers who are involved in accidents. We do not know whether accidents are more likely to involve unlicensed drivers, for example, or drivers with provisional licences. It is important, given that almost 400,000 people are driving on provisional licences, that such information be made available. It stands to reason that driver status is an important aspect of this matter, especially as so many young people are involved in serious accidents.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a lack of information about the quality of the surfaces of roads on which accidents take place? The Health and Safety Authority does not have a role in examining road accidents. Who is policing local authorities to ensure that they provide adequate signage and set speed limits when road works are ongoing or have recently been finished? It does not seem that anybody is considering whether such factors contribute to accidents or policing the precautions being taken in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Such analysis is being done. Many investigations take place on foot of serious road accidents. I would not like to diminish the strong role of local authorities in that regard, not only under the Department of Transport but also under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to find, after Deputy Shortall raised this matter on a previous occasion, that records are not kept of the qualifications or lack of qualifications of drivers who are involved in road accidents. We need to have such information at our disposal as a matter of urgency because it would indicate clearly rather than notionally the <Col N="86"/>level of driving competence of young people and others involved in accidents. As the information that has been made available is sketchy, one cannot make an absolute assessment on the basis of it.</P>
        <P>This issue needs to be considered in the context of the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004. I look forward to tabling amendments to the Bill and I will be open to any amendments which will be proposed by other Deputies. I do not disagree with Deputy Shortall, who has raised this matter previously, in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that our society&rsquo;s utter dependence on cars, which is demonstrated by the fact that Irish cars travel twice as far as German cars each year, is the fundamental contributory factor behind this country&rsquo;s high level of road fatalities and injuries? It is inevitable that our dependence on car transport, which is much more dangerous than rail transport or bus transport, will lead to a high level of deaths on the road. Therefore, every policy pursued by the Minister for Transport, whose job involves trying to prevent road deaths, should lead to a switch where possible to modes of transport which are safer and which save lives. Is the saving of lives the central plank of the Government&rsquo;s transport policy? If so, does the Minister agree that it behoves us to invest massively in rail and bus transport, rather than encouraging this country&rsquo;s dependence on cars?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ryan has made an extraordinary assertion. I agree that one of the reasons for this country&rsquo;s high level of road fatalities is its extraordinary network of small roads scattered throughout the country. The Government is pursuing a policy of constructing motorways on the major interurban routes to try to improve the road network, but the Green Party is opposing that every step of the way. I have consistently argued that this country needs more roads of a better standard and fewer of the traditional smaller roads. I do not understand, bearing in mind Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s correct assertion that our society depends on road transport, why the Green Party does not support the Government&rsquo;s road construction policy. It is unrealistic to suggest that everybody can be switched from cars to public transport &mdash; that will not happen.</P>
        <P>There were less than 750,000 cars in this country a few years ago, but that figure has increased to 1.6 million today. It is interesting that Ireland&rsquo;s level of car ownership continues to be below the European average. Many important matters can be considered as part of the debate on road accidents, but the most telling statistic that can be used is that driver behaviour is the cause of 86% of accidents. The most fundamental issue to be confronted is the need for Irish people, individually and collectively, to take responsibility for <Col N="87"/>their behaviour on the roads. An improvement in driver behaviour would reduce the current tragic level of deaths and injuries overnight without any need for legislative proposals. I reiterate that 86% of the tragic fatalities and injuries on our roads can be attributed to driver behaviour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying he does not think there is a need for a change in society&rsquo;s attitude to cars?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that a comprehensive body of data is collected when an accident that causes a fatality or serious injury takes place. I have examined the manner in which information is collated by Kildare County Council. Local authorities often respond to accidents by funding low-cost remedial measures or by initiating a major project. There does not seem to be any significant middle ground. Has the Minister considered a different funding response to deal with accident locations which require more than a low-cost remedial response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not disagree with the assertion that we must consider every method, no matter how new, to improve the quality of surfaces, signage and markings on our roads. That is unquestioned. Many accidents occur on what would be termed regional roads and non-national roads, which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. However, testing continues all the time and all the authorities have in recent years examined surfaces and new materials to ensure the standards of road safety can be increased. When we have finished upgrading the road network throughout the country, not just the major inter-urban routes but all the connecting major roads, I have no doubt the situation will improve dramatically. We must remove bad roads with bad bends, which are used by powerful cars being driven too fast, some by drivers who have taken drink or drugs.</P>
        <P>It is a process. We are doing anything we can. We have improved the situation but we need to do more. However, we need the understanding and assistance of the public in terms of individual responsibility to have a big win on this.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if the recruitment process under way for new driver testers will fill all vacancies in the driver testing service; if he will increase the number of driver testers once these vacancies are filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[28820/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The normal complement of driver testers in my Department, excluding the chief <Col N="88"/>tester and supervisors, is 119. Currently there is a number of vacancies in that complement, although by and large these are being covered by the retention of retired driving testers. In normal circumstances I would be satisfied that the normal complement of 119 was adequate to maintain a high level of service to those seeking to do tests. However, as the Deputy is aware, there is an unacceptable delay in providing tests at present and I am progressing a number of options to supplement the testing capability in the short term to eliminate this backlog. This includes recruiting ten further testers on a fixed term contract. The competition for this is under way and is being managed by the Public Appointments Service. This will fill all existing vacancies. I also intend to continue to use the services of retired driver testers in the short term, although this could put the number on the Department&rsquo;s payroll above 119 for a short time. I expect the number to return to approximately 119 once the backlog is cleared.</P>
        <P>In addition, and for the express purpose of eliminating the current backlog and restoring a reasonable level of service to our customers, I am seeking to outsource a limited and defined number of tests to an outside contractor. I have also proposed an incentive package to our existing driver testing staff. If this package is delivered the backlog will be cleared within 18 to 24 months, hopefully within 18 months. My expectation is that by then a cohort of 119 testers should be sufficient to deliver the service and the testing function should have transferred to an independent agency under legislation currently before the House.</P>
        <P>I am not satisfied with the delay that exists in driver testing, from a road safety perspective or in terms of basic customer service standards. As outlined, my plans to address this include a very attractive incentive package for existing driver testing staff, the recruitment of additional contract staff and the limited use of outsourcing. I am looking for the support of all those involved in meeting this challenge. I ask them to agree this extremely generous package and to assist us in looking after our customers in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that driver behaviour is the single biggest cause of most accidents. However, driver behaviour is influenced by official action and particularly by official indifference. The message going out to drivers must be that there is official indifference to road safety given that there are 335,000 drivers with provisional licences, most of whom have failed their driving test. That is the background to the discussion on road accidents.</P>
        <P>Testing is critical. The Minister stated he has advertised for ten additional testers. He also stated that legislation to set up an independent body is imminent and will be back before the <Col N="89"/>House shortly. It is critical that this authority has the budget to provide a sufficient number of testers. I do not want to wander into the area of industrial relations difficulties, and I wonder why these difficulties were not resolved during the benchmarking process and why we are now offering further incentives for increased productivity. Nevertheless, I imagine the background to this is the fact that the testers will probably all be switched to an independent authority, for which the Minister will not be answerable to the House. Therefore, I must ask now whether that authority will have the budget to recruit testers when required to clear backlogs.</P>
        <P>The issue does not only concern backlogs. If the authority has the new road safety remit the Minister promises, driver testers will be responsible for retesting and further activities in regard to ongoing education. In addition, the population is increasing. The budget of the authority is critical in ensuring it can recruit testers when required. The Minister must agree that Ireland is the only country in Europe where road deaths are increasing <i>per capita</i> and where one third of a million people drive on provisional licences. The situation is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is in charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree the situation is unacceptable. The Minister for Finance has been very supportive of me in providing the financial resources to achieve the outcome we need, namely, an end to backlog. I never want to see backlogs recur and it is undoubted that this proposal will end the backlog. When the backlog is out of the way, we will be have the capacity to keep the full complement of driver testers in place. When the new authority is established, resources will be fully available to it to meet demands.</P>
        <P>The existing Civil Service structure is not the right one for the reasons outlined by the Deputy, namely, the system needs flexibility within a public service mandate. This is the best approach. It is a win-win situation for everybody and, above all, it is a win for the young drivers and others who need to get their driving licences. I do not want a position sustained whereby huge numbers of young people are driving on their second, third and fourth provisional licences. That is not the way we should operate the driving licence system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to follow the Minister&rsquo;s logic. There are huge backlogs, with a current waiting time of up to 60 weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In some places.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="90"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This situation has not just occurred overnight but has been the case for several years. Moreover, the backlog does not include all the people who have simply ignored the system and drive without any form of licence. It is an awful situation. The Minister talks about providing incentives to get existing driver testers to work longer hours, recruiting temporary testers and outsourcing the work. If he accepts that all this work needs to be done, how can he believe the complement of 119 testers is adequate? The Minister noted the rate of car ownership is increasing and that people are beginning to drive at a younger age. Surely we need to increase tester numbers in line with the growth in population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that the backlog is so large, at approximately 130,000. I have examined this issue in detail with the testers and have been told by them that they would have no trouble dealing with a normal, average number of applications for driver tests. In fact, it was only two or three years ago that waiting times had reduced to a few weeks. We know what happened then and the reason it happened.</P>

	<P>The logic of what the Minister is saying is completely wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The testers feel that the full complement of 119 is more than adequate to meet demands, although the system has always operated with less than a full complement. However, to give the system the flexibility to bring in extra testers on occasion, or more permanent testers, will make it possible to reduce backlogs. I can only operate on the basis of what I am told by the experts &mdash; the driver testers &mdash; who are at the coal face. They tell me how they operate and what they can cope with. If they deliver and this process delivers, and the backlog is cleared in approximately 18 months, drivers will be able to apply for and get their driving licence in just a few weeks. That is the position that must be sustained into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept there would not be a backlog if the system had worked <Col N="91"/>efficiently with 119 testers? Given that a backlog has arisen, there is obviously a problem. By what date does the Minister expect to have the backlog cleared? How does the Minister propose to appoint those who will do the outsourced work? Will the positions be advertised? Is a firm of consultants required to advise on the issue and all the associated costs?</P>

        <P>I am not in a position of having to go into all this because it has been done. I would be ready to roll it out if we could get agreement on the process. We must go to the Labour Relations Commission. I do not believe that is necessary given the quality of the package in place but if we must go through that process, we will do so. If we get agreement there, we could start the process on 1 January. It will take about 18 months to clear.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>the transition period he envisages for Shannon Airport maintaining its stopover arrangement following the introduction of any open skies agreement between the EU and the US.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29498/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2003, the Transport Council gave the European Commission a mandate to commence open skies negotiations with the USA. It had been hoped that a deal could be reached by June 2004 and Ireland clearly indicated that the current Shannon stop requirement should be phased out over a period of years. As it happened, it was not possible to reach agreement in 2004.</P>
        <P>Following a series of technical discussions, the recent EU Transport Council authorised the Commission to resume formal negotiations with the US authorities with a view to concluding a first stage EU-US open skies agreement by the end of this year. I have strongly supported the resumption of the EU-US negotiations. An EU-US agreement will be good for Irish aviation, tourism and business generally. It will also be good for consumers who can avail of greater access to the US and the lower prices that the increased competition should bring.</P>
        <P>If the talks succeed and if an agreement is ready to be approved by the Transport Council in December this year, it is my clear intention to ensure that it contains an appropriate transitional arrangement for Shannon. The details of the transition arrangement will be a matter for negotiation with the US in the lead-up to the conclusion of the EU-US deal. I do not propose to compromise my negotiating position by giving details of what I might seek at this stage. However, I can confirm that I will seek a transition period of a number of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about speculation. There is speculation that he has already done a deal for a three-year lead-in period. Will that be the lead-in period? Why has the Minister decided to sell out on Shannon? He is going against the EU and the US because they were happy to have an agreement in place. What advantage would it be to Shannon to have an open skies policy? Experience has shown that where there is an open skies policy, the capital city benefits to the tune of 90% to 95%. With 50% of US industry located in Shannon, can the <Col N="93"/>Minister guarantee there will be year round transatlantic services? A transition period of three years has been mentioned in the mid-west but there should be a greater transition period because the infrastructure in the area is not ready. Will the Minister opt for a longer lead-in period?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Deputy is enunciating policy on his own behalf or whether it is Fine Gael policy that Ireland should not take advantage of a huge open skies policy to seek out 22 new destinations in America which would result in considerable tourism business to the benefit of this country. These are routes we would have dreamed about a few years ago but which we cannot access because we have an agreement in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The national carrier is dropping routes, including Orlando.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No deal has been done between me and the US. There was unanimous agreement at EU level about the conclusion of a deal. The Deputy is wrong to suggest we are somehow alone in this. Agreement to close a deal was unanimous between all 25 countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Did that include the UK?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes. The UK is in the chair; it holds the EU Presidency. In fact, I think I am going to the UK to meet the British transport minister next week. I have already had a number of meetings with him at Council level and I have met the European Commissioner on a number of occasions. My officials have gone to the US. Meetings were again held this week. The US is no doubt about Ireland&rsquo;s position. However, the US is not in the mood for messing about. It wants an open skies deal with Europe and is not interested in side bar deals. We will have to work very hard to get a transition deal on Shannon but we have kept communications with the US open and it knows the Government&rsquo;s position in this regard. We want to give Shannon opportunities but the real challenge for Shannon will be Cork Airport. Cork is not prohibited from opening up a range of new transatlantic routes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is moving away from the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is talking about protectionism which is over. Cork could open up a range of transatlantic services to the US tomorrow. It is in no way prohibited from so doing under the deal. People like the Deputy who have a leadership role in their region must look at developing Shannon into the future and should <Col N="94"/>not stick their heads in the sand and cause damage to Shannon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not sticking our heads in the sand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the type of policy the Deputy enunciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is selling out on Shannon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be interested to know if that is Fine Gael policy, which I hope is fundamentally different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he is negotiating a transition deal for Shannon. A transition deal is not only one for Shannon but is one for Ireland. Is it in Ireland&rsquo;s interest in the context of an open skies policy, given that new destinations are being sought by airlines on both sides of the Atlantic, throughout Europe and America? New routes, destinations, airports and countries are being sought. If that consolidation takes place and these new routes are sought out within the transition period, will we not be effectively putting ourselves off the pitch for three years and hugely disadvantaging Ireland? Is the Minister satisfied that will not happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The analysis from Deputy Olivia Mitchell is a very interesting and totally contradicts what her colleague said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister a question. It was not an analysis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree a delicate balance must be struck. I want to ensure Shannon has an opportunity given its new mandate and regime. For the first time in its history, it is doing extremely well with 3 million passengers this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a European issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great compliment to the new board, management, staff and unions in Shannon that it is happening.</P>
        <P>A delicate balance must be struck. Deputy Olivia Mitchell is right about an immediate open skies policy with America and the major benefits which would accrue. However, we are trying to manage a transition for Shannon. I think with an EU-US open skies deal that one will see quick, incremental growth in a short number of years. I want to marry that incremental, natural growth on both sides with the transition. If an open skies policy were to be in place from tomorrow, I do not think one would necessarily see immediate change, rather it would be incremental.</P>
        <P>However, we must position Ireland and Aer Lingus to ensure they have the opportunity to win <Col N="95"/>many of those new routes for the benefit of Shannon, Cork and Dublin. The opportunities are immense. The focus should be on maximising the opportunity of open skies.</P>
        <P>What is forgotten in this debate is that 15 of the 25 EU member states already have open skies with America and are well ahead of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Where do all the flights go?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are one of ten caught in this particular arrangement, which needs to be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and the Government gave us an umbrella when the sun was shining. Now that it has started to rain, they have taken it away. Why has the Minister refused to carry out an impact study on the bilateral agreement for Shannon Airport? Before telling us everything is so rosy in the garden, why will he not have an impact study done on the abolition of the bilateral status of Shannon Airport? It will do much damage to Shannon and the mid-west region. Will the Minister guarantee transatlantic flights to Shannon Airport for 12 months of the year? I do not believe he can. The Government has sold out on the mid-west region. When we had the benefit of the Celtic tiger, the Government did nothing for the west. I am surprised the Minister, coming from the south, supports the Dublin lobby against the rest of Ireland. He can shake his head but it is so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a new accusation. I have been accused of many things but not this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sticking out. Why has the Minister refused the impact study for Shannon Airport? What is he afraid of?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not afraid of anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>So why will he not do the study? What guarantees will he give if he does the study?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am ensuring a future for Shannon Airport. There is no question of this, particularly on the transatlantic routes. The future is to go and get new business. Unfortunately, with all due respect to Deputy James Breen, if one follows the logic of what he and others are saying, they will crucify and kill Shannon Airport, ending its future. They are trying to hold on to some form of protectionism which is over and done with. They must have confidence in Shannon, working with me to get a deal and encourage the airport to get into new American city routes. The opportunities are there to expand into America. Are Deputies telling me that Knock Airport is in a better position to expand into America? The Deputy would want to get into the programme <Col N="96"/>and come into the future. He should stop trying to crucify Shannon on an issue that will finish it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Aer Lingus cannot last. It has already dropped the Orlando route.</P>

	<P>Why has the impact study not been done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday Delta Airlines announced more seats on its US routes to Dublin and Shannon in the summer. Many US carriers have noted their domestic market is slack and are examining transatlantic routes. More US carriers will come into Dublin Airport and Aer Lingus, because it is a small airline, will be gobbled up by them. Orlando has been dropped as a route by Aer Lingus. The international agreement is there to protect Shannon Airport and Aer Lingus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the difference between the Fianna F&aacute;il and the Fine Gael attitude to Government. To me the glass is always half full, to Deputy Pat Breen it is always half empty. The opportunities for Aer Lingus are huge. It has one of the finest chief executives any airline in the world would have been happy to get.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important point. He is charged with expanding Aer Lingus. I am certain the airline will expand into the US. The Deputy was right on his initial assessment. All airlines now realise the profitable routes are long haul.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>They will only be going to capital cities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that future long haul routes for Aer Lingus will be not just to the United States, but to the Middle East, South Africa, the Far East and Australia. If Aer Lingus is to survive and be a larger airline, it must be done. A hub can be created in Dublin Airport to develop a redistribution of long haul passengers into Europe to enhance Aer Lingus and other airlines in that network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>What about a hub for Shannon Airport?</P>

    <Title>Quarterly National Household Survey: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>In my earlier contribution I took issue with some points raised by the Opposition and I will continue in that vein. Deputy Burton referred to a necklace of large towns around west Dublin, naming some of them. I am interested in her sense of direction because one of the towns referred to was Balbriggan. The people of <Col N="98"/>Balbriggan will be interested to know how the Labour Party sees their place in the greater Dublin area. When I left home this morning, they were still 20 miles due north of Dublin. When I go home this evening, please God, they will still be there unless the Labour Party has suddenly decided to shift them.</P>
      <P>One point of Deputy Burton&rsquo;s that I took particular issue with was her reference to an alleged imbalance and deficit in infrastructure in west Dublin. She referred to the coastal area of Dublin as the gold coast, a place where ordinary people do not live as they only live in west Dublin. I take severe exception to that on behalf of my constituents and a large proportion of the people of Dublin. The Dublin North constituency has the same infrastructural difficulties that people in west Dublin have. The only difference is that we have been living with them longer. I reject any innuendo that those of us in north Dublin live in leafy suburbs, having an easy time of it. That is not the case. I invite Deputy Burton to north County Dublin to travel into Dublin city by train early in the morning with commuters. She will find a situation similar to that in her area.</P>
      <P>The increase in employment by 90,000 is by any definition staggering. This is way ahead of the high growth figures of the 1990s. A particularly interesting aspect of it is that the number of female workers increased by 6.2% whereas the number of male workers increased by only<?oasys _jy?>4.2%. For every five people entering the workforce, three are female. That is a notable change, probably an historical shift.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and his predecessor Mr. McCreevy on their handling of the economy since taking office. It is one of the great truisms of Irish politics that Fianna F&aacute;il in Government means a strong economy and that has been borne out by the performance in recent years.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate Deputy Connolly for attending today&rsquo;s debate when the established parties around him appear to believe it is not worth participating in. That reflects badly on them. I have already commented on their lack of constructive contribution to the debate. We never claimed on this side of the House to have a monopoly of wisdom but from some of the contributions this morning we are beginning to doubt ourselves. It appears the main Opposition parties have taken my words to heart and have decided to opt out completely.</P>
      <P>It may be a trivial point but I emphasise the importance of the reduction in the average working week. It is down from 37 to 36.9 hours and I hope that is an indication of a trend to come. I wish to develop this issue and I will do so outside the Chamber as well. It is important to strike a balance between work life and social life within a working week. I have heard much recently about the time commuters spend commuting. It is an <Col N="99"/>unfortunate by-product of the success of our economy and the Government is trying to deal with it. As a Dublin Deputy I would be interested to see figures for the average working week for somebody in the greater Dublin area and compare them to those of somebody in, for example, Deputy Connolly&rsquo;s constituency of Cavan-Monaghan or somewhere on the western seaboard. It would make for interesting reading and I will ask the CSO today for a breakdown.</P>
      <P>At the risk of boring the audience, I am disappointed by the complete absence of Members of the established Opposition parties from the Chamber for this discussion. It is indicative of their bankruptcy of ideas. Their performance this morning in the earlier part of this debate, taken in tandem with their absence now, makes it entirely appropriate that they should be absent for the remainder of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a lonely spot at the moment, but perhaps the fact that I am the only Opposition Deputy here at the moment shows the trust my Opposition colleagues have in me.</P>
      <P>This debate is important. It is important to look at where we are going and to take stock of our changing demographics. In my own constituency there have been changes in the form of new housing, among other things. The population is increasing but not at the same rapid rate as in other areas.</P>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey for the second quarter of 2005 states that our population is growing at the fastest rate in Europe, with an influx of 70,000 immigrants in the past year alone. One of the major changes people have noticed is the number of foreign people they see around. Some 70,000, dispersed throughout the country, is a substantial number and is adding to our population. There was an outflow of 16,600 emigrants, the lowest since records began in 1987. I was surprised we did not have records until then of people leaving and coming into our country. It is important to keep such statistics.</P>
      <P>The natural increase, measuring births minus deaths, was 35,500 for the 12 months to April 2005, more than double the level of 2004. Combining the natural increase and migration with a population increase of 87,000, or 2.2%, gives 4.13 million, the largest population in more than 150 years. This trend has not finished and the population will continue to grow for some time. More than 38% of emigrants were from the ten EU accession countries who joined on 1 May 2004. Of these, 17% were from Poland and 9% from Lithuania.</P>
      <P>The labour force is just over 2,014,000, exceeding 2 million for the first time in the State&rsquo;s history, having grown by 94,500 in the past year. Numbers in employment have also grown, by 90,000, to reach 1.9 million. Construction, finan<Col N="100"/>cial and other business services have shown the strongest growth. Growth has largely been driven by the construction industry. That is normally the case as cranes in the sky are associated with growth and good times. There is a major question mark over whether this can be sustained in the longer term but people have been questioning it for several years. There will always be pessimists who say the bubble is about to burst but it looks like it will continue for another while.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and fishing have continued to register declines, their workforce reducing by over 3,000 while manufacturing employment declined by over 6,000. It is regrettable that these traditional aspects of life are declining and shows that rural life and life in general is changing in Ireland. Crippling increases in energy costs and waste management have contributed in no small way to this state of affairs. Steady economic growth can be maintained only when there is a strong export manufacturing sector and the decline in this area is worrying. Everybody knows that to make real money a country must export its goods. It is a major part of our economy and it is important we continue to take money into the country by this means.</P>
      <P>Migration has been one of the dominant factors in our economic history. It accounts for more than two thirds of this year&rsquo;s demographic increase. In the past 200 years our economic history has been affected by emigration. Emigrants&rsquo; remittances were a major heading in the statement of our national income. We all have some memory of receiving the cheque, the dollars or the pounds that drove our economy in the 1940s and 1950s when there was no money in the country. It was significant and I am not sure those people who pumped that money back got the recognition they deserved. There are people living in various cities throughout the world, particularly in England, in poor conditions. We should do the honourable thing and make it attractive for those people to come back. They lived lonely lives in exile and were important in keeping our economy going. It should now be acknowledged.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The past 15 years have witnessed a marked change in the pattern of Irish emigration and we have experienced positive net immigration since 1991. Initially this was due to large inflows of returning Irish emigrants attracted by improved conditions in the Irish labour market. We can recall that during the 1970s and 1980s, classes of our best-educated people took the boat or plane and left the country. We spent much money putting these people through the education system and essentially educated them for other countries throughout the world. That pattern changed around 1991, which is a good thing, and I hope we never regress to sending the brightest graduates we have out of the country.</P><Col N="101"/>
      <P>Since the late 1990s, however, immigrant inflows have been made up of declining numbers of returning migrants and increasing numbers of foreign-born migrants. A considerable proportion of foreign-born arrivals now consist of immigrants with no prior ties to Ireland. Increasing numbers come from non-English speaking countries. When the Irish went abroad they would form groups and one can see similar dynamics occurring with many foreign nationals in the country. Prior to this transformation of Irish migration, immigration policy did not concern us unduly, with principal attention focused on US treatment of undocumented Irish emigrants since 1968. It appears that Ireland now faces the same challenges as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other EU partners.</P>
      <P>The economic experiences of countries, such as the Celtic tiger economy beginning in the mid-1990s, can shape the size and composition of immigrant inflows. Analysis of past immigrant inflows can tell us much about where migration pressure is likely to be most intense as well as the likely composition of flows over time. The broadening of migration into Ireland will have longer-term implications for demographic trends. While the absolute number of immigrants to Ireland is small, these people are likely to form the beginning of a chain of further potential migrants from their home countries.</P>
      <P>The arrival of the first generation of economic migrants into Ireland is likely to be followed by further migration for the purposes of family reunification. I come across this situation regularly, where people have arrived in Ireland trying to shape their life, set up home and get the basics of our language. Eventually, they will make efforts to get their families to join them. This occurred in the health services when people received work visas to come on their own. Thankfully, the spouses or partners of such people can now accompany them. This pattern suggests that we will continue to have inflows into the country and the population will increase as a result.</P>
      <P>Skills distribution of the immigrant population and overall conditions in the economy are likely to be further affected by migratory trends. It is odd that highly qualified people, such as doctors, teachers and engineers, come to our country but cannot get into the mainstream and are unable to use their qualifications. These people are needed and as our economy is growing, there is a demand for this type of labour. I would like to see the situation change.</P>
      <P>Immigration can add fresh unskilled workers to an aging population but are unlikely to have a major impact on the sustainability of the welfare state. The experience of the trebling of mainly and disproportionately young inflows into Canada over the past 50 years has merely reduced the country&rsquo;s over-65 population by 5%. Immigrants can also fill economic requirements not met by <Col N="102"/>the native labour force, filling occupations in which domestic workers are in short supply. However, in a general sense Ireland has not yet become a major pole of attraction for non-EU migrants.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am glad to acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, whose work I am always happy to admire and who is a great help to all Members. I heard Deputy Glennon lamenting the absence of colleagues on the Opposition benches so I am glad to see and appreciate so many bright and rising stars attending for my speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not forget Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard other colleagues talk about their towns and cities, so I will speak about Tallaght for a few minutes. Like Deputy Glennon, I listened to the earlier contributions and could not figure out if I was living in the same country. I live in Tallaght and represent Dublin South-West, which embraces Tallaght, Brittas, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills. I live in a positive place.</P>
      <P>Up to 15 years ago we often spoke of Tallaght, which now has the third largest population centre in the country, as having the population of a city but the status of a village. That changed on 23 October 1990, 15 years ago next Sunday, when the Square was opened by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. That was a great day and positive occasion for Tallaght. Since then, Tallaght has developed and I invite anybody to take the Luas with me out there any day. Deputy Glennon mentioned Deputy Burton and she is welcome also. Any of my colleagues can visit Tallaght to see how positive a place it is. One can see the council headquarters, Tallaght Hospital and many other facilities that one would expect in a major population centre. One can see how progressive the local institute of technology is and how well the Luas works. If one stands in the Square, as I do most days, one can see 20 cranes nestling in the town centre lands.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for me to come into this House to hear so much negative talk about our country and this city. I do not suggest that people do not have an entitlement to make political points. Ireland has changed and my community has changed. I speak as someone who, like my father and grandfather, emigrated. I took the boat to London and was happy over there. I may not have come back and my history may have been completely differ<Col N="103"/>ent had I not become homesick. When I returned I moved to Tallaght with an employer, became involved in community work and I am now a Deputy. It is good, as Deputy Connolly stated, that this is now possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly also made a fine point regarding Ireland being a country of welcomes. There are concerns surrounding the care of returning emigrants, and I often raise in my D&aacute;il business issues about returning Irish people and the Irish abroad. We should be loyal to these people. However, we must understand how our country is seen abroad. I do not get away as often as most but I have been to Ukraine and China recently. It is amazing to see the image that Dublin and the country as a whole has abroad. People see Ireland now as a leading player and a very rich country. One will hear returning people, be they in Meath, Cork, Monaghan, Clare or north Dublin but especially those who have not been in the country for a while, speak of Ireland in positive terms. I have had much experience of this in Tallaght. They speak of the progress that is afoot.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the need to make political points, we should be brave enough to admit that our country is doing well and that much progress has been made. If one looks at the history of my community in the 15 years since the Square opened, much has been done, and I am proud of the achievement.</P>
      <P>This does bring about challenges. Colleagues made the point about the need to look at ordered development. My community is no different in this regard, and challenges exist there on issues such as infrastructure. We still need new roads. I hope Green Party Deputies will not contend this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>What other Green Party Deputies are here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but we need the further development and extension of the Luas. I am confident that this will happen as the Luas is a tremendous service taking us into the city centre. It now must go through the west Tallaght estates of Fettercairn and Brookfield and out into Saggart and Rathcoole. One will be able, in time, to access Tallaght through public transport in Dublin by getting the DART to Connolly Station and going to Heuston. Even our country cousins will be able to go to Tallaght and Citywest, and it is important that this is stated.</P>
      <P>Community and school facilities also provide a challenge. I am again being parochial. We have great schools in my constituency and there is certainly a need for more schools. We need to look at the major population centres cropping up, such as those in Ballycullen, Westbrook and in the estates of west Tallaght. I hope Ministers listen to <Col N="104"/>this debate, accept the points made and understand the need to develop infrastructure and facilities. I do not suggest that my constituency is unique in that respect, but it has those problems.</P>
      <P>We have a very young population in Tallaght, with about 30,000 people still in school. We need to look at how we will deal with them as they exit the education system looking for jobs. Everyone in the House has his or her own priorities in that regard, but as Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country, I am entitled to make a case for its job creation needs. We need to realise that many well qualified, highly educated young people will come from our communities in the next few years. There is much talk about other parts of the country and I will never criticise that. I have listened to the debate today about Shannon and the west of Ireland. However, there are also challenges in the east and we need to ensure that we cater for those in centres where jobs have been lost. By the way, I am not just talking about my constituent Brian Kerr, even though I am very upset that he has lost his job. I hoped someone would put down an emergency motion to deal with that issue, so that I could speak on it.</P>
      <P>I want to be positive about the survey that is before us. It is good that we have this debate and I hope it is taken seriously across the House. It is important to emphasise what is positive about our country and our communities, while identifying difficulties. I hope the debate about migrant workers is developed responsibly. I contributed to the debate last week and I know the Minister took account of the different points made. It is important to understand the challenge posed by what is now an international community. Some Deputies will have noticed that last Saturday&rsquo;s magazine in <i>The Irish Times</i> highlighted my local school in Springfield, Tallaght, which now has a very large international community. That brings it owns challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I value the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is obvious the Government has allowed this debate to give it an opportunity to talk up its own performance by using figures that reflect well on its policies. In doing so, the Government has opened up the risk of straying into the territory of statistics, damned statistics and lies. The use of statistics as a cold instrument only tells us so much about the nature of the society in which we live. It is undoubtedly true that Ireland is changing significantly and we need to manage that change. However, these statistics do not show the whole picture of the nature of life in Ireland these days. Even taken as measurements of economic success, they are undermined by a fair degree of analysis that shows they are not as effective as the Government claims. The Minister for Finance spoke recently of the 95,000 extra jobs that appeared in the economy in the <Col N="105"/>past year alone. Yet 95,000 people have not yet come within the tax net, indicating that the jobs provided pay around the minimum wage. It is quite likely that many of these jobs are part-time, or are subject to short term contracts and more likely to be filled by women rather than men.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.8-?>
      <P>On a social level, we need better measurements to figure out whether these are useful statistics. The Taoiseach seems to have taken an interest in the notion of social capital and the works of Mr. Robert Putnam. If he is serious about what is contained in such works, there is an onus on him and the Government to present better information to this House and to society as to what exactly is meant by social capital. How is it measured? To what extent is it valuable? Can we use it to find out if we are an improving society? As a member of the Green Party, I feel the statistics should be examined in a more holistic sense to gauge the sustainability of the society in which we live. In recent years, we started to introduce national environmental accounts, but they are examined in isolation by the few who are interested in their relevance and how they might be used to inform public policy.</P>
      <P>What about the physical change in our society? If we took advantage of the Government jet, flew over the country and took an aerial photograph, the mess of our national spatial strategy would be all too apparent. Examples include the overloaded eastern seaboard, the under populated western seaboard and the fact that in the living of their everyday lives, people do not feel better off for being better off. These are failures of the Government and are not, as its members keep suggesting, the consequences of success. It is the failure to plan effectively in the past for which we are now paying a price. We will continue to pay a price for it unless the Government is able to put in place effective measures so that we can enjoy a good quality of life here. I fear that such far-sightedness is lacking in this Government because we are caught up in an electoral cycle where people do not think beyond the next election.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, there are issues on which we should take a consensual approach, such as the social as well as the economic effects of the use of fossil fuels. We should take a ten, 20 or even 50 year approach to such issues, but the Government is not prepared to think in such terms due to its own political needs. Even though we have come to terms with the existence and the use of oil in our society, the social cost being paid by the poor and the elderly is due to a lack of proper planning, which is regrettable.</P>
      <P>Future debates should be more rounded and not have such a self-congratulatory tone. It would be more to the benefit of the House and the people we serve if that was the case.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions. This has been an important debate, not least because population and migration are not issues we consider every day. These CSO figures show Ireland at a turning point. They also give us cause to reflect on how we should build a sustainable future for both citizens and business. I am not convinced that it is useful in this context to distinguish between the concept of society and of economy. In reality, both are intertwined as society benefits from sound and fair economic policies. Some Deputies are concerned about planning for skill shortages. We have recently sanctioned &euro;27 million in funding for F&Aacute;S, for the expansion of training for people in employment. Moreover, the expert group on future skills will assist us with its analysis in planning for the future, particularly in respect of the higher skills area. The population and employment figures give us cause to reflect on the future.</P>
      <P>I want to describe some of our strategies for future prosperity and to outline where I believe the sources of our competitive advantages will lie in future years. Education has always played a vital role in the broad cultural, social and economic life of this country. We no longer simply compete for capital and investment but are now competing for people and knowledge. Governments around the world are wrestling with these challenges where the geography of science and knowledge knows no boundaries. I believe the development of the knowledge economy and the factors that will underpin it to be one of the major challenges and opportunities facing Ireland. The task of making our vision a reality requires investment. The Government will lead that investment and ensure that within the next decade, Ireland becomes an internationally renowned centre for research which generates and uses new knowledge for social progress.</P>
      <P>The transformation revealed by these figures shows we have provided all our citizens with the opportunity to live and work here and emigration is no longer a necessity. Growth and prosperity have provided the country with a new-found confidence, while enterprise has the capacity to invest for the future and the confidence to be less risk averse. The latest 12 month employment figures show that in the year to May, the economy created a further 93,000 jobs. This is the highest annual growth rate in five years, while unemployment is less than half the EU average. Long-term unemployment has been reduced by 70%. Cautious management of success has sustained and will sustain our ability to make sustainable growth achievable.</P>
      <P>The long period of prosperity has helped society. Life chances have consistently improved as growth has opened more varied opportunities for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in many <Col N="107"/>different aspects of the country. Indeed, work continues in this respect. This morning, I had the pleasure of launching a report by the National Economic and Social Forum on allowing access to the workplace to people who hitherto have been disadvantaged. We have recommendations with regard to the forum on the workplace of the future and I am delighted to chair the high level group which will try to ensure we build on the enormous successes achieved over the last ten to 15 years and that in so doing, we manage to include all participants in society.</P>
      <P>Sometimes it is important to pause momentarily to reflect on what one is doing correctly. One hears enough about what one is supposed to be doing wrongly. We can be justly proud of the achievements over the past decade. There is no greater indicator of success than being a sought-after location in which to work and live. The total migration flow to Ireland in the 12 months to April 2005 is estimated to be 70,000, the highest figure on record since migration estimates began in 1987. As a corollary, emigration is at its lowest since then.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The challenge now is one of preparing for the prosperity of the next generation and to manage the transformation of our economy through that process. As always, this demands hard choices, as we must simultaneously seek to further improve the life chances for all our citizens, not simply those in employment. From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, a successful society needs a dynamic economy, which constantly responds to the evolving demands of international competitiveness. We have proved that we can meet this challenge and intend to continue to do so.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, line 29, to delete &ldquo;2004&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2005&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment arises from Committee Stage. The amendment is self-explanatory and proposes to remove the figure &ldquo;2004&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;2005&rdquo;. The Bill was published on 13 July 2004 and on Committee Stage, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, argued that this date was deliberately inserted to prevent the creation of any artificial annuities. I do not believe any artificial <Col N="108"/>annuities have been created and consequently, I ask him to reconsider the decision of his colleague on Committee Stage and accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has reconsidered the amendment. It has been previously stated in the House that 13 July 2004 is the date on which this Bill was published and that it was deliberately inserted in the Bill to ensure that no artificial annuities could be created after the measure was announced to circumvent the Bill&rsquo;s declared intention. Consequently, I oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, line 8, after &ldquo;payment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or instalments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I tabled this amendment because under the proposed legislation as it currently stands, a farmer must make a lump sum payment. In some circumstances, it will be extremely difficult for farmers to do so. I believe a mechanism and facility should be put in place, especially when substantial amounts of money are outstanding, to enable farmers to pay by instalments. They could do so at the end of the year on receipt of their single farm payment. As the Minister of State is aware, the average single farm payment amount is minuscule and most farmers receive &euro;5,000 or less. In some cases, one payment would not be adequate to meet the demands placed on them by the Land Bill.</P>
      <P>Given that the Government has left such a short window of opportunity for farmers to proceed with this mechanism, it is important to encourage as many as possible to buy out their annuities and clear the decks. The cost to the Department of continuing to pursue farmers in respect of this issue by trying to get repayments would be significant. The amount of money involved in annuities is relatively small in the overall context of the Government&rsquo;s budget. I believe the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has called it a fraction of a fraction. Hence, we should try to facilitate as many people as possible to choose this route and the sensible approach is to permit them to pay by instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. Members commented on this issue on Second Stage. In terms of the income that will be generated from this measure, the cost to the Department of collecting it will be fairly significant. Moreover, making an individual pay the amount in its entirety in one lump sum could cause substantial hardship. It is reasonable and fair to ask <Col N="109"/>that it could be paid in instalments. This would take account of people&rsquo;s desire to buy their way out in situations where they were unable to do so in one payment, as they could then make their payments over three or four instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment seeks to spread out the payment of the discounted buy-out figure over a much longer time. The scheme will be available for a defined period and if this amendment was to be accepted, it would enable annuitants to accept the scheme and then defer part of the payment until after the scheme was closed. This would seriously undermine the Bill&rsquo;s intended purpose, namely, a closure on the collection of land purchase annuities, and would in effect bring about a situation where annuitants could prolong the final payment without any sanctions for long periods. The entire concept behind the Bill was to bring closure to the scheme. As it stands, the scheme offers what amounts to a discount of 25% of what is actually owed. In itself, this is a substantial benefit to annuitants and I oppose this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The 25% discount is a substantial benefit to some, but not all, annuitants. Any who have significant arrears must clear them before they can benefit from this scheme, a major flaw. This legislation will not facilitate many of the people who are in financial difficulties and have significant arrears.</P>
      <P>Many who owe substantial arrears to the Department also owe substantial amounts of money to banks. They probably have very poor credit ratings and may not be able to get loans from any financial institutions. In these circumstances, there should be a mechanism whereby, over a limited period of time of perhaps three or four years, they can pay 25% each year from their single farm payments. Such a provision need not be open-ended but it would be a sensible and reasonable approach to try to facilitate these people in clearing the decks and getting them off our books.</P>

	<P>I understand the Minister, following Committee Stage, gave serious consideration to the suggestions made then.

      <P FLI="0">This amendment is self-explanatory. Its purpose is to ensure that before the legislation enters into force, it gets the positive approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as well as the approval of the Minister for Finance.

      <P LI="1">In page 4, lines 16 and 17, to delete &ldquo;in accordance with the provisions of <i>subsection (1)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment allows the Minister for Finance to re-assess the provisions laid down in this legislation before enacting the scheme. It proposes that he will not be tied into the provisions of subsection 1.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because, due to the procedures of the House, I am sadly not allowed to table any substantive amendments to the Bill that would incur a cost on the Exchequer. It is not appropriate that we should have just a 25% discount across the board based on the principal owed. We should at least examine a 25% discount on arrears and the principal to encourage the people who have significant arrears. We are talking about a very small number of people, 98 in total, 49 of whom are in arrears of &euro;1 million or more and 3 who owe &euro;40,000. Every effort possible must be made to encourage these 98 people to avail of this scheme.</P>
      <P>Many of the 49 farmers who are in arrears in excess of &euro;1 million do not have the facilities to avail of this scheme and have bad credit ratings with banks. In the interests of ensuring cost effectiveness from the point of view of the Department of Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s collection of arrears, it makes sense to leave the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s hands open to allow him to provide additional incentives if he so wishes. I am sure that some of the 98 people are in his constituency, as he comes from a rural constituency, and they will get the opportunity to impress on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, the need to be more flexible in this matter. In light of this, I <Col N="111"/>encourage the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The wording and advice of the Parliamentary Counsel is clear and unambiguous and should not be interfered with. The total amount of arrears currently owed to the Department is &euro;5.4 million.

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, line 21, after &ldquo;discharged&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;where such a discharge date is not less than 2 years after the commencement date of the scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is an important, sensible and straightforward amendment that was discussed on Committee Stage. Given that the Minister of State has had an opportunity over the summer to consider it in full, I am sure he will be in a position to accept it.</P>
      <P>I have made my point concerning the arrears. The sole objective behind this legislation must be to address the problems relating to those 98 people and ensure we can facilitate them in availing of the scheme. I have been critical of the fact that there is only a 25% discount and it does not cover arrears. However, it is imperative that we encourage people to take up this scheme as far as <Col N="112"/>possible. For this reason, I have tabled this amendment.</P>
      <P>My understanding, and the Minister provided me with clarity on Committee Stage, is that there will be a six month window of opportunity. This is wholly inadequate. The single farm payment is paid on an annual basis and may not facilitate farmers even if it is significant enough to make the repayment. It is disappointing the Government will leave such a limited window. I know the Minister argued that interest is cancelled on a six monthly basis and it is important that only a six month window of opportunity exists because otherwise each of the individuals concerned must be written to a second time. The cost of a stamp should not be an excuse not to increase the window of opportunity for these farmers. I ask the Minister of State to re-examine this issue.</P>
      <P>Many cases may involve serious legal difficulties regarding land. Even with the lands division in Cavan working on this matter, the substantial backlog has not yet been rectified or resolved. That will delay the purchase of land by individuals. The Department cannot clear the decks within six months because it is not physically possible to clarify the title of many of these properties within that period. Therefore, it is unfair to only allow a six month period for farmers to avail of this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware of the issues relating to the purchase of land from his experience with compulsory purchase orders. I know he will state either publicly in the House or privately to me that selling a site or two would pay the repayments due. A site cannot be disposed of if the case involves significant issues regarding land title. On Committee Stage I gave an example of a farmer who had not availed of the facility prior to the closing date dying within the six month period. I thank the Minister of State for writing a reply to me, in which he stated that nothing exists to impede the executor of the will or the legal representative of the deceased availing of the buy-out offer on behalf of the deceased annuitant within the six month period.</P>
      <P>If anyone in the House is unfortunate enough to need to deal with solicitors with regard to executing wills and going through this process, he or she will find that in many cases it will take far in excess of six months to resolve the issues. Some cases involve substantial inheritance tax issues, and the Minister of State will require the people affected to take out an overdraft, charge the interest against the estate and the inheritance tax that will need to be paid and accumulate a further liability in order to avail of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty if the Minister of State wishes to re-write this section of the Bill to state that people must sign up and express an interest within six months, and then allow a window of opportunity for payments to be made. At least that would facilitate it in some way. The mechan<Col N="113"/>ism in place is extremely prescriptive and will not facilitate a large percentage of farmers who have substantial arrears to organise loans with banks, to generate the revenue to pay off the debt and on top of that pay off the principal of the moneys owed to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment for the same reasons that I supported the amendment on payment by instalments. It will be difficult for a number of farmers, admittedly a small number, to find the revenue to discharge their arrears within the recommended period. It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that they are given that extra time to have a clean sheet so there would not be a build up of arrears and interest. I support the amendment in order to allow people extra time to negotiate a bank loan. Those already in arrears might experience great difficulties in accessing a bank loan within that time, which for someone in that situation might be a short span.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the discounted buy-out scheme is to facilitate the termination of ongoing annuity payments. Annuitants have had a year in which to organise or arrange finance from their financial institutions and check that the title of the land subject to any annuity is in order. The longer the scheme is open, the more adjustments will be required to figures and the half-year gale days go by.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to encourage annuitants to avail of the scheme within a reasonable period of time and bring the ongoing collection of annuities to an end. Accepting the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would lead to serious administrative difficulties and will unnecessarily prolong the administration of the scheme at a significant additional cost to the Department in time and resources. This was widely debated on Committee Stage. The Minister and her officials heard all of the arguments and considered the matter during the summer months. They decided to stay with the original decision. Therefore, we oppose this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister of State is not more positive <Col N="114"/>about this amendment. I am seeking a reasonable period of time in which to facilitate people availing of this scheme. The reason given that this amendment cannot be accepted is because of the administrative difficulties it will create due to the number of gale days met during that period of time. Will the Minister of State put a figure on the administrative costs? I appreciate he cannot do so off the top of his head. I guarantee him it will be a fraction of the cost of trying to collect these arrears in the future from the 98 people involved and other people unable to avail of this discount scheme.</P>
      <P>In the interests of the Exchequer it is of the utmost importance that the Minister of State facilitate as many people as possible availing of this scheme and encourage them to do so. People will not consider this until the legislation has been enacted. The IFA held a campaign and we argued in the House that the discount should be greater than it is. However, until the legislation is enacted people will not examine this issue or the title.</P>
      <P>How many additional staff will the Minister of State appoint in Farnham Street in Cavan to deal with these queries during the coming months? I have dealt with the staff in Farnham Street. They are excellent and all credit must be given to them for expediting cases. However, cases have continued for years because land certificates have been lost, or transferring one piece of land requires the transfer of 40 or 50 other pieces of land in conjunction with it. It will be a nightmare for the staff to deal with this within the window of opportunity provided by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We feel that six months is a reasonable period. The Deputy stated that 97 or 98 cases existed. In fact, 2,300 annuitants with annuities of over &euro;200 per annum are affected and will receive a discount of 25%. The Minister is anxious that closure is brought to this matter and she has already instructed that adequate staff will be available in Cavan to deal quickly with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I will quote the Minister of State on that.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 24 to 29.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a vital amendment. The Department is granting itself extensive powers to confiscate money from farmers without going through the courts. Having debated this issue at length on Committee Stage, it is imperative that the Department reconsiders its decision to retain the provision allowing it to withhold single farm payments in lieu of arrears without recourse to the courts. This power is excessive. On Committee Stage the Minister gave numerous guarantees that the Department would avail of its powers under this section only in extreme circumstances <Col N="116"/>but these have not been written into the legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I do not have a major difficulty with the Department&rsquo;s proposal provided the legislation contains proper protections. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Every Deputy has been asked by farmers in his or her constituency why the House allowed certain legislation to pass in light of a later decision by a Department or Minister to interpret it in a manner completely at odds with the original objective. I cannot allow this section to remain without protections being added.</P>
      <P>From a Government point of view, it makes sense to remove this provision in light of the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in dealing with issues which arise when <Col N="117"/>charges are imposed on people. In court cases, for example, the Minister will not entertain a proposal to issue an attachment of earnings in connection with a court order, yet the Bill provides for attachment of earnings without a case being brought before a court.</P>
      <P>The heavy hand of the Department will put the squeeze on the 98 people who remain in arrears. It is not prepared to incentivise this group of farmers to avail of the scheme or give them a decent window of opportunity in which to do so. Instead, it is using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. Not only will it have the power to offset arrears against payments due from the Department, including the single farm payment, but section 6 gives it the power to confiscate a farmer&rsquo;s dairy cheque. These provisions are excessive and do not contain proper checks and balances. For example, no provision has been made to require the Department to explain a decision before a court.</P>
      <P>The moneys the Department may confiscate do not always originate in the Department but have been committed by the European Union and paid into the Department&rsquo;s bank account, from which it is supposed to be transferred to farmers on condition that they meet compliance rules. The Bill provides for an additional rule that farmers must not only meet the regulations laid down under cross-compliance but must also address any arrears they may have with the Department.</P>
      <P>My concern is that this power will not be used in the manner outlined by the Minister of State on Committee Stage but will be treated as a form of leverage with which to put farmers under considerable pressure. Many of the farmers in question are in severe financial difficulty in that they owe the Department arrears and have large debts with lending institutions. For this reason, they rely on the single farm payment due in December to make repayments. If the Minister retains the provision permitting the Department to withhold single farm payments, many farm families will go hungry this Christmas. I vehemently oppose this provision and asked the Minister on Committee Stage to reconsider it. Sadly, the Minister of State did not table an amendment to ensure that checks and balances are put in place. That is my major objection. I gave the Minister of State the opportunity to reconsider his decision on it and bring forward a balanced amendment, but sadly that did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to get this opportunity. Like Deputy Naughten, I drew attention to this matter on Second Stage. I would go even further. I do not like the power of attachment. I want to make it clear that I am not making a good, bad or indifferent case &mdash; nor is anybody else here &mdash; for persons who owe money to the Department. Everybody understands that in some shape or form this money must be paid. <Col N="118"/>When I was Minister of State in the then Department of Agriculture 20 years ago, we had significant problems with arrears.</P>
      <P>This is a more insidious matter and I will tell the Minister why. If one implements a power of attachment such as this which does not include checks and balances, the Department will deny the farmer his family&rsquo;s income, which now will be the single farm payment together with the area based payments in certain parts, for that year. Where, in fairness to Department of Agriculture and Food, a farmer owed &euro;4,000, for example, the Department &mdash; the officials will bear this out &mdash; has always used a reasonable approach to and deducted &euro;1,000 a year over four years. I have seen this done on many occasions.</P>
      <P>When the Minister of State puts this provision in place the force of law will be behind it. All one will need is a memo from the Department of Finance from people who really do not understand the farming world to ask the Department which is giving a single farm payment of &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000, for example, and to state that the Land Commission in Castlebar or Cavan is owed &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000, for that family farm to receive no income for that year. That is why this is extremely important.</P>
      <P>There is another matter worth mentioning. Once the principle of the power of attachment is used, there is nothing to stop the practice permeating right through the Department on many other issues as the years go by because one has created a precedent. This is the significant aspect of this matter.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputy Naughten was referring to 98 farmers who owe money to the Land Commission on rent annuities. I thought the number was somewhat higher, and possibly for smaller amounts in certain cases.</P>
      <P>While there would be a power of attachment, words as to the effect of how it should be used should be inserted in the Bill. There is no point in the Minister of State stating in the House what he would like to do because &ldquo;like to&rdquo; means nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is for sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It reminds me of assurances of planning permission in five years&rsquo; time. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, then may be the Minister for Finance and somebody else will be in his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He will be the Opposition spokesperson on finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be difficult to pin down the friend of the farmers in five years&rsquo; time when somebody will have a real problem. It is against that background that Deputy Naughten is entirely correct to highlight this. This is a dracon<Col N="119"/>ian measure. It is a heavy-handed measure to deal with a matter, which can be dealt with in a much easier fashion which is much more likely to reap rewards.</P>
      <P>The Department may come across one of those farmers in deep financial trouble. When I was Minister of State at the then Department of Agriculture with responsibility for land for five years farmers were buying land at its most expensive. The value of the land, for which the Land Commission had to pay at the time, was so much higher than the income that one could possibly expect to get off land at the time. It is true that it would have been far better for many farmers if they had never seen Land Commission land at that time but that is not the way it worked out, and the Minister of State knows this better than I do.</P>
      <P>That is the necklace which is hanging over a certain group of farmers, most of whom are in the good farming areas right across the country although this is hard to believe. Some 20 years ago they got into a situation and they found it terribly difficult to get out of it. In my dealings with it, it goes without saying that the Land Commission has been extremely considerate to most of the farmers I know.</P>
      <P>I worry about this legislation for the reasons outlined. Naturally I see the reason this provision is being inserted and why someone would want to do so. It is an instance of overkill. It would be much easier to give many of the farmers who are in significant debt to the Land Commission the opportunity of being able to pay this over a number of years, provided that is mentioned somewhere in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>As one of the signatories to it, I support this amendment. I cannot help admiring the way it is put forward in the Bill, &ldquo;Set off of payments&rdquo;. That is lovely language, but in reality it is attachment to earnings. This is an extremely serious matter. Already, I have had to deal with a few of them which have been dealt with in other areas such as REPS. When somebody becomes ill or whatever, the person can find himself or herself in arrears and suddenly find that all their income is taken from them. I had an aged lady with me the other day with a nice sheet from a Department detailing all that she was owed and another piece of paper where the cheque should have been stating &ldquo;No payment&rdquo;. That is not much good to that man and woman trying to meet their bills. Clearly, that is where we are coming from.</P>
      <P>The power of attachment is a serious matter. There is no sense of what was quoted in the D&aacute;il, that there would be a sympathetic understanding of the matter. It should be subject to negotiations so that X euro debt could be paid over a number of years but the way this is written it is clearly <Col N="120"/>to be taken out of whatever income is available, whether through area aid, REPS, the single payment or even, as Deputy Naughten stated already, going as far as the milk cheque, the mart cheque or whatever.</P>
      <P>This is extraordinarily lethal legislation. I well remember going through the development plan in my county council and getting an absolute assurance from the county manager who stated, &ldquo;Let it go in, we will never implement it&rdquo;. I am in no doubt that the then manager, Mr. Joe Gavin, was a gentleman who stuck to his word until his last day there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A rarity nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;but the new manager announced he had read the plan, was happy with it and would implement it to the letter of the law. As has already been said, I appreciate the understanding of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. He may tell us he is sympathetic but unless this is included in legislation to take account of our real anxieties, examples of which I have seen in operation, it is totally unacceptable. It is also unacceptable that a wife and children, who may have nothing to do with the situation other than living on the farm but who are dependent on that EU payment for their bread and butter, can find themselves without any money because of a law passed in this House. There must be a clear rider included in the Bill if we are to allow this paragraph to remain in it. Such a rider must clarify how negotiations shall take place and how repayments can be made over a period. We have no objections to that because we all accept that the arrears must be paid. However, it is unacceptable that a person would find his total year&rsquo;s income has been taken from him by the State.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State imagine what he would say if this provision came from one of the major banks? They would not even dream of it but would enter into some form of negotiations to get their payments over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>They would have to go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The banks would have to go to court if they wanted to do this. The Minister of State is introducing legislation here that can remove from a farm family every penny it is due under EU and Government regulations. I plead with him to consider how he would feel about this if his family was affected. It is in that light that we should consider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. I share the views already expressed by the previous three speakers. This seems to be a very heavy-handed approach to redeeming arrears. I presume those <Col N="121"/>people who would be in arrears are, perhaps, a vulnerable group. Otherwise, they would have found the way and means to repay the arrears before this heavy-handed instrument would have to come in.</P>
      <P>I see this provision as a dangerous precedent. Those who have spoken referred to attachment of earnings. It is the latter to which this provision, although it may be couched in slightly different language, relates. There is no protection built into the legislation to protect individual farmers from somebody coming and clawing back what could be their entire single farm payment or, as has been pointed out, any other payment. The precedent proposed here is dangerous. There are no safeguards built into it and there is no safety net for the farmer. The provision could mean that a family would be deprived of its household income. A family&rsquo;s full income could be taken from it if this legislation, as proposed, is allowed to stand. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment on the basis set out by my colleagues. The principle of an attachment of earnings is arbitrary because it does not take account of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances. As the previous speaker said, there is no consideration of the particular personal circumstances of the householder or farmer concerned. He or she could well be in serious financial difficulty and he or she might be left penniless, with his or her entire financial support for the year cut off at a critical time.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that this provision, even if written into the legislation, would be constitutional. As far as I can recall, the courts made previously made reference to a company arbitrarily deducting arrears at source, notwithstanding that the moneys were owed. I cannot recall the particular instance but the courts made a decision in this regard. There could be difficulties with regard to the provision and constitutional difficulties with regard to the points raised by my colleagues.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister of State is very nice and that we on this side all love him, we hope he will not be very long on that side of the House because he needs to have a rest on this side. We will do our utmost to ensure that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a nice seat here for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not like somebody from this side of the House to have the onerous responsibility of having to adjudicate on individual cases, which would arise when that happens. It would be unfair for Deputy Naughten or any other Deputy on this side of the House to have to adjudicate in individual cases where hardship might be caused to the people concerned. In <Col N="122"/>those circumstances, the Minister of State should take this amendment on board. He should stitch it into the legislation in such a way that it will have some standing. As I already said, notwithstanding the fact that the provision may be in the legislation, it could well be challenged on constitutional grounds. As that area could be the proverbial minefield, we will not go too far down that road.</P>
      <P>The agricultural sector is not flush with funds and it seems as if it will not be for some time, notwithstanding the efforts of the Minister of State. I believe the proposed amendment would be helpful. It is constructive and would protect Ministers and individuals in the community in a way not provided for in the arbitrary manner in which it is currently proposed to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Naughten ever gets the opportunity to be on this side of the House, I have every faith in his being a compassionate man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of that, but I do not want the extra responsibility placed on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The sell-off powers in section 4 are designed to ensure that farmers who retain their annuities maintain payments thereafter. We have an obligation to the Exchequer and those who have discharged their annuities in the past had to ensure that ongoing financial obligations were met on time. I propose that section 4 remain without alteration.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies mentioned the compassionate nature of people in the Land Commission in Cavan. The measure will only be applied after consultation with the annuitant and in a proportionate and compassionate manner. I do not know of any situation where the Department ever took a full payment from a farmer and I doubt it will happen in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It did so last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department will be compassionate and considerate. If a payment is taken, it will be in proportion to the payments due. However, Deputies should be aware that arrears must be dealt with. The Minister cannot allow arrears to accumulate and at the same time pay State and EU funds where there is a clear breach of contract by the client. The Department intends to encourage the 2,300 annuitants that can avail of this scheme. We hope they will take it up and that the issue of concern to the Deputies will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>As I already pointed out with regard to my previous amendments, the Minister of State knows that the 2,300 annuitants cannot take up the scheme. This is the difficulty.</P><Col N="123"/>
      <P>I have no difficulty in accepting what the Minister of State said, namely, that these measures will only be implemented after consultation and in a compassionate manner. I have no difficulty that the two officials accompanying the Minister of State and other staff in the Land Commission will deal with the issue in a similar manner. I do not doubt that. The difficulty is that people change. Ministers, Ministers of State and officials within Departments change. Officials in the Department of Finance also change. That is what causes my difficulty. The major problem with this section is that no protection is put in place.</P>
      <P>I am not making the case that these arrears should not be paid in full. This must be done. The Department has a relatively good record in many cases of sitting down with farmers and agreeing a repayment scheme but this provision now provides a legislative support for something not currently in place. At present, there is an incentive for the Department to agree a repayment scheme with farmers but it will not need it once these powers are put in place. It can literally force the hand of farmers.</P>
      <P>The other major difficulty I have with the provisions of this section is that they will not be restricted to 2,300 farmers. The section will set a precedent within the Department of Agriculture and Food that will mean that it will not just relate to Land Commission arrears. The provisions of the section will be extended to cover other arrears. Section 4 will make a hungry Christmas for many farm families because it sets an extremely dangerous precedent. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position on this amendment. He should agree to remove sections 4 and 6 from the Bill so that we can proceed with its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="124"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a good relationship, in general. I am familiar with cases which have been sent to outside collectors in the past. The collectors received a certain percentage of the moneys before they were sent to the Land Commission. There is a danger that people who are in real hardship could be the victims of this change. If the needs of such people were considered, not only in the written reports of the House but also in actual legislation, it is possible that we could live with it. This section, as it stands, is intolerable and unacceptable. Fine Gael cannot support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>While I respect the views of the Deputies opposite, I cannot accept this amendment. I ask the Deputies to accept the assurance given by the Minister on Committee Stage and in the Seanad that the issues will be dealt with, if they arise, after consultation and in a compassionate and proportionate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill states clearly that &ldquo;the Department may set off any arrears of payments outstanding in respect of the land purchase annuity&rdquo;. In other words, any payment being made through the Department of Agriculture and Food could be taken. Section 6 expands on this aspect of the matter. It is not a partial payment or an instalment payment that will be taken. Any payment could be taken. A farmer&rsquo;s entire single farm payment, REPS payment or any other payment could be absorbed by the Department to deal with the arrears.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete line 45.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This issue was discussed at length on Committee Stage. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for providing clarification on it in correspondence dated 12 October. He stated that the provision under section 5(2)(<i>e</i>) will only cover leases of greater than 21 years. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, put that clarification on the record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>A lease is a disposal of possession. The issue here is that the Department must ensure that any form of land transaction which is subject to a land purchase annuity, including the leasing of land, would require a certificate indicating that all annuity payments have been paid. I do not want to create a loophole for leases, thereby giving rise to the possible avoidance of annuity arrears being discharged by the leases. As the Deputy stated, the letter outlines the position <Col N="126"/>of the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith. I reiterate that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify that the creation of a lease for a term of less than 21 years does not require to be registered with the Land Registry. Will the Minister of State put that on the record?</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, to delete lines 6 to 12.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The principle of this amendment has already been discussed with amendment No. 6. The Bill provides for the attachment of earnings without having to go through the court system. It is a disappointment that these powers are being provided. As already stated, it is not my intention to encourage people to avoid repayments. I know the Minister of State has put his commitment on the record, as has his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith. However, I am <Col N="127"/>extremely concerned about this provision because checks and balances are not being put in place. It will cause hardship at some stage in the future and it sets a very dangerous precedent. It is unbelievable that the Department of Agriculture and Food should put an attachment of earnings in place, while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not prepared to do so where there is a court decree against a person. I am disappointed that the Government is not prepared to include in the legislation the checks and balances which should be in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. This is extremely disappointing. As Deputy Naughten said, there is a major anomaly in that Fine Gael actually brought forward a number of Bills providing for attachment of fines but we have the ridiculous situation where somebody is sent to Mountjoy Prison because he or she owes some money. It costs &euro;290 per night to keep somebody in Mountjoy Prison, not to mention what it costs to send him or her there. The Government would not rectify that anomaly. Many people would gladly pay their fines, perhaps in the form of &euro;10 per week from their social welfare payments, wages, etc. However, the Minister deemed it unfit to bring in an attachment of fines in such cases.</P>
      <P>In this instance, while it is finely worded, it is an attachment of earnings. The Department is not satisfied with getting the full income a person receives from the rural environmental protection scheme or in the form of a single payment, headage payment or any other payment paid by it or the EU. It is now prepared to extend it to a person&rsquo;s milk cheque or other income. It is extremely disappointing that no understanding or leniency has been shown in this regard.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Naughten, said, the major issue is that a precedent is being set. The former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, told us on several occasions that we would discuss it again in a year&rsquo;s time and so on. However, we now know how little that meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment for the same reasons I supported the previous one relating to a similar set of circumstances whereby there may be attachment of debts. The key point is that a dangerous precedent is being set. Despite any guarantees and assurances that people will be dealt with sympathetically, the legislation will apply if this is challenged. If somebody finds himself or herself in the unfortunate situation whereby there is a demand for payment, the facility is in place to take it from him or her without any consultation or reference to the courts or without a safety net being in place. On that basis, this provision should be removed to preclude such an event from happening.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="128"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The powers set out in section 6 do not place my Department in a better position than any other creditor. It will be necessary for application to be made to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction to obtain the relief provided for in the Bill. I refer here, for example, to the garnishee order provided for in the section. My Department is unable to redirect payments due from third parties who might owe money to an annuitant without first making application to the court. We have put measures in place to ensure that farmers who do not avail of the voluntary scheme maintain their annuity payments thereafter. I could repeat the points I made in regard to amendment No. 6. The measures will only be applied after consultation with the annuitant and in an appropriate and compassionate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The main problem is that it not only applies to payments due from the Department of Agriculture and Food by way of the EU or the State coffers but it can relate to any income a farmer has, whether that from off farm or some other source. A warrant can be issued for the redemption of the sum in question. One does not have the protection of the court because, sadly, this section states that a warrant issued under it is deemed to be a judgment of a court. Once the warrant is issued, it is deemed to be a court judgment without it having to go through the court procedure. That is the main problem with this provision.</P>
      <P>The basic checks and balances are not in place. We are excluding the courts and are relieving the Department of the obligation to negotiate with farmers because it is being given these powers. As Deputy Upton said, this sets a very dangerous precedent. The fact that it is being included in the legislation will mean that the Government will extend it within the Department of Agriculture and Food and perhaps to other Departments to which payments are due.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat hypocritical of the Government to talk about attachment of earnings in regard to arrears due to the Department when elderly people throughout the country are due money from the Department of Health and Children. The Government is not prepared to issue payments to those individuals. At the same time, it is putting legislation in place to enable the Department of Agriculture and Food to withdraw money from farmers&rsquo; bank accounts or to take money due to them from some other source or from the Department. It is an extremely dangerous precedent and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this section.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, his colleagues and the officials involved in the preparation of this Bill. Provision has been made for significant powers which are not appropriate to this legislation. We should have examined providing a more balanced incentive in this regard. We teased out those issues and I thank the officials for the manner in which they responded to them and made the argument as to why they could not concede to them. When the Bill is signed into law, it is imperative that Members encourage many of those 2,300 people involved to take up the offer. I look forward to working with the officials in the Land Commission in securing as many of those full payments of annuities as possible. I thank the officials dealing with this legislation.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with those speakers on the other side of the House in complimenting the Minister of State and his officials. Coming from a farm and a county that depended on the Land Commission, I know many small farmers in County Meath who are grateful for its work. There were also migrants from other parts of the country, particularly from the west, who were always made welcome in County Meath. Some of them became famous and we know the contribution they made to our county, even off <Col N="130"/>the football field. Had it not been for the Land Commission, those people would never have ended up in County Meath.</P>
      <P>Deputies Naughten and Upton supported me on Second and Committee Stages when I proposed that where county councils are acquiring Land Commission land, they should not be able to sell it on in the open market. That land was made available years ago for the poor people of Ireland. I do not want to see big tycoon builders and developers or large farmers acquiring this land. I am confident the Minister of State will consider this in other legislation.</P>

As Deputy Naughten said, it is up to us to encourage farmers to avail of this scheme. I encourage Members to ask farmers to become actively involved in the buy-out on the commencement of the legislation. Any difficulties that may arise will be dealt with in a compassionate manner.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, line 40, to delete &ldquo;8&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;26&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I am proposing that a parent, if he or she so chooses, should be allowed to spend the first year of a child&rsquo;s life with him or her. Expert opinion &mdash; like many Ministers &mdash; supports my view. This amendment is not some madness for the sake of having a run at a Minister or a Department in order to score political points; it is attempting to <Col N="131"/>achieve an arrangement that is better for the child and, in turn, for society. This arrangement of 26 weeks is already in place in the North. I ask that the same principle be applied in the South. All Deputies are only too familiar with the child care crisis. This proposal would be one element in enhancing efforts to deal with that crisis, particularly if people were able to spend time with their children in the first year. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. With maternity benefit, I know more mothers are giving false dates of delivery in order to have access to the entire period of maternity leave after the birth of a child, as opposed to being obliged to take two weeks of it before the child is born. This is a dangerous practice. Nevertheless, with the pressures of work, it happens regularly. This tells us that the amount of time available after the arrival of a child is not sufficient. Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s proposals are more realistic. The Minister of State stated that he is taking the maternity leave model but because of that legislation&rsquo;s attachment to the mother solely, it could be found unconstitutional at a later stage. We are tying ourselves into this model. I believed the adoptive and parental leave Bill was about bringing us into line with the Scandinavian model in how we treat parents and how they develop a relationship with infants.</P>
      <P>It is a good idea to extend the period to 26 weeks. Like Deputy Morgan, I would prefer it to be extended to the first 12 months of a child&rsquo;s life. It is not only experts in the area of child rearing who recognise the benefits of a child being with either parent for the first year of his or her life. Parents themselves recognise it and want to be with their children but, because of the pressures of modern living and the cost of housing, they find it difficult to do so on a voluntary basis. I think the amendment is worthwhile and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay proceedings. We are singing from the same hymn sheet on this side of the House. There is no reason not to extend the period to 26 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputies on the desirability of this move but a process is involved and there is an important link with maternity leave. The maternity working group considered the periods of maternity leave available and made recommendations to increase both maternity leave and additional maternity leave by four weeks each. These increases were immediately implemented in March 2001 and were simultaneously applied to adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave. <Col N="132"/>If the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment was accepted, it would have the effect of breaking the link with the maternity leave provisions and the parity of entitlement between natural and adoptive parents. It would also breach the agreement reached by the social partners on adoptive leave. The review of statutory periods of leave such as adoptive, maternity and parental leave must follow consultation and negotiation involving the Government and the social partners through the partnership process. The views of employers and employees must be taken into consideration. It is not as simple as putting down an amendment or proposal and carrying it in a vacuum. The Government is working on a series of proposals that are the subject of further discussion in the context of social partnership and any budgetary matters will be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Lynch and English for their support for the amendment and for recognising its practicality and common sense. Partnership deals are done outside this House. To expect people in the House who had no direct input into those negotiations, or with the partnerships involved, to accept those deals transforms us from legislators to rubber stampers who do not have the right to amend or even tweak legislation. I do not accept that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy for or against social partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am for people in this House having the right to amend legislation by moving reasonable amendments and for those amendments to be at least considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>On partnership, ICTU agreed the adoptive leave measures. It did not, however, disagree with them being extended, as I am advocating here. I am not sure what IBEC&rsquo;s view is but I do not think ICTU would agree that the legislation should stop there and go no further. I certainly do not accept it.</P>
      <P>This House and the relevant Minister should examine the merits of amendments and accept those that are constructive. I rest my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>We have probably had this discussion three times on this legislation. I do not understand the Minister of State wedding himself to the maternity leave legislation. My understanding of that legislation is that it is single gender legislation. In an age when men, quite rightly, insist on having greater involvement with their children while they are young, I am surprised that the Minister of State refers to a restrictive item of legislation when dealing with a progressive measure such as parental leave or leave for people who are having a child by adoption. He <Col N="133"/>should be proud to introduce such a measure but to do so on the basis of restrictive legislation that everybody knows will have to be revisited because of the equality demands placed on it is incomprehensible.</P>
      <P>The number of politicians who are remembered for doing something in the common good can be counted on one hand and I do not understand why a Minister would not take the opportunity when it presents itself. I ask the Minister of State why he weds himself to legislation that he will be obliged to revisit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do so simply because the bedrock of economic success and industrial peace in this country has been partnership and that was achieved after exhaustive discussions and negotiations around maternity leave, parental leave and adoptive leave. For us to ignore what has happened and what is yet to happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>We all sincerely hope that agreement is reached in the next partnership negotiations to improve the terms around parental leave and adoption and that the Government and Minister for Finance will be in a position to provide the extra resources for that. For us to take a decision without reference to all the other key people concerned would, aside from the fact that budgetary considerations are involved, be highly irresponsible.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that two left-wing Deputies are pushing the idea that we ignore the social partnership process. The unions in this country, through their responsible leadership, have contributed more than anyone else to the success we enjoy today. The partnership negotiations that are about to start are critically important to that continuing. We will hopefully return on another day to approve a new agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not want to become involved in a debate on partnership because I thought we would only deal with the amendment. However, now that the Minister of State has mentioned partnership, it is essential that I do so. I agree <Col N="134"/>with his final comment that the unions and workers have given most in this partnership deal. Consider the Irish Ferries incident and the circumstances involving GAMA. Look beyond that to five Mayo residents in jail until recently over the Corrib gas line scandal. Is this what people signed up for when they subscribed to partnership, and could it be described as such? I am in favour of the concept of social partnership but I will not describe what is currently happening as partnership. There has been industrial peace on one side, as unions and workers have not entered into strike action and they comply with every piece of madness that comes along. On the other side of the coin one can look at the people who would be represented by IBEC, the Irish Ferry sort of company. What is happening there, where workers are to be dumped on their ear to be replaced by &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; workers? Where is the sanction to deal with that issue?</P>
      <P>I am happy to debate social partnership at any stage with the Minister of State, but we should talk of realistic partnership and not the model that is currently there. I do not like the model that exists. Workers and unions have been stripped completely of all their powers to secure fair treatment for their workers. On the other hand, IBEC and employers tread over everybody. The words &ldquo;stand idly by&rdquo; come to mind with regard to the Government, as I can think of another context when those words were used. The Government managed to stand idly by on that occasion also, with much human, social and economic cost. I hope the Government does not stand idly by on this occasion also.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment itself, Ireland compares badly with other EU states on the issue of length of leave and statutory maternity benefit. This amendment would go some way to bringing the country on the radar. I hope the Minister of State will reconsider, although I do not expect he will given his comments so far.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 13, to delete &ldquo;father&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;parent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I do not wish to go back over the whole debate again. All my amendments have had one agenda, which is to grant equal status to both adoptive parents when applying for the right to adoptive leave. I still do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s argu<Col N="136"/>ment that either parent cannot avail of adoptive leave. I was willing to wait until the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 was published, but it was not in that. I will not go over the whole issue again and I will not seek a vote, although I would love to do so all night. I feel it is discriminatory that both parents cannot avail of adoptive leave and cannot choose between either parent. We are not the experts on this, nor is the Minister. The experts are the parents, who should decide which parent avails of adoptive leave. It is a shame that in this day and age, we are not prepared to go that far. The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 does not deal with it, but gives leave for different reasons to all parents for their children up to the age of eight years. Adoptive leave should be additional to parental leave, and it is a pity the Minister of State cannot go some of the way towards addressing this.</P>

	<P>I cannot accept theses amendments, which rely for validity on earlier amendments that were ruled out of order. Deputy English&rsquo;s amendments are consequent on amendment No. 1, which has been ruled out of order. Section 6 of the Bill amends section 10 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995, which makes provision for additional unpaid adoptive leave for bereaved fathers in certain circumstances following the death of the adoptive mother. In the event that both the mother and father were entitled to leave in their own right &mdash; which they are not &mdash; then Deputy English&rsquo;s amendments would have merit. However, the principal Act and this Bill confine adoptive leave to adopting mothers and in this scenario, when the mother dies, the leave can only be available to the surviving parent, namely, the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in repeating the argument. It is disappointing that this cannot be changed. The Minister of State is correct that all the amendments are linked.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete lines 49 and 50.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to an adoptive parent who becomes ill while on leave. On return, such parents are no longer entitled to take the remainder of the adoptive leave due to them. This arises as a result of a lack of understanding, albeit not on the Minister of State&rsquo;s part, and I am surprised to find it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>If a mother becomes sufficiently ill to require hospitalisation or so that she simply cannot take care of her child, she should not be deprived of what she would expect to receive. Under the proposed legislation, it appears that as such a mother came off the disability benefit to which she would be entitled when sick, she could not take the remainder of her adoptive leave. This seems incredible as she would lose out on bonding time with her child. In the first instance, an adoptive mother does not have the same bond with her child as would a natural mother and it must be built on. While this can also happen with women who give birth naturally, clearly there is more bonding to be done when a child is adopted. Under the proposed legislation, however, if, for example, the mother becomes ill for three weeks of the 16 weeks, when she comes off disability benefit, she is unable to take the remainder of the adoptive leave. It is possible that a mother could become ill 13 weeks into the adoptive leave period and it would then not be available to her at the end of her illness. However, it should be. If there is a period of time in which a mother cannot nurture her child because of illness, then she should be able to take the remainder of her adoptive leave as an automatic right when the period in which she is sick ends.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister of State is probably afraid that people will move from adoptive leave to disability benefit and back again in order to extend their period away from work. That fear would have been allayed had the amendment proposing a 26-week leave period been accepted. However, I do not believe that people would act like that. I do not know many women who would do so. Women are put to the pin of their collars in order to return to work, sort out babysitters and all the rest, so as to pay massively inflated mortgages. I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment because it makes sense. Increasingly, I have noticed a trend in legislation which assumes that people will do the wrong thing.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the Bill is to apply the appropriate recommendations of the maternity working group to adoptive leave. I am sorry that I am obliged to repeat that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The agreement unequivocally states that the Adoptive Leave Bill would provide for the termination of additional adoptive leave in the event of illness, subject to the agreement of the employer. As I have stated, the purpose of section 8 is to provide for termination of additional adoptive leave, if the employee chooses and the employer agrees. On its own, the deletion of the proposed new section 11B(4)(<i>b</i>) of the principal Act would not change this but would merely risk introducing a small element of uncertainty. The proposed new section is clearly titled &ldquo;Termination of additional adoptive leave on sickness of adopting parent&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;terminate&rdquo; is used throughout the section. If the Deputy proposes that the balance of leave should be postponed or suspended, then an amendment to this effect would be required. The deletion of the proposed new section 11B(4)(<i>b</i>) would not have the effect of making available the balance of untaken leave to be taken at a later time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I have studied the debate on the Bill and a continuous trend runs through it at all times. The fact that a recommendation was made by the group which advised the Minister of State on the Bill does not necessarily make it right. No one is infallible. We are not the holders of all knowledge, which is what debating is all about. It is surely people&rsquo;s experience when they debate a matter. One cannot continually say that a group did not recommend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This amendment does not do what the Deputy wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It would go some way towards doing it. The Bill states &ldquo;The employee shall cease to be entitled to any leave not by then taken.&rdquo; I want this deleted and the amendment would go some way towards doing so. The provision in the Bill is almost a virtual punishment. Some women who adopt children will become ill and will not take what they naturally would, such as disability benefit, in between the periods as they know they will be short-changed at the end of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>It really is the choice of the individuals. If they want to terminate their adoptive unpaid leave to go on paid sickness benefit, it is a matter for them and there is no problem. This amendment is not necessary in that regard and the deletion of subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) would not have the effect of leaving the balance of untaken leave available at a later time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is correct in that the amendment would not have that effect but if the subsection were deleted, it would clearly be optional then.</P>

	<P>On the buy-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. As matters stand, and we have had this argument before, what is in the Bill will be applied and rightly so. This is what legislation is about. the new subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) The absence from work of the employee owing to sickness after the termination shall be treated in the same way as any other absence from work of the employee owing to sickness, and</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) the employee shall cease to be entitled to any leave not by then taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no argument with the Deputy but if she is proposing that the balance of leave should be postponed or suspended, she must table an amendment to that effect because amendment No. 22 does not deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Any amendment at this stage would be irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I clearly did not initiate this Bill. If the Minister of State agrees with what I am saying, he should amend it to ensure that what I am asking for happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a mechanism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person wants to terminate the unpaid adoptive leave, that person is entitled to sick benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The person might not have that choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that achieving what the Deputy wants in full cannot be done by deleting this subsection unless the Minister of State is prepared to table an amendment but removing it will go half way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. It is compulsory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be written in stone that the leave be terminated in order for it to be open to employers and employees to resolve the issue. Removing this subsection would do no harm. My <Col N="141"/>understanding is that the Bill was intended to bring matters in line with the provisions relating to maternity leave. If one is sick, maternity leave comes into effect after one returns to full health.</P>

	<P>How much time is allocated to each speaker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand it is 30 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Callanan, Grealish and Michael Moynihan. Beef production is extremely valuable to the economy. It has an export value of &euro;1.4 billion, representing approximately 25% of total agri-food exports. Irish beef is a highly competitive product with more than 90% of production exported to the EU and other countries.</P>
      <P>Under the CAP decoupling arrangements for direct payments, for the first time in many decades farmers can focus more clearly on the market-related elements of their income, confident that the single payment will provide an ensured income stream. We will enter this new era from a good base. Our well-developed cattle identification and traceability system, coupled with our highly advanced animal health and welfare veterinary controls ensure we have a safe product from a critical human health perspective.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am also confident that after decades of research and genetic improvements we have breeding stock, technologies and policies from which we can produce the best quality beef. We can do so using modern and efficient farm management practices. This new environment will create a significant incentive for quality production with the producer processor relationship as the key. This will require greater emphasis on cattle prices for farmers being related to quality and integrated supply and purchasing systems, thus satisfying high quality premium market opportunities.</P>
      <P>The future well-being of the beef industry will be directly dependent on the returns farmers can generate from the market. In recent years most of our beef exports have gone to the high value UK and EU markets and that trend continued this year. EU consumption is predicted to outstrip production in 2005, with a resulting import gap of approximately 280,000 tonnes for the year. This will provide opportunities for our beef exports in high value continental EU markets. In the past three or four years, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to broaden and expand its market research at EU retail level, where higher prices are available. This has coincided with reduced dependence on EU support measures such as intervention and export refunds.</P>
      <P>This year&rsquo;s Bord Bia European autumn promotion of identified Irish beef, carried out in conjunction with EU retailers and Irish suppliers, is well under way and is an excellent and sophisticated campaign. Initial feedback is encouraging in terms of improved demand in response to the promotion. It is hoped we can further strengthen the position of Irish beef in the European marketplace as a result.</P><Col N="146"/>
      <P>Despite our success in Europe, non-EU markets will always form part of our outlets for Irish beef, taking certain cuts at particular times of the year, especially during our peak throughput in the autumn. With the assistance of our embassies abroad and Bord Bia, the Government will continue to press hard for the reopening of all of our traditional third country markets. The Russian market has performed well since agreement was reached on the EU veterinary certificate for exports last year. The re-opening of the Algerian market was also announced last October and a steady trade has developed.</P>
      <P>Positive developments have also occurred in the Egyptian market, following intensive efforts over a prolonged period. Department of Agriculture and Food and Bord Bia officials visited Egypt earlier this year and succeeded in reaching agreement with the Egyptian Government in August on a new and much improved veterinary protocol for the export of Irish beef to that destination. Trade will be further underpinned by the retention of a special export refund for Egypt which has been negotiated with the EU Commission. Production has already commenced for one contract and it is expected that trade will gradually increase during the coming months.</P>
      <P>Last week I was honoured to accompany the Minister for Agriculture and Food to meet the Egyptian Foreign Minister. I am confident the negotiations and discussions that took place signify an encouraging outlook for the Egyptian market. I am confident that Ireland&rsquo;s high animal health status and food safety standards will pave the way for increasing access for Irish beef to world markets.</P>

	<P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister for State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, for their stand on the veterinary medicine regulations. It is important that farmers can get medicines for their livestock without too many restrictions and at a competitive rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to state that Irish farmers fully understand the dangers of over-prescribing medicines to their stock. Strict tests are now in place to ensure no residues are present in beef, milk or other products. The Department of Agriculture and Food is aware of the view expressed on the possible impact of the draft regulations on competition of supply of veterinary medicines, particularly regarding the requirements of the EU directive that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescription.</P><Col N="147"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.2-?><P>However, the directive also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level, which will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicine to be exempted from prescription requirement. The EU has not adopted a position on the exemption criteria but must do so by 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements may remain in place. It is Deputy Coughlan&rsquo;s intention to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible. Her Department has made a submission to the Commission with a view to retaining all products that currently enjoy a status of being available without prescription, other than intramammaries.</P>
      <P>The draft regulation published by the Department of Agriculture and Food provides that veterinary medicines, wormers and certain vaccines will continue to be available without prescription for the time being. In practice, this means that apart from intramammaries, the Department is retaining the essence of its existing national prescription and distribution regime. In view of this, it is not necessary for competition reasons to extend the range of persons who may be permitted to prescribe. The Minister will review the regulations, in particular the provisions relating to the categories of persons who would be permitted to prescribe medicines, in light of the exemption criteria that will be agreed at EU level in due course.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is evident the Minister believes her Department is doing everything possible, in so far as it has flexibility to do so, to create an environment to ensure there continues to be competition in the supply of veterinary medicines. Regarding the availability of veterinary practitioners to issue prescriptions, the draft regulations published by the Department of Agriculture and Food will substantially retain the existing regime on off-prescription products until 1 January 2007. This means that with the exemption of intramammary medicines, products available from pharmacies and licensed merchants will continue to be available from these outlets until that date.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities and their location is driven by commercial realities. In so far as Government involvement is concerned, attention should be drawn to the measures of the new Veterinary Practice Act which would help to address any shortage of Irish trained vets. For the first time, the Veterinary Council of Ireland will recognise qualifications from applicants in third countries. This, in tandem with the recent enlargement of the EU, should ensure the availability of practitioners from outside the State to meet any shortfalls.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the decision of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to ban imports of Brazilian beef into Ireland from the regions where foot and mouth disease has occurred. Her decision follows the confirmation <Col N="148"/>of an outbreak of the disease in certain regions of Brazil. The ban is justified totally on grounds of human and animal health. While Irish farmers are rightly forced to accept rigorous standards in the interests of food safety and consumer protection, it is only just that imported products should meet the same criteria. Last year almost 8,000 tonnes of beef was imported into Ireland from Brazil, most of which was used in the catering industry, with no labelling required. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to introduce new beef labelling legislation for the hotel and catering sector. However, I urge her to do so before the ban on Brazilian imports is lifted. This is in the best interests of Irish farmers and consumers alike.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the reopening of the Egyptian trade for beef exports from Ireland. Over the past two weeks, export licences for Egypt amounting to 1,100 tonnes of beef have been taken out by the Department of Agriculture and Food. This once again underlines the international reputation of Irish beef as a quality product.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish the Minister well in her negotiations leading up to the World Trade Organisation talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelGrealishPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Grealish</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue. As a rural Deputy, I have met many farmers and representatives of veterinary medicine companies over the last few weeks. This is an important issue in rural Ireland and I am delighted that this motion has come before the House.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have just a few moments and recognise that many of the important points have already been made, so I will focus on just three. Last night the Minister mentioned the serious misunderstanding of the draft regulations on the part of the Opposition. I listened with a certain amount of disbelief to the contributions from that side of the House which stated that this Government has a blatant disregard for Ireland&rsquo;s food industry and is more interested in attracting transient foreign investment than supporting indigenous employers. That is just plain wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy read the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s implementation plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelGrealishPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Grealish</NameTxt>
	<P>To use this as a starting point for a debate on a serious issue of veterinary medicine practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>He should read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelGrealishPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Grealish</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is unfortunate. It does the parties opposite and their argument no service whatsoever. The unprecedented development of the economy is knowledge based and innovation driven and relies on both indigenous and foreign enterprise. Government policies correctly reflect this.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to the substance of the motion, namely, unimplementable and unwork<Col N="149"/>able restrictions on farmers, bureaucracy, monopoly, and black markets. All of this is based on the assumptions that the directive contains no provision for exemption criteria being adopted at EU level for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from prescription requirements and that the Minister does not intend to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible with a view to retaining off prescription in Ireland all products other than intramammaries. Unfortunately for the Opposition, neither of those assumptions is true.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the clarity of her contribution last night. The Opposition often claims that ministerial statements and answers stray from the point. The Minister could not have been clearer. Ireland intends to avail of the extension clause to the maximum extent possible. The Department of Agriculture and Food has already made a submission to the European Commission with a view to retaining off prescription in Ireland all products currently in that category.</P>
      <P>Under the draft regulations published by the Minister, veterinary medicines such as wormers and certain vaccines will continue to be available off prescription for the time being and in practice, apart from intramammaries, we will be retaining the essence of the existing prescription and distribution system. I am confident that once the exemption is availed of, Opposition claims of unimplementable and unworkable restrictions on farmers, bureaucracy, monopoly and black markets will not materialise.</P>
      <P>My final point is wider in scope. It involves Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union. We are in a period of reflection concerning the European project brought about by the referendum results in France and the Netherlands. The decision of the French and the Dutch to reject the constitutional treaty was a setback but it has provided us with an opportunity. Some benefits may occur from the refocusing of minds on what we, as a people, actually want from the Union. Issues such as that before the House this evening are typical of motions that generate cynicism concerning the EU, the view that Brussels interferes or imposes regulations against our best interest. I urge the Minister and her Department to continue to work in the interests of the country, farmers and indigenous producers and distributors. The Minister&rsquo;s goal is to implement the EU directive while protecting public and animal health, facilitating our food export trade and minimising costs for producers.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment to the motion for these reasons, confident that by availing of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible, we will retain off prescription in Ireland all products which currently enjoy this status. The Minister and the Government deserve support on this exemption, not wild statements from the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion before the House this evening. At the outset, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and Ministers of State, Deputies Browne and Smith, for the excellent work they are doing in the Department and indeed, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, Deputy Johnny Brady, for the work he is doing in steering agriculture.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the few minutes available, I would like to discuss, under the auspices of the motion, the future of the dairy industry at a time of extreme challenges internally and externally. We are all aware of the growing pressures to complete the new WTO trade negotiations in December. The EU is being faced with unacceptable demands from other international partners in the world trade talks, where Europe is expected to make concessions that others appear reluctant to match.</P>
      <P>The Commission is a negotiating body for the purpose of the world trade talks. Its handling of the negotiations so far has not been as self-assured as I would like. Too many concessions have been made which have not been matched by other groups and there is a danger that a deal may not be secured. The risks in such an approach have been pointed out to the Commission and again today in Luxembourg the Minister and her Council colleagues have once more put pressure on the EU.</P>
      <P>Our concerns are reasonable. We face challenges in the dairy sector from both the internal market and external world markets. An agreement at WTO level, however, that fails to recognise the importance of agriculture to the EU will neither command the support of the Union nor enhance the capacity or our dairy industry to develop internationally.</P>
      <P>Developing internationally is crucial for the Irish dairy sector because of the enormous export surpluses we produce in dairy products. We have proven our capacity to stand with the best in doing so and coped with enormous changes. When the Luxembourg agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was settled, we understood clearly that it would form the basis of agricultural policy for the foreseeable future. No further elements of reform would be conceived as part of the world trade negotiations. That remains the Minister&rsquo;s position. Having come through periods of adjustments in internal market supports and export refunds, necessitated by the Luxembourg agreement, the Minister is not prepared to allow Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness to become further eroded by unilateral trade concessions that expose us to unfair and unjust competition while limiting export opportunities.</P>
      <P>We face challenges on the dairy side in the WTO negotiations. We have already faced similar challenges during the past year when the Minister continued to criticise the Commission&rsquo;s handling <Col N="151"/>of the sensitive dairy market management and won support from a number of other concerned member states with which she had bilateral agreements. Decisions taken at EU level were causing severe pressure on the ability of the dairy sector to compete on international markets. The Minister told the Commission that the reductions made on subsidies represent a far too aggressive market management approach and that what the industry needed most was a period of stability. Since then there has been a sustained period of stability that has enabled the industry to continue sales contracts and set raw material prices within a stable, economic and commercial environment. While aids and subsidies at European Union level are essential to competitiveness on world markets, internal competitiveness is the key for Ireland and the area we directly influence. Internal structural difficulties in our domestic dairy sector must be addressed to remove the factors which inhibit growth and development. These matters need to be addressed in a more direct manner at both primary and secondary level in terms of matching product mix with emerging market and consumer demands. At farm level we must consider increasing the scale of operations, reducing costs where possible and providing a profitable future in the sector for the next generation of dairy farmers.</P>
      <P>Although the quota regime has been extended until 2014-15, it is imperative, now more than ever, to assist those who wish to expand their operations within the new environment. The Minister has taken a series of initiatives in this area. In announcing the new milk quota restructuring scheme this year, she deliberately set about framing a two-year restructuring programme providing a fixed price for the purchase and sale of quota. The price will be progressively reduced each year, thus allowing dairy farmers to plan ahead with greater certainty and enable the restructuring programme to operate more efficiently, having regard to the need for more competitive milk production.</P>
      <P>The Minister also changed the regulations to enable the transfer of quota within families without the need to transfer the associated lands. This facility will consolidate dairy enterprises within families and protect the single payment entitlement of family members exiting the dairy sector. It must be welcomed given that the main difficulty in trying to ensure young people enter and remain in the dairy sector is the requirement that a farm is capable of supporting two families. This measure and the rules governing the new entrant-parent milk production partnerships have also been modified to allow large producers to establish such arrangements. This will encourage more young, trained farmers to commit themselves to dairy farming and 350 partnerships are already in place.</P><Col N="152"/>
      <P>In changing the flexi-milk schemes, the Minister set about providing for much more equal distribution of quota between over-quota suppliers in 2005 and 2006. The availability of quota in each co-operative will be allocated according to two categories, namely, those above and those below the 350,000 litre category. Some 90% will be allocated to the over-quota category 1 producers &mdash; those producing fewer than 350,000 litres &mdash; with the balance allocated to category 2 over-quota producers, although the latter will not be allowed to exceed the allocation to category 1. These changes were made to give further recognition to active and committed dairy farmers who manage their production efficiently, having regard to the available quota. Producers who have continually relied on the annual flexi-milk allocation to offset regular patterns of over-production will have to consider other methods, such as restructuring and temporary leasing, and show greater prudence in their production decisions.</P>
      <P>Greater rationalisation is always necessary at processing level. I am not convinced, however, that complete rationalisation is necessary in the dairy sector. A report published in 1989 indicated that Ireland required just three milk processing units. In the years thereafter, co-operatives continued to operate because they were controlled and owned by farmers as shareholders. Figures show that smaller co-operatives which refused to take the rationalisation route paid the best prices to farmers this year. Carberry and Newmarket co-operatives, the two processors which paid the highest prices, have demonstrated that small units can be competitive and cost-efficient. We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater but instead examine all issues before opting for rationalisation.</P>
      <P>I make these points to highlight the strength of the dairy industry and ensure its viability is maintained. It faces an uphill battle on some issues. Nevertheless, the Minister and her team in the Department are looking after the best interests of agriculture. I wish them well.</P>

	<P>T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och as ucht an seans labhairt. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, her Department and the Ministers of State on the vigilant approach they have taken in responding to the outbreak of avian influenza in Europe. I am pleased the Department has appropriate structures in place to deal with the veterinary dimension of the avian influenza threat and is in ongoing liaison with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food has already put in place an early warning system, with the co-operation of the national parks and wildlife service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and BirdWatch Ireland, through which unusual or increased patterns of wild bird mortality is reported. The Department has been <Col N="153"/>engaged in a risk-based approach to the implementation of appropriate measures to minimise the risk of the introduction of avian influenza to Ireland. While endeavouring to reduce the risk of the introduction of the disease, much of the Department&rsquo;s efforts are focused on the early detection and speedy eradication of the disease.</P>
      <P>A European Commission decision adopted in Brussels last Friday provides for the introduction of additional biosecurity measures and early detection systems. Each member state is required to implement the measures provided for on the basis of a risk assessment, taking full account of the criteria and risk factors set out in the annexes to the decision. Following the decision adopted on Friday last, officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food met the other stakeholders to review the provisions of the decision and the effective operation of the existing early warning system. A further key element in early detection is testing carried out under the annual avian influenza survey plan, as provided for by Commission Decision 2005/464/EC.</P>
      <P>The testing of samples is undertaken by the central veterinary research laboratory in Abbotstown. A serological monitoring programme has been in place since 1995 as part of the poultry health programme which monitors commercial breeding poultry, that is, chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, just before they come into lay and when they move sites. In addition, blood samples from clinically sick poultry are screened, as are commercial layer flocks before export. Some 20,000 samples are screened for all sub-types annually. A more extensive survey, including other categories of poultry and wild birds, has been carried out as part of an EU survey since 2002. It is expected that, as part of this year&rsquo;s survey, samples will again be taken from birds in wildlife sanctuaries of international interest as well as game clubs. During last year&rsquo;s survey, 350 samples were analysed and it is anticipated that this figure will be exceeded this year.</P>
      <P>Surveillance is central to early detection and the outcome of the surveillance of wild birds should provide further valuable information for an early warning system of strains that may be introduced to poultry from wild birds. In addition to the early warning arrangements, the Department of Agriculture and Food has also updated and re-issued advice and information on biosecurity measures to be taken by poultry flock owners and measures which could be taken to minimise the risk of introducing the disease. The Department has also published details of the clinical symptoms of avian influenza to watch out for and has issued advice to those travelling to and from affected areas.</P>
      <P>The Department continually reassesses the level of risk in light of any emerging information, taking account of the most up-to-date veterinary and scientific advice available. It will continue to <Col N="154"/>operate a risk based approach and maintain a measured response to the risk. In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, a range of measures will be put in place to ensure the early eradication of the disease, including the slaughtering of birds and declaration of a 3 km protection zone and a 10 km surveillance zone around the infected premises. Movements of poultry, poultry transport, carcasses, eggs and other articles likely to transmit the virus will be controlled by licence. The infected premises will be subject to cleaning and disinfecting under official supervision of the Department. On the basis of my discussions with officials from the Department, I am satisfied that all appropriate measures have been taken by the Minister to reduce risk. I am also convinced that she will introduce additional measures, as appropriate, to reduce any risk.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provisions on intramammaries in the veterinary medicines legislation, I am aware from discussions with the Minister that she is fully cognisant of the devastation farmers would suffer if proposals issued by the European Union are adopted. I am quite confident the Minister is well aware of the needs of the producer. Through our committee work we met the pharmacists, the veterinary organisations and the farmers. I have not been shy in mentioning that the producer, that is the farmer, is the most important person in this debate.</P>
      <P>Apart from Luxembourg, Ireland is the only member state of the EU 15 countries where intramammaries containing antibiotics are not subject to veterinary prescription. In the report issued in 1999 the IMB proposed that intramammaries be brought under veterinary prescription to take account of the generally accepted necessity to address concerns about the levels and growth of antibiotic resistance in the human population.</P>
      <P>I am confident the Minister will address fully the needs of the farming community and that she will bring about a workable system within the EU directive that is before her. Certainly she is not short on knowledge from the backbenchers here, my colleagues, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, Deputy Johnny Brady, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne and the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, who have also been in discussions with the Minister on this matter and on the parameters within the EU directive in which the flexibility can be given so that farmers may continue to dose their animals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Connolly and James Breen.</P>
      <P>We come across bizarre and ridiculous legislation and this is certainly in that category. In law, a pharmacist can dispense an anti-worm or an anthelmintic for a child without a prescription but under the law he will not be able to give the same drug for an animal. Animals are full of worms. Therefore farmers will look for these medicines constantly. They will have to find a veterinary practitioner to get a prescription and then pay the vet. In this regard, every farmer will be robbed. The best lambs are worth approximately &euro;30 to &euro;40 and a prescription from a veterinary practitioner, if one can be found, will cost the same amount. What are farmers likely to do in such cases? The animal concerned will not be treated and disease will abound.</P>
      <P>One would need a helicopter to find a veterinary practitioner in County Mayo, the third largest county in Ireland. How will farmers get to the veterinary practitioner to get this prescription? It is utter madness. People will not treat their animals and fluke and worms will thrive if the farmers must go through this punishment to get a prescription. Fluke kills animals and can cause infestation in humans. There will be great spread of disease.</P>
      <P>Veterinary practitioners will have the market to themselves, will charge what they like and will dispense the medicines. My local chemist has told me he has received only one or two prescriptions from veterinary practitioners in 17 years.</P>
      <P>Already antibiotics are controlled. What is the point of all of this? This appears to be the Hanly plan for animals. The Government will dismantle the infrastructure. It will take out a tier of a system used by farmers to treat animals and drive people into the big centres of populations such as Castlebar, Ballina, Westport. How many farmers will be left after that? We know what the Hanly plan did for humans. This plan will wipe out farmers.</P>
      <P>Another example is spot-on, a pour-on for lice in cattle and animals. Chemists cannot sell it for use on dogs or cats, but one can use it to pour on cattle and sheep. The rationale behind this is that it might enter the food chain but unless one lives in a dog-eating or cat-eating jurisdiction, this is ridiculous because it does not affect the food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The draft animal remedies regulations will have a major restrictive effect on the availability of farm medicines and will adversely affect farmers&rsquo; competitiveness in the market. Irish farmers merely wish to be in a position to produce food to the highest standards, without necessarily being restricted or discriminated against. In its current form the proposed legislation can only be described as a retrograde step, failing to recognise the positive aspects of the cur<Col N="156"/>rent system. This is particularly so in the case of the mastitis control programmes. Under the terms of the directive there is nothing to prevent Ireland from continuing with this system.</P>
      <P>Farmers and animal owners should be encouraged to adopt a preventive approach with medicines, to ensure the highest standards of animal health. Generally tighter controls should be instrumental in ensuring that Irish food will remain residue free by the observance of the withdrawal period for the medicines administered. This is a key link in the food chain. However, if veterinary practitioners are unavailable there is always the possibility that this new legislation may result in a decline in the use of medicines to prevent disease. This would be most detrimental to the best interests of farmers, food producers and consumers.</P>
      <P>These regulations fail to recognise the ability, experience and professionalism of Irish farmers as keepers of livestock and are a cause of major concern to them. There also is the crazy situation where the flow of legitimate technical information to livestock farmers through advertisements in farming journals would be prevented. They are anti-competitive in the sense that the introduction of a veterinary prescription requirement for all animal medicines will reduce competition in their sale, to the obvious disadvantage of other suppliers. The viability of the network of supply outlets in co-operative stores and other outlets will be seriously undermined.</P>
      <P>Prescription only medicines for animals are considerably more expensive than non-prescription medicines. There is the ludicrous case of head lice treatment, to which Deputy Cowley referred, which one may purchase over the counter for a child but not for an animal. This must be looked at. It is not sensible. There is a major cost implication in this for the farmer and it will be passed on to the consumer. In some instances it will not be worthwhile spending the money concerned on an animal such as a lamb or a small pig and the possibility is that the animal will be put down.</P>
      <P>The prescription may not permit any choice of generic products which will undoubtedly add to the cost of available remedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent publication by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the draft animal remedies regulations 2005 is both unfair to farmers and to consumers, and will to create a monopoly in the supply and sale of animal medicines.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s proposal will impose restrictions on farmers that will lead to increased costs and they will stifle what competition exists in the sale of animal medicines. By restricting the available outlets for such supplies the price will be controlled by a few vested interests and will be out of the competitive marketplace. Naturally, <Col N="157"/>this will lead to price increases and this will have a detrimental effect on Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>It will also cause increases in prices to the consumer and will lead to further inflation. Not only will the direct price of such medicines increase, but so will the indirect costs to farmers. With fewer outlets available to the farmer it will mean further expense in travel to find the product.</P>
      <P>Farmers already have enough costs and obstacles put in their way in trying to make a decent living for themselves and their families without having these restrictions proposed by the Minister. Life in rural Ireland is difficult enough for those of us who reside there. Farmers often cannot get planning permission to build houses for their children on their land and that combined with the lack of an adequate public transport system and the Government&rsquo;s pro-Dublin bias all are contributing to a reduction in the quality of life in rural areas.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The proposed legislation will only further the aims of this Government to remove people from rural areas and have the land controlled by a few well-heeled individuals who can gain vast amounts of money through monopolies and cartels. One can look back on the tribunals into such practices in the past and we can look forward to a range of further such tribunals should the proposed Government regulations go ahead, or maybe they have improved in being able to hide their doubtful practices. Because the regulations in Northern Ireland are more farmer friendly there will be an increase in cross-Border smuggling and this will create a black market for such products. This will endanger the economy and the health of animals as in such a situation the use of products will be beyond the control of anyone. This will lead to further corruption in the agriculture sector and will be detrimental to all of us.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P Just="Left">We must ensure that medium and small scale Irish farms remain viable businesses and that the people living in rural areas have a decent standard of living. We must ensure we remain competitive as agriculture is one of our biggest industries. If such practices were introduced in other business sectors, there would be uproar. However, the Government shows little regard for people in rural areas and seems to feel it can get away with yet another proposal to promote rural decline. It is time we put a stop to its gallop. It is time we made it aware of the views of people involved in rural businesses rather than leave it listening to its buddies in the business cartels of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have heard much from the Government about bird flu. God help this nation if bird flu hits us because we are currently making a damned bad job of trying to control the MRSA superbug that is rampant in our hospitals. I hope we never have the scourge of bird flu because if it is anything like the MRSA superbug, we will not be able to control it.</P>

	<P>The Green Party supports wholeheartedly the Fine Gael motion which ties in closely with an adjournment matter I raised last week on the matter of dairy farmers in my constituency and the issues affecting them, not least the demise in their numbers from approximately 200 in the 1960s to the remaining 22 that are hanging on for dear life in the face of a fast rising cost base and ruthless pricing from the creameries that still take their milk.</P>
      <P>This motion is more wide ranging and important in the sense that it relates to how the EU directive is being interpreted north and south of the Border. The Government should take into account that harmonisation of interpretation of this directive should be a key objective so there is not a continuance of what is almost traditional black marketeering due to differences on both sides of the Border. As the motion suggests, where there is a difference the Government must hold up a proper animal health regime for the whole island. This is vital if the island as a whole is to have a future in farming.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she is prepared to review the arrangements before they come into effect on 1 January 2007. I hope she follows through on this and that this is a real engagement with the difficulties being highlighted by this debate. There is an underlying assumption behind this directive which states implicitly that farmers need vets and other experts to tell them how to do their job. This debate has shown once again that farmers need to be able to administer essential medicines in the same manner parents need to administer medicines to their child. The cost base for a farmer is so tight now that this is more than just about veterinary and farming practice. It is about survival. I know this from talking to farmers in my constituency who are at the pin of their collars trying to carry on from year to year.</P>
      <P>I also know the situation from those outside my constituency, as do other Deputies. I received a letter from farmers in west Limerick the other day. They have serious issues with both the Environmental Protection Agency and local industry in their area. I hope these farmers are being listened to. Over the years they have reported the reasons they believe their animals have died and the mysterious situation in which they find their animals have been affected by environmental factors. They must now be believed. It has been proven that the EPA has not been doing its job properly in this regard.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Examiner</i> reported last week that the EPA, along with Departments had been telling farmers they were not affected by a particular industry &mdash; Aughinish Alumina is mentioned most often &mdash; and that the farmers were liars. However, it has been discovered that the farmers were right all along. This may be too late for many of them who have suffered problems, not <Col N="159"/>just with their animals but for themselves and their families also.</P>
      <P>I call on the Taoiseach to come clean on this issue following his visit to west Limerick last year. When he was questioned about the health concerns of local people with regard to themselves and their animals at the time, he defended local industry &mdash; he was referring to Aughinish Alumina &mdash; as the most regulated in the world. There is a need for a must closer investigation into what has been happening in west Limerick. This debate may finish at 8.30 p.m. tonight. However, the investigation into the animal health problems in west Limerick should be intensified because the abuse of farm families and their animals there is nothing short of criminal. I support the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion as it draws attention to a number of issues that currently affect the farming community. At a time of increasing costs, the legislation changing the manner in which farmers have access to animal medicines will only serve to add to the burden of farmers.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies received considerable numbers of representations from both farmers and those involved in local co-operatives while the Veterinary Bill was being debated. Complaints regarding the new legislation continue. Changes with regard to the sale of animal medicines are both unnecessary and costly. There is no reason many of the products required by farmers for the day to day running of their farms must be accessed in the manner proposed. Of course we need to have controls over the type of products that are available, but the general consensus among farmers is that there are already adequate controls in place. It could also be argued that these regulations will create an underground economy with sinister people more than willing to fill the demand that will exist.</P>
      <P>We must refer to a number of other issues affecting farming in the context of any debate on the sector. There are too few opportunities for this debate. The issue currently foremost in people&rsquo;s minds is the proposal by EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson to undermine the single farm payment as part of the forthcoming negotiations at the World Trade Organisation. We have already seen the Irish sugar beet sector damaged as part of efforts to strike trade deals. I trust the Minister and the Government will strenuously oppose any further moves that will damage the viability of farming in this country and in the EU generally.</P>
      <P>When the CAP reform package was agreed, the clear understanding was that there would be no changes to the new regime until at least 2013. The majority of farmers accepted decoupling on that basis and I welcomed it at the time as a possible means to establish basic income security for a set <Col N="160"/>period. I believed it could also be used to allow farmers here to alter their production with a guarantee of not having to produce in order to earn specific subsidies and premia.</P>
      <P>If Mr. Mandelson is allowed to place the current regime on the table at the WTO talks in order to strike a bargain with the United States and other trading blocs, the entire CAP reform will be placed in jeopardy. It is vital, therefore, that the issue is discussed at EU level by the different agriculture Ministers. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, will convey the feelings of farmers here on the proposal that it should not be allowed to proceed.</P>
      <P>Another issue that threatens the reputation of this country as the origin of safe and healthy food is the ongoing effort to open up the EU to genetically modified products. The Government continues to acquiesce in the EU&rsquo;s efforts by failing to oppose genetic modification at EU level. As a consequence, we have seen a series of authorisations of genetically modified products, including animal feed, which if introduced into this country&rsquo;s food system will mean that Ireland will no longer be regarded as a producer of traditional or organically grown produce. When one considers that most consumers are hostile to genetically modified food, the Government&rsquo;s position might have serious and damaging consequences for Irish farming and the marketing of Irish food.</P>
      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion, the intention of which is to help farmers who have faced and are facing difficult times. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Naughten, for bringing it to the House. I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to support Irish farmers. There have been major changes in the farming sector. Costs have increased significantly and profits have decreased. Many farmers have been forced to vote with their feet by leaving the farming industry. The number of people in full-time farming has decreased substantially over the last two decades. If we do not halt the decline in farming and the drop in the involvement of farmers in rural communities, there will be a sea-change in the nature of rural society.</P>
      <P>Farmers are being strangled by red tape and excessive regulation. When we visit the Continent, we cannot understand how many practices which would not be tolerated here continue to be carried out there. The nitrates directive will lead to enormous costs if it ever comes to fruition. We often hear of farmers who must sell sites to meet <Col N="161"/>the cost of new regulations. They will no longer be able to do that if the planning permission guidelines come into force.</P>
      <P>Veterinary expenses have increased by 44% over the past ten years. We have noted the results of the imposition of restrictions on the sale of antibiotics to veterinarians and pharmacists. The antibiotic Penstrep, for example, could have been purchased for between &euro;3 and &euro;4 per 100 mg before restrictions were imposed on its sale. It now costs between &euro;12 and &euro;14 to purchase it from veterinarians and between &euro;6 and &euro;8 to buy it from pharmacies. It is clear that the imposition of restrictions on the sale of antibiotics has dramatically increased their cost. A P13 IBR vaccine bought in this country costs &euro;8.50 per animal, compared with 91 cents in the United States as a result of restrictions on the distribution of medicines. The discrepancy in its cost results from the restrictions on the distribution of medicines to farmers.</P>
      <P>If we adopt the approach suggested by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, what will be the implications for the overall market price of veterinary medicines? The current system will be able to remain in operation if we give member states the responsibility to designate who is qualified to prescribe various medicines. Why do we need to make the proposed change? The system is working well. Our food products have a very high status in international markets. Irish food products are seen as green, environmentally friendly and free from difficulties. Why should we change the current procedures if we do not have to? When the representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food discussed this directive at EU level, they expressed their opposition to it. I do not understand the Department&rsquo;s U-turn in this regard. Why is it insisting that the directive be recognised in this manner, which is not necessary?</P>
      <P>I remind the House of the views of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, as outlined at a joint committee meeting today. According to the union:</P>
      <P LI="1">The draft veterinary medicines regulations, if implemented, will squeeze pharmacists out of the veterinary medicines market. This should not be allowed to happen. Pharmacists should be given limited prescribing rights so that they can prescribe products currently available without prescription and a small range of other products, such as flea treatment for dogs, ringworm treatments and trace elements, copper, magnesium, iodine, calcium and selenium. Failure to do so will undermine competition, increase costs to farmers and deprive them of a choice and, in many cases, reduce access to frequently used medicines.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Fine Gael is concerned that many pharmacies will not prescribe medicines because demand for prescriptions will shift elsewhere. The Minister <Col N="162"/>should respond positively to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s motion. She needs to examine seriously her position on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I found it difficult to understand the Minister for Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s speech on this motion. I think she was trying to say that although the Government has signed up to the directive, we should not be concerned because it does not intend to implement it. I know Fianna F&aacute;il is fairly good at tricking the public by pulling the wool over its eyes, but the public does not believe it any more. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is a decent man. I regret that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is not present.</P>
      <P>I welcome the honesty of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who said today that Fianna F&aacute;il has been almost exclusively in Government for the last 18 years. His comments were a change from Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s references to &ldquo;successive Governments&rdquo;, which has been its mantra since it started to plummet in the polls. The party that has been almost exclusively in Government for 18 years has presided over an unprecedented flight from the land during that period.</P>
      <P>The Government made many pronouncements this time last year about the freedom to farm, the new dawn for farmers, the Government&rsquo;s great commitment to farming, decoupling, modulation and the end to red tape. It now looks like all we are getting is modulation and even that is on a downward trend. The Government is trying to rewrite an agreement that was agreed a short time ago. The Government consistently said at that time that farmers need to be able to plan, to know what is happening and to be given some freedom. It claimed that the end of red tape would be followed by a great new dawn. Twelve months on, however, we are talking about the <Col N="163"/>Government&rsquo;s plans to require farmers, who have been using such products for many years to get prescriptions for dry cow tubes. It is telling farmers that they will have to go to vets to get prescriptions for such tubes. I always thought the main Government party was pragmatic, but it has changed if it is asking farmers to get prescriptions for doses and intramammaries. I find it difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>Despite the Government&rsquo;s commitment to consult interested parties about the proposed changes, I have not met a farmer or vet who agrees with the changes. The Irish Veterinary Union sent me a letter expressing its feelings about the matter. I cannot see what the changes will achieve. Ireland exports 90% of its meat products. Farmers are mindful of food safety issues and the need to produce a quality product because they know they will suffer if there is a blip in food quality. Irish milk is tested rigorously for residue and random tests are carried out on meat. Farmers know they will suffer the consequences if they fail such tests. What is the point of putting this extra burden on farmers? I refer to the inconvenience to farmers of trying to source vets, for example. It can be very difficult to find vets in many areas. The Irish Veterinary Union spoke about competition among vets, but very few parts of the country have more than one vet. There are no vets at all in places like north Mayo. The proposed changes, which will give rise to hardship and additional costs, will achieve nothing.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This is a sad day. Successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments have put the boot into farmers over the past 18 years. They have been taken in hook, line and sinker by the mantras which have emerged from the Department of Agriculture and Food. No Minister has stood up to the Department&rsquo;s blather. If one reads the reports on the website of the EU investigation office, one will learn that many places did not reach the required standard and that many investigations were not carried out in the required manner. A comment that sticks in my mind is the suggestion that the Irish officials went over and above what was required in the EU directive.</P>
      <P>I call on all colleagues in the House to support this worthwhile motion, as I will. I ask those inclined to do otherwise if they really believe the Minister will reverse this in a number of months. Why sign up to it if she intends to reverse it? I commend the motion to the House. I hope in particular that the Independent Deputies, who may have supported the Government in the past, might show some common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It saddens me to speak on the motion because this regulation is another attack on farmers, farming and a way of life. There is a <Col N="164"/>regular attack from the Department of Agriculture and Food and a regular attack from Europe. Deputy Timmins is correct; when directives and regulations emerge from the European Union, every other country involved adopts part of what is proposed but we in this country always have to go six steps further.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As we often discuss Europe, I will tell the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, a simple story. A constituent of mine made a complaint to the EU, the same EU that is complaining to the Government and telling us how to regulate our lives, farming and the whole world. This man spent a colossal amount of money to prepare, register and send a document. It was accepted by an official &mdash; I will be careful what I call him because the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might restrain me. Anyway, since the day the documentation was delivered, it cannot be found.</P>
      <P>The directives emerging from the EU are no surprise because they are probably all mixed up. The EU staff do not have a lot to do. It is full of officials, yet Ministers and officials from the Department fly over daily with their new briefcases. I think they go for the spin or to keep up their points with Aer Lingus and Ryanair, because it is certain they do not know what is going on. Anyone who would adopt this regulation is out of touch with the real world.</P>
      <P>Farmers have been complaining for the past 20 years about form-filling and being over-regulated, yet a similar situation arises with this regulation. Deputy Timmins is half right about north Mayo &mdash; there is a vet there. The Erris area is as large as County Louth so a second vet was to go there. However, he gave up his practice and went to work for the Department. Why did he do this? It was probably a better and easier job. He will deal with the officials of the Department, who will keep him informed as to what is happening. He is a great man with the pen so I am sure he will get plenty of paperwork from the Department, which is all it is good for.</P>
      <P>With regard to the regulation, what is a farmer in Pollathomas, Rossport or any other part of County Mayo to do if he has a sick animal at 3 a.m? There is one vet in the area, who might be 30 or 40 miles away. Should he telephone that vet, who might have been working all that day, and ask him or her to visit in the middle of the night? Does anyone think that a vet will visit a sick animal at that time of night to write a prescription?</P>
      <P>If we have learned anything in this country, we should have learned from the General Medical Service scheme, which deals with a similar situation. Under this scheme, pharmacies are not overpaid because, whatever the medication costs, they receive a handling charge of some &euro;2.80 to &euro;3 per transaction, which is fine. It is enough to have doctors getting paid to write prescriptions, as well as getting paid through the GMS scheme <Col N="165"/>and the drugs subsidy scheme, without having vets copy the GMS scheme. Vets will be paid and in three years or so we will have to put down freedom of information requests to find out about all the deals and negotiations that have taken place. Half the budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food will go to vets instead of going to farmers.</P>
      <P>Farmers have had enough of this. They are sick and tired of being attacked &mdash; Blair is at it in Britain, attacking a deal done on the single farm payment. It is not good enough. Young farmers, men and women, complain to me and every rural Deputy, including Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, if they are listening.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt was correct this morning to state that the Government has been implementing its policies for almost 18 years. What is wrong is that the Government no longer thinks this is a democracy but a dictatorship. It thinks it can do what it wants and disorganise the lives of the people, particularly in rural Ireland. The people have had enough of the Government. They await their opportunity. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, should enjoy his little stint. He would be as well to keep it running for two years because the tank is empty. The people are waiting. They have had enough of over-regulation.</P>
      <P>The Government should leave the regulation as it is. I call on the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers to support the motion. I will not call on the Independent Deputies because there is only one independent in this House &mdash; myself. The rest of the Independents run behind the Government parties even though they are elected. They take the &euro;35,000 they are allocated as Independents but they are certainly not independent.</P>
      <P>The current regulation is working. Farming is under pressure and has been for many years. There is no logic in the new regulation. Some brain box in Europe was asked by his boss to do some work so he thought up this idea and sent it to the Department of Agriculture and Food. The staff there do not have as much work as previously due to the introduction of the single farm payment. They have more time on their hands so all they do is cause problems for farmers with REPS payments and other matters. I recently put down a question to the Minister about the fact that despite the single payment and the new agricultural rules and regulations, the Department still has the same number of staff. As there have been no reductions, some job must be found for the staff. The Department thought of a job for them, namely, to annoy farmers more for fear they have not been annoyed for the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>To carry on from Deputy Ring, the present system is working so why break it? Ireland&rsquo;s current system is a model for the rest of Europe and has gained Irish farmers an inter<Col N="166"/>national reputation as a high quality food producer. This is why we are so successful at exporting our dairy and beef produce across the world.</P>
      <P>Instead of reclassifying veterinary medicines into different categories that can be prescribed by registered professionals with graded levels of qualifications and competences, the approach outlined in the draft regulations published by the Department of Agriculture and Food in August would impose a rigid veterinary prescription only regime while applying for exemptions from the prescription requirement at European level. This will not work for the reasons outlined by my colleagues. In some parts of the country, vets are not available and the regulation will make it difficult for farmers who have administered certain medicines for years in the knowledge that if they did anything wrong, they could jeopardise not only their own livelihoods but those of other farmers.</P>
      <P>The most effective way of ensuring high levels of animal health and welfare is to encourage farmers and animal owners to take a preventative approach where veterinary medicines are concerned. This can best be done by enabling them to procure and administer routine management drugs, such as external and internal parasiticides and vaccines, as easily and as early as possible. Vets should continue to be called for cases requiring a clinical diagnosis or the prescription of antibiotics, steroids and other high risk medicines. However, the draft regulations should make provisions for differentiated categories of drugs which can be prescribed by other professionals who are qualified to do so, such as licensed merchants, agricultural scientists, pharmacists and others.</P>
      <P>This restrictive regime, which will be introduced if the regulation is adopted in Ireland in the manner proposed, will have major implications for the farming industry throughout the country. A further worry is the cross-Border distortion of the market in veterinary medicine products that will be introduced. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, will be very familiar with the type of cross-Border smuggling that took place in the past, particularly with regard to angel dust and other cattle hormones. If the regulation is introduced, there will be another, totally different black market. Unless there is a common regime in this country, north and south of the Border, a very dangerous precedent will be set if this is introduced. I mean that sincerely given what happened in the past. Most of the angel dust, illegal growth promoters, etc. which came into this country came from the North, as the Ministers of State know. It involved a major racket.</P>
      <P>Farmers have been very responsible, despite what people say about them, as have vets. Vets and farmers have a very successful partnership and together they have ensured we have one of <Col N="167"/>the best products in the world. That must be acknowledged. No vet contacted me about this proposed regime, or lobbied me to have it introduced. However, a number of farmers contacted me. Vets&rsquo; livelihoods will not be threatened in any way if this is not introduced because they have enough work to do. They are expanding into several areas rather than confining themselves to farming.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister and Ministers of State to rethink the proposed regime as it is very important that they do so. I appeal to the Ministers of State, two practical people and, I hope, pragmatists, not to allow this to develop. They are accompanied by a very good civil servant who I worked with in the past who will advise them properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies on both sides of the House for their constructive contributions to the debate. I am aware of the concerns of farmers in particular about the possible implications of the draft regulations for the supply and cost of veterinary medicines, but I emphasise that most of these concerns are based on a misunderstanding of the real position which the Minister explained in considerable detail last evening. These concerns arise, in particular, from the requirement in the EU directive that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescriptions. However, implementation of this provision is being postponed until a decision is taken at EU level on the criteria for exempting certain medicines from this new requirement or until 1 January 2007 at the latest.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, in so far as the issue of prescribing veterinary medicines is concerned, the only change arising from the draft regulations is that apart from intramammaries, all other off-prescription medicines will remain off-prescription until 1 January 2007. The suggestion was made during the debate last night that some of the POME medicines could be classified by the Irish Medicines Board as prescription only before 1 January 2007. Given the nature of the work involved in the re-classification of medicines and the overall policy of my Department that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained in so far as possible, these medicines will not be reclassified in advance of a resolution of the exemption criteria issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister made it clear that she intends to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible and the Department has made a submission to the European Commission with a view to retaining off prescription in Ireland all products, other than intramammaries, which currently enjoy this status. There is no reason to believe, as was suggested by Deputy Naughten, that the criteria will not be adopted until <Col N="168"/>November 2006. As the Minister said yesterday, the Commission has undertaken to publish the criteria next spring and my Department will continue to press it to honour this commitment.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that we should provide in the regulations at this stage to permit qualified professionals, other than vets, to write prescriptions is both mistaken and defeatist. In essence, what is being suggested is that my Department should throw in the towel before the fight, or in this case before the negotiations on the exemptions criteria start. It is not practicable to take a decision to extend the range of prescribers until we know what additional medicines will become prescription-only. In any event, it would be extremely foolish to provide at this stage for prescriptions to be written by people other than vets because to do so would also necessarily oblige me to designate as prescription-only some medicines currently off prescription.</P>
      <P>More importantly, it would completely undermine our negotiating position on the exemption criteria if I were to re-categorise unilaterally at this stage some off-prescription medicines as prescription-only. My Department&rsquo;s approach of deferring a decision on whether it will be necessary to extend the range of prescribers until the exemption criteria issue is resolved is the best approach to take in the circumstances I have outlined. The Minister has undertaken to consider this issue next year in light of the EU decision on the criteria for exempting certain products from the prescription only requirement.</P>
      <P>Our overall objective in making these regulations is to put in place a workable and competitive system for the distribution of medicines within the parameters of the EU directive which at the same time protects public and animal health, facilitates our food export trade and minimises costs for producers. We have achieved a delicate balance between all of these competing objectives. In particular, the draft regulations include a range of measures designed to make the arrangements for prescribing and supplying medicines more farmer-friendly and to introduce a greater degree of competition into the market for veterinary medicines.</P>
      <P>The most important of these are as follows. We are removing the general requirement on veterinary practitioners to examine animals clinically before prescribing, thus according greater weight to professional judgment. We are extending the period of validity of prescriptions from 31 days to six months. We are introducing a new requirement that veterinary practitioners must, in all cases, issue written prescriptions even if the practitioner supplies the medicine. Also, the vet must issue the client with an invoice for supplying the product which is distinct from the invoice in respect of the provision of professional services. We are providing for the first time that prescribed veterinary medicines may, with certain excep<Col N="169"/>tions, be supplied by licensed merchant outlets. These amendments will result in a regime which is more coherent, effective and workable. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>We had a long discussion on the Brazilian beef issue at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. The one aspect the IFA delegation welcomed was that there was unanimous backing for a total ban on beef from Brazil. I notice some Deputies in the House congratulated the Minister on what she had done but it is important she listens and recognises that there is anxiety&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot ban Brazilian beef. The Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a genuine wish for a total ban on such beef. There was unanimous agreement on that issue which the Minister can accept if she wishes.</P>
      <P>Some of her colleagues talked about the meetings they had with vets and farmers. We have all had such meetings and had to listen to people talk about the difficulties these regulations will create. Exemptions will be in place for the time being. The fact this issue does not have to be dealt with until January 2006 reminds me of the nitrates directive which we kept putting off saying decisions would not be taken until later and that there would be wide consultation and so on. What gets me is the fact that intramammaries will not be off prescription.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was not present for all the Minister&rsquo;s speech but she said the House was no doubt aware of the growing concerns about the growth of antibiotic resistance, particularly over the past ten years. She went on to talk about the World Health Organisation, the organisation which allows hormones, steroids and so on to be used in America without a word said while we must meet all sorts of regulations. The Minister also referred to the Irish Medicines Board&rsquo;s anxiety about intramammaries. She also said the creameries were quite successful. I wonder why the speech writer thought it was necessary to insert the words &ldquo;quite successful&rdquo;. Members involved in farming know that creameries have been extremely suc<Col N="170"/>cessful in regulating intramammaries under existing mechanisms. We then heard about international scientific opinion on the prudent use of antibiotics. We also heard about the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor who had no option to introduce an alternative system. Many other reasons were listed why this regulation was drafted. A farmer can buy intramammaries or dry tubes from his vet or co-operative store, provided he works within legislation. The farmer then ensures the tubes are used properly because he knows it is wrong to do otherwise. More importantly, he knows if he is found out through testing of the milk tank, he will lose much money.</P>

However, before the regulation is signed she will have a chance.Will the Minister for Agriculture and Food explain to the House how the veterinary prescription will change? The farmer will still utilise intramammaries and ensure the milk leaves the farm in a perfect state. Before she signs this regulation, will the Minister go to a co-operative to see how this process is monitored. After collection from the farm, a tanker of milk is brought to the co-operative. A sample is removed from it before it is utilised.</P>

	<P>It is a pity she did not address those issues. Last night the Minister claimed that allowing non-vets to prescribe at this stage would completely undermine our negotiating position. She was not worried about undermining her negotiating position when she turned her back on the farmers in the midlands and the south east on the closure of the Carlow sugar factory. She was not prepared to become involved in it which directly undermined our negotiating position in the sugar reform talks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we expected to start eating cats and dogs? The directive specifically deals with medicines for animals for human consumption. The Minister is relying on an exemption list. She is hoping to convince the other 24 EU member states that a range of medicines will be removed from the prescription-only regime throughout the EU. In her contribution she said the position in most member states, apart from the UK, is that the writing of prescriptions is confined to vets from which they do not intend to depart. How does the Minister hope to get unanimous agreement that these medicines should be exempt from a prescription in Ireland and in those other EU member states? She will not get their agreement to take prescriptions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy want exemptions?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="176"/>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should think about it. She will not get the agreement of 25 member states to make what are now prescription only medicines exempt throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>The Minister and some Government Deputies focused on public health and residues. There is not a problem with residues in this country because farmers comply with withdrawal periods. Forcing farmers to get a prescription from a vet who has not been on their farm for maybe 12 months will not ensure compliance with the withdrawal period. It has nothing to do with residue and nothing to do with withdrawal periods.</P>
      <P>This directive will be passed into law before the end of this month, not some time next year. It will be too late to review it after that because it will be on the Statute Book. If the Minister is genuine about this she will agree with the motion, as will the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who did not even think it worth his while to come into the House. If all the backbench Deputies who have travelled around the country stabbing the Minister in the back by saying they do not agree with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P Just="Left">Many of the Government Deputies who spoke tonight were sensible. They did not mention the Minister&rsquo;s amendment but talked about avian flu, the dairy industry and the beef industry. They ignored the issue because they know she is wrong, she will crucify farmers and put them out on the road.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this important question to be addressed in the House tonight. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, for taking the question.</P>
        <P>Clonakilty in County Cork was identified as the location for the decentralisation of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the first week of December 2003. Two years later, not a stroke has been struck in Clonakilty with regard to this <Col N="180"/>matter. All of 2004 was spent in reconnoitring the town. Eventually, in May 2005, a site was acquired. An advertisement appeared in 2004 asking for expressions of interest to construct office accommodation for this proposed decentralisation and, to date, no tendering arrangements have been put in place.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My problem is that 215 people volunteered to go to Cork, of their own volition and without any arm twisting. These people, along with their parents, are now making representations to me seeking to find out when the new office accommodation will be available. I have made representations a number of times on this matter.</P>
        <P>In one such representation, I received a reply from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, dated 25 August 2005 stating that &ldquo;subject to agreement of the briefs, the OPW expects to be in a position to invite ten<Col N="181"/>ders in the next few weeks&rdquo;. I then received a letter from the same Minister of State on 11 October stating that:</P>
        <P LI="1">[I]n relation to BIM, the OPW recently met with representatives of BIM with a view to finalising their brief of requirements. The OPW is pressing for an early resolution of the matter and subject to agreements we will then be able to go to tender.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I then decided to table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I received a reply in Question No. 432 of 18 October stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">I expect consultation between the Department, BIM and the OPW, on the fit out and design elements in each organisation&rsquo;s specification, to get under way shortly[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to tell me when this procrastination and vacillation will stop. As for the people who have volunteered to return to their roots in west Cork, can they be given any hope, or is this all a mirage? I want a definite and specific commitment that the 215 staff from the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources and Bord Iascaigh Mhara who have volunteered to go to Clonakilty will be accommodated there. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who has special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I thank Deputy Walsh for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the office accommodation for the decentralisation of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Clonakilty in County Cork. I acknowledge the absolute commitment of Deputy Walsh to the decentralisation project to Clonakilty and his constant representations in that respect, particularly on behalf of those people who have indicated their willingness to decentralise. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, has apologised for not being present but had a prior engagement in County Westmeath which was arranged some weeks ago. My understanding is that he has communicated this information to Deputy Walsh.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a site has been acquired by the OPW at Clonakilty for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. It is proposed to provide accommodation for 124 <Col N="182"/>staff of the Department and accommodation for 97 staff, including three local staff, for Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The OPW has agreed the brief of requirements with the Department. A number of issues were raised at a recent meeting between the OPW and Bord Iascaigh Mhara and these issues are being examined.</P>
        <P>Deputy Walsh should be aware that Bord Iascaigh Mhara requires significant on-site storage facilities. The OPW is carrying out an implementation study to ascertain how these facilities can best be accommodated on the site. It expects to have this work completed within a week.</P>
        <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara raised the question of providing cr&egrave;che facilities. The provision of such facilities at decentralised offices was dealt with by the implementation group in its report of June 2004. It recommended that cr&egrave;che facilities are a matter for the relevant Department to pursue given its own requirements and facilities available in the locality. Bord Iascaigh Mhara is also seeking to have its existing sea food development centre increased in size and officials in the OPW are in consultation with Bord Iascaigh Mhara on this matter.</P>
        <P>It is the intention of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to meet members of the board of Bord Iascaigh Mhara on 25 October to discuss the matter further and the OPW intends pressing to have all issues resolved by the end of October 2005. Subject to such resolution, the OPW would be in a position to invite tenders before the end of November 2005.</P>

      <sTitle>Schools Building Programme.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter. Gaelscoil na Cruaiche is doing a wonderful job and is a great success. In September 2005, 197 pupils were enrolled, there were nine permanent staff, one full-time and three part-time special needs staff and eight part-time ancillary staff. Already, 210 pupils are enrolled for September 2006. At the moment, it exists in a five prefabs in poor condition, a serious health and safety issue. Its lease will expire at the end of next May but this lease is non-renewable. Therefore, it must have everything off the site at the end of that school term. As such, the school must be included in the building programme to ensure accommodation on January 2006.</P>
        <P>I have raised this matter repeatedly and the answers I received include in December 2004 that the property management section of the Office of Public Works was exploring the possibility of acquiring a site and on 28 September that site negotiations are under way and once the site is finalised, the project will be considered in pro<Col N="183"/>gression in the context of the building programme. Despite this, on 13 October 2005, I was informed by the Minister of Education and Science:</P>
        <P LI="1">The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department regarding site acquisitions generally, has identified a suitable site for the school referred to by the Deputy. The OPW has been in contact with a vendor regarding the acquisition of a site and is now awaiting a response.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We need to know if this school is on the building list. The Minister guaranteed that once the site was secured, this would be the case. The Minister told me that when a school is needed, a school would be built. I urgently ask the Minister of State to give an undertaking tonight that a school will be provided. Otherwise, 197 pupils will be on the street, 210 by next year.</P>
        <P>This issue has been well flagged. The Department has been aware for the past four or five years at least that the lease would expire and nothing less than a commitment tonight will do. Will the school be included in the building programme? Will the pupils be out on the road or will they have a new school? If not, why not? These pupils deserve the very best as they and their teachers have worked very hard and deserve more than to be left in this limbo situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter. We now know a site has been identified and bought, as the OPW has agreed a price. It is a matter for the Westport Town Council. As the Minister of State knows, the council can buy all the land it wants but cannot sell a blade of grass without a council meeting and this issue will be on the agenda over the next week or two.</P>
        <P>We have fought long and hard to get the site. It has been identified and I hope it will be in the possession of the OPW in a very short time but what is now needed is a commitment from the Department of Education and Science that the school will be included in the schools building programme for next year.</P>
        <P>Gaelscoil na Cruaiche has been a major success and many parents are worried about the conditions their children must be educated in. The teachers, staff and management of the school are quite concerned. As Deputy Cowley said, the school&rsquo;s lease is up next year. It is important to include it in the programme as, for the town of Westport and the teachers, pupils and management of the school, it is necessary.</P>
        <P>This school has waited a long time. The people involved have been very patient. If a number of steps must be jumped, it must happen because we do not want to still be fighting this time next year to get the school included in the programme. We <Col N="184"/>want a commitment from the Minister for Education and Science that these children will be approved a new school, the project will go out to tender and we will see the school built sometime next year so that pupils can look forward to entering their new school the following September.</P>
        <P>The site has been found, identified and a price agreed. I want the Minister to make a commitment to the west, particularly Westport. Recent announcements were made concerning the schools building programme and I hope the Minister will announce over the next day or two that this school will be included in the programme for next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Ring and Cowley for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the proposals of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of a new facility for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche, Westport, County Mayo. Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.</P>
        <P>None the less, since taking office, this Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum. We progressively increased funding for the school modernisation programme in recent years to achieve our goal, with an aggregate total of almost &euro;2 billion allocated for this purpose since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of the year, the Minister for Education and Science has made a number of announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, &euro;270 million will be allocated to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools for building works. The Minister recently announced an investment of &euro;555 million over the next four years in projects to be delivered by way of public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>Gaelscoil na Cruaiche opened in September 1996 with provisional recognition and was then granted permanent recognition in 2000. The school is currently accommodated in prefabricated classrooms on a three quarter acre site in the town of Westport. The cost of site and classroom rental is grant-aided by the Department of Education and Science at the rate of 95%. Provision is built into the schools building programme to enable schools to address urgent health and safety problems. Primary schools are given an annual allocation, currently amounting to &euro;3,809 plus &euro;12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works, which can be used <Col N="185"/>entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school itself and its infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which purchases sites for new schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, was requested to explore the possibility of acquiring a site for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche. Following the most recent advertisement placed by the OPW seeking proposals of possible sites, a number of responses were received. The OPW arranged technical assessments of a number of sites to consider their suitability as a location for the Gaelscoil. The OPW has now commenced negotiation for the purchase of a site for the school.</P>
        <P>Due to commercial sensitivities, I am unable to comment further on specific site acquisitions but I can assure the Deputies that the permanent accommodation needs of this school are being addressed as expeditiously as possible and that the provision of a permanent building for the school will be progressed in the context of the school buildings and modernisation programme when the site has been acquired.</P>
        <P>As the board and patrons are already aware, the provision of interim accommodation remains the responsibility of the board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I hope that, when the Minister of State replies, he will not refer to land initiative programmes in the area of Doneraile. The estimated cost of the sewer length is &euro;173,340 excluding VAT and the proposed turnpike at the Skaghardgannon extension would collect sewage from 15 houses. The Doneraile sewerage scheme has not been completed. The residents in the Skaghardgannon area recently received a letter from the environmental department of Cork County Council, stating that incidents of pollution had occurred in the area. The problem arises from the failure of the county council to provide a drain, which it was to have done at an earlier stage. That is creating a serious problem for the residents.</P>
        <P>Given that the general main scheme is not completed, now is the time for the Minister to grant permission. Two areas, Turnpike and Skaghardgannon, are involved. I refer solely to Skaghardgannon. I received correspondence from a former Minister who stated a decision to include Skaghardgannon in the Turnpike cross sewer <Col N="186"/>extension of the Doneraile sewerage scheme is ultimately a matter for Cork County Council. It is not. The main scheme and the various links made in the Doneraile area were done by the Department, and Skaghardgannon should be included. I hope the Minister of State will be positive in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position. My Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2004 to 2006, published in May 2004, includes funding for 97 schemes throughout County Cork. As a Corkman, I am proud that the entire county will benefit from the Government&rsquo;s extensive investment in new infrastructure under the national development plan. In total, almost &euro;543 million has been allocated under the water services programme for new water and sewerage schemes in Cork.</P>
        <P>The Doneraile sewerage scheme was approved for funding as part of this package. The scheme consists of a new waste water treatment plant and sewage collection system and will cost more than &euro;2.5 million. The waste water treatment plant for Doneraile will be procured as part of a grouped contract that will also include new treatment plants for Buttevant and Kilbrin. My Department is examining Cork County Council&rsquo;s tender documents for this contract. Although they were only submitted in recent weeks, the Department expects to be in a position to convey a decision to the council shortly. I assure Deputy Sherlock that I am just as anxious as he is to see approval being given to the council to commence work on this scheme at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>The collection system for the Doneraile scheme is advanced as a separate stand-alone contract. Construction commenced in November 2004 on this element of the scheme. It does not extend to Skaghardgannon, and I understand it is close to completion. My Department has approved Cork County Council&rsquo;s proposals to add two sewer extensions to the Doneraile scheme, one from Turnpike Cross to Skaghardgannon on which Deputy Sherlock raised this issue, and the second from the industrial zoned area north of Turnpike Cross to Brough Cross.</P>
        <P>The Department indicated to the council that it is willing to fund both extensions in accordance with the terms of the serviced land initiative. Under this measure the Department provides 40% of the capital funding for approved works on the basis that they will contribute to the supply of serviced residential sites and thus increase the availability of new houses for prospective purchasers. In putting forward this proposal, my Department saw an opportunity to provide waste water facilities for existing residents in conjunction with the provision of services to respond to the high potential for future residential develop<Col N="187"/>ment along both sewer lengths and, in addition, the existence of an industrial zoned area along the Turnpike Cross-Brough Cross branch that would also be connected.</P>
        <P>Without the other development, both sewer extensions would serve no more than 30 existing houses at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;600,000. The resulting average cost per house would be prohibitive and would not be justified on economic grounds by comparison with the cost of a proprietary single house treatment system that an individual householder could install to replace a malfunctioning septic tank.</P>
        <P>The idea of funding the proposed sewer extensions under the terms of the serviced land initiative was put forward by my Department to try to find a way to help the householders involved. It would allow the householders to benefit from services that would be put in place with part-funding from my Department to serve potential new development in the area. If Cork County Council is interested in proceeding with this option, my Department is still prepared to meet 40% of the approved costs. The remainder would need to be recouped by the council from developers, including any borrowing costs the council might incur on its investment in the meantime.</P>
        <P>Another alternative the council could consider would be to fund the sewer extension to Skaghardgannon from the annual rural water programme allocation it receives from my Department. Cork County Council has a total allocation of &euro;2.4 million under this programme for small public schemes in 2005 and will benefit from further allocations in the years ahead. The council has complete discretion with the prioritisation of individual schemes under this measure and any decision to fund the Skaghardgannon extension would be entirely within its own remit. A number of options are open to Cork County Council. To a large extent the solution is dependent on Cork County Council, and the Department is prepared to co-operate in any way possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, is present for this debate. I wish to focus attention on a serious issue affecting the people of Ennis. One takes for granted the quality of one&rsquo;s drinking water if issues regarding that quality do not arise. The Minister of State may be aware through coverage by the national media that for some time the county town&rsquo;s 25,000 residents have experienced problems with the water supply. It is partly a legacy of the rapid expansion of the town which 20 years ago had a population of approximately 10,000.</P>
        <P>The result is that at different periods, particularly after heavy rainfall or a long dry spell, the town council, in consultation with the HSE, must <Col N="188"/>issue a boil notice because of the risk of ingesting e-coli bacteria. The long-term solution is the provision of the sanctioned &euro;6.5 million filtration plant which is not due to be completed until late 2007. That is two years from now.</P>
        <P>The short-term solution is the provision of tankers of fresh water which could be augmented by the supply of bottled water for free or at a subsidised rate. Not everyone has a car to transport large containers of water. Another possible short-term solution is an investigation into the contamination source of the Ennis water supply. This could be conducted by a team of specialist consultant engineers. It would require departmental funding but that would be money well spent and would contribute to the long-term viability of the water. Much work has been done on the groundwater flows following an environmental impact study of the River Fergus drainage scheme. An extension of that type of study would be worthwhile and might contribute to the improvement of the town&rsquo;s water supply. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider this option seriously.</P>
        <P>The issue is partly one of confidence, which has been eroded among the people of Ennis. Further afield, the message has gone out that one should not drink the water in Ennis. It does not make the winner of the 2005 Tidy Towns competition an attractive place in which to live or invest. Despite the assurances of the town council that a partial boil notice covering young people, children and immuno-deficient people is a precautionary measure, confidence in the town&rsquo;s water supply is at an all-time low.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to impress on the county manager the necessity to sanction the use of tankers of fresh water without delay. I understand this would involve considerable expense over a two-year period. Perhaps an allocation of funds might be made for this unique situation. It is unacceptable that people of limited means, particularly parents of young children, should either pay for overpriced bottled water in supermarkets or experience the cost and inconvenience of boiling water. This is a stealth tax. With bottled water more expensive than petrol in many instances, people are paying rip-off prices. Their only alternative is to boil water. This is an expensive and not very palatable drink over a long period. The council says the &ldquo;boil&rdquo; notice currently applies to a small number of people. That is not the point, however. That a vulnerable group of people or those acting on their behalf are expected to fork out money to guarantee their fresh drinking water requirements is grossly unfair. The council has admitted that the water supply will be vulnerable until a new treatment plant is put in place. That simply is not good enough in terms of assessment of the water supply for a town the size of Ennis. An alternative to tankers might be a subsidised scheme of <Col N="189"/>bottled water in conjunction with one of the major bottling companies.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?>
        <P>Taxpayers should expect to have clean drinking water. I commend those businesses that have reduced their bottled water prices in Ennis. In this regard, I ask the water supply companies, wholesalers and supermarkets, to take a look at their pricing policies. All this underlines the urgency of a speedy end to the filtration project. I understand work on the plant will not start until next year and that the Department has approved the council&rsquo;s tender documents with some amendments. Five short-listed consortiums will have a four-month period to respond to those tenders. In turn, the analysis of those responses will take some time. The official reckoning is that this project will take up to two years to complete. Then it is expected the eventual contractor will require 15 months to commission and build the plant.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to do all in his power to speed up the process. I understand it is complex, involving design, build and operate contracts. However, in this case even weeks and months could make a difference to the quality of people&rsquo;s lives. There may be other mechanisms by which the minimum notice period under the public procurement process could be amended, given the urgency of the situation. There may be other windows of opportunity where a sense of urgency could prevail. In the meantime, some form of State-sponsored fresh water scheme is the least Ennis residents can expect while the contamination problem is being resolved. I urge the Minister of State to look at those options in the short-term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to it. I visited Ennis a few weeks ago to see what the situation was on the ground and so have first-hand awareness of what residents and businesses have to contend with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I express my concern to the people of Ennis and surrounding areas who have been affected by the &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notices and echo the view that everything possible must be done to get this problem resolved. I am aware that there have been three &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notices since last May, including one last Friday, which, I understand, was caused by a technical failure at the source. I fully appreciate that having to boil water, necessary though it may be to protect public health, causes inconvenience, distress and anxiety and should not be a regular occurrence in any part of Ireland today.</P>
        <P>The problem with the Ennis water supply stems from the fact that the source is vulnerable to contamination, including contaminants from septic tanks or agricultural run off, and the only process the water is currently put though is chlorination. Disinfection by chlorination produces a good quality supply at nearly all times, but needs to be <Col N="190"/>supplemented by additional treatment to remove the occasional risk associated with chlorine resistant organisms in the water.</P>
        <P>The Ennis town water supply treatment scheme will put the necessary treatment facilities in place and has been approved for construction in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme at an estimated cost of &euro;6.5 million. The Minister has given clearance to Clare County Council to invite tenders for the scheme and the money for it is ready and waiting in the Department. The Department&rsquo;s officials have assisted the council to speed up the finalisation of the tender documents and the council has already short-listed a panel of suitable contractors who will be asked to tender for the scheme.</P>
        <P>Like everyone else in the House, I want to see the work getting under way at the earliest possible date. However, we must be realistic and remember that what we do now must solve the problem effectively and permanently. The reality is that we are looking at a period of about two years before that permanent solution is in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens in the meantime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>While this undoubtedly seems lengthy, the contractors will have to draw up and price, from scratch, a detailed design and specification, a construction programme, and a long-term operational and maintenance strategy. They will be required to demonstrate that they can supply the people of Ennis with a consistently high quality drinking water supply for the next 20 years that will be delivered at an economic cost to the council and to the non-domestic consumers who will have to pay for it. The design phase will take until next March. It quite simply cannot be completed any sooner without compromising the outcome to the long-term detriment of the town.</P>
        <P>The contractors&rsquo; bids will then have to be evaluated by the council and by the Department in order to select the best all round solution. Each of the bids will be different and the detailed technical assessments that will be needed to select the optimum proposal will take until the end of June. Construction and commissioning will take about 15 months and the new treatment plant should be operational by October 2007.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to see the people of Ennis living under the threat of &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notices in the meantime. In that regard, Clare County Council has advised my Department that it is investigating the availability of temporary treatment facilities. My Department will provide any help we can to the council with interim remedial measures. I also understand that, in the event of further disruption, the council will look at the provision of tankers to relieve the situation. The current &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notice is expected to be lifted by the weekend.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>A separate scheme, the Ennis water supply augmentation scheme, will provide Ennis with a supplementary water supply from Castlelake, and is approved for construction in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme. The department has already approved Clare County Council&rsquo;s proposals to lay some of the pipes for this scheme, at an estimated cost of &euro;5.34 million, in conjunction with the Ennis bypass.</P><Col N="192"/>
        <P>I am acutely conscious of the present highly unsatisfactory situation regarding the Ennis water supply. The Department is helping the council to bring about the earliest possible solution. We maintain close contact with the council and will be available at all times to offer whatever assistance and advice we can.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 152 together.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, I made regulations, the Road Traffic (Speed Limit &mdash; Traffic Signs) Regulations 2005, S.I. No. 10 of 2005, prescribing the regulatory traffic signs displaying metric units of measurement, km/h, that the road authorities must provide on public roads to indicate the speed limit in force. This range of traffic signs can be deployed to indicate that a default speed limit, a special speed limit or a road works speed limit is in force.</P>
        <P>While proposals for new formats of traffic signs are examined from time to time in my Department, the traffic sign regulations that I made in January of this year and the range of sign options already available for use since 20 January 2005 under those regulations are adequate to support the implementation of any special speed limit options. The actual provision and installation of traffic signs on public roads is a matter for each road authority and advice is set out in the traffic signs manual in this regard. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>In March 2002, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, was given statutory responsibility for the delivery of a multi-operator system of integrated ticketing. The proposed contactless smart card based integrated ticketing system will enable a customer to use a ticket on one or more scheduled public transport services, by road and by rail, irrespective of the transport operator involved. In line with international experience, the system is being introduced on a phased basis, initially in the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>In April 2004 a private operator, Mortons Coaches, in conjunction with the RPA and as a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo;, successfully launched smart cards on its services. Last March, another step was taken with the launch of smart cards on Luas services. The Luas smart card deployment is helping to obtain important feedback from passengers and provide operational experience for the next stage of integrated ticketing. Approximately 1,000 smart cards are in use on Mortons Coaches and some 9,000 smart cards are currently in use on Luas services.</P>
        <P>Following an inconclusive procurement procedure earlier this year for the selection of an integrated ticketing provider and operator, the RPA commenced work on a revised procurement strategy and has submitted a draft to my Department. The finalisation of that procurement strategy is being assisted by an informal tripartite group representing the RPA, Dublin Bus and my Department. The work of the group will assist the RPA in determining a revised target implementation date.</P>
        <P>The project budget for integrated ticketing, covering initial implementation in the Dublin area, was set in 2002 at &euro;29.6 million. Arising from the inconclusive procurement procedure, this year&rsquo;s budget allocation was revised from &euro;15 million to &euro;7.5 million. The project budget will be reviewed when considering the revised procurement strategy.</P>
        <P>To date, &euro;8.536 million of Exchequer funds has been spent on integrated ticketing since the RPA was appointed to undertake the project in March 2002. This is comprised of: &euro;349,000 on project appraisal and related activities; &euro;3.615 million on the national design of integrated ticketing, including the proof of concept with Mortons, public consultation and related activities; &euro;4.572 million on procurement, incorporating the Luas smart card deployment, adapting systems to facilitate use by multiple operators and related activities.</P><Col N="195"/>
        <P>I believe that the RPA is correct in taking a prudent approach to the implementation of this complex project using new technology. International experience has shown that successful delivery of integrated ticketing is achieved by a careful, phased introduction with full co-operation from all public transport operators.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 106, 107, 117, 123, 131, 144, 148 and 163 together.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I am committed to reforming the public transport market to provide opportunities for both public and private companies to deliver increased public services and to ensure the taxpayer and the customer get a high quality of service and best value for money. I also intend to re-organise CIE to provide greater operational autonomy to the operating subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>The bus system is essential to an effective public transport system, with approximately 75% of journeys on public transport being made on bus today. I am committed to providing a regulatory framework which will allow public and private bus companies respond more effectively to the needs of the travelling public. In this regard, I propose to establish an independent national public transport commission to,<i> inter alia</i>, allocate Exchequer subvention for public transport services, both bus and rail, through public service contracts, to license commercial bus services and to regulate fares.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department held extensive consultations with the management of CIE, private bus companies and the CIE unions on how best to give effect to the reform of the market. My officials have met with union representatives on 12 occasions since March this year and held a similar number of meetings with each of the other stakeholders. I have sought the views of stakeholders on how, in a pragmatic manner, greater <Col N="197"/>competition can be introduced into the bus market. I am currently considering the views and issues put to me by the various stakeholders and I hope to publish legislation in that regard in the New Year.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to delivering a sustainable transport system designed in a way which will achieve a balance between economic, social and environmental needs. In the current climate of rising oil prices and growing CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> emissions from transport there is clearly a need to focus on cleaner and renewable fuel sources such as biofuel to support the achievement of a sustainable transport system.</P>
        <P>In recognition of this, my Department actively supports the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with regard to its responsibilities in the development and promotion of a biofuels market in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector. My Department participates in the interdepartmental biofuels group, which was established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in 2004 to consider policy options for the development of a biofuels market. The group also comprises representatives from the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Agriculture and Food, and from Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of its work, the group commissioned a Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland, which was published in December 2004. The report explores a range of options and potential supports for biofuels development in Ireland. As a follow up to this report, further work is ongoing with regard to developing measures to increase long-term market penetration of biofuels in the transport fuel market.</P>
        <P>My Department also supports the scheme for mineral oil tax relief on biofuels which was agreed between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Finance and launched in April 2005. Under this scheme, excise relief of &euro;6 million will be allowed for a total of eight projects, involving 16 million litres of biofuel, over a two year period to 2007. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development and I understand that the scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels is being explored by the Departments directly involved. This is something which I would support. Sustainable Energy Ireland also provides funding for biofuels demonstration projects, compatible with its remit in advancing the development of renewable energy.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>My own Department is also engaging with the public transport and road haulage sectors with a view to promoting the increased use of alternative fuels. I understand that CIE is investigating the use of biofuels and hybrid-electric/diesel buses. My Department will actively liaise with it in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 98 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>The Government Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003 period. Achievement of the target would result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is an ambitious target and one which will require the continued commitment to a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we have seen a greater number of road deaths in 2004 than in the previous year when we experienced the lowest number of road deaths in 40 years at 335. The provisional end of year figures for 2004 shows 374 deaths on the roads. This is, however, the second lowest annual road fatality total since 1998, which was the first year for the operation of the first road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>So far this year we have seen an increase in the number of road deaths, with 312 deaths on the roads as at 17 October compared to 298 for the same date last year. The recent increase in road deaths is a cause of concern and places the challenge of meeting the target set for the end of 2006 into stark focus. If we are to realise that target, a significant reversal of the worrying trend that has been noticeable both in early 2004 and over the past number of weeks must be achieved.</P>
        <P>Achievement of the target depends in the first instance on a continued emphasis on the approach that underpins the strategy. A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing remains the correct approach and these remain the key areas of the new strategy.</P>
        <P>The strategy was developed by the high level group on road safety which is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Health and Children, the Garda, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the County and City Managers Association and the Irish Insurance Federation. The agencies and Departments represented on the high level group on road safety are responsible for implementing specific measures in the strategy which are within the remit of each organisation.</P>
        <P>Significant initiatives identified in the strategy that have been realised to date include the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits through the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and the establishment of the new Garda traffic corps. The new speed limits structure featured a reduction in the speed limit in all rural, regional and local roads from 60 miles per hours to 80 kilometers per hour, which equates to 50 miles per <Col N="200"/>hour. The establishment of the dedicated traffic corps last year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under a distinct management structure under the command of an assistant commissioner addresses a particular commitment given by the Government. The corps, when it is fully staffed, will provide the basis for the achievement of the significant gains in road safety that emanate from consistent high levels of traffic law enforcement.</P>
        <P>Other major proposals identified in the strategy, such as the plans to establish a system of private sector operation of speed cameras under the auspices of the Garda and the further extension of the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems, are being advanced and the question of the introduction of a more general basis for the carrying out of preliminary roadside alcohol testing of drivers is being considered. We are making progress across the wide range of initiatives identified in the strategy and I am satisfied that all of the agencies involved are fully committed to the achievement of the goals that underpin the strategy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 143 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the Clare Street initiative, CSI, is to progress the effective implementation of traffic management and related measures in the greater Dublin area and to bring added value to the major transport investments that are under way and planned. During workshops in Clontarf Castle on 5 October, the CSI group considered 37 projects, submitted in advance of the meeting, and distilled from that list a recommended shortlist of 15 priority projects, in some cases involving an amalgamation of separately tabled proposals. The CSI charter makes it clear that the initiative will work with existing agencies and within existing governance structures and that it will be the responsibility of the relevant statutory, or other, agencies to decide whether to proceed with projects suggested by the initiative. I will publish details of the recommended projects once the written conclusions of the Clontarf Castle session have been cleared by CSI members and the <Col N="201"/>implementing agencies have been formally requested to progress these projects.</P>
        <P>I can, however, tell the Deputies that projects fall within the following implementation timescales: short &mdash; within six months; medium &mdash; within one year; long &mdash; within two years. It will be the role of the CSI to promote and support the implementation of projects but not in any way to substitute itself for existing agencies or to pre-empt their functions. Projects under the CSI will be funded from within the Department of Transport&rsquo;s medium term capital envelope and from the resources of implementing agencies, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The CSI will meet again in plenary session in six months. In the meantime, project sponsors will report on project progress on a three monthly basis and will, if they wish, convene sub-groups to advance projects. The initiative, through the relevant project sponsor, will monitor progress on projects and there will be a report on progress at each annual meeting of the CSI&rsquo;s steering group. Having considered the report, the group will decide whether to keep the project on its action list.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers to new EU guidelines on financing of airports and start up aid to airlines departing from regional airports. The aims of the proposed guidelines are to establish a firm legal framework for agreements between airports and airlines and to increase transparency and to prevent any discrimination in the agreements concluded by regional airports and airlines on start up aid.</P>
        <P>The guidelines will affect the structure and assessment of funding for our regional airports by the Exchequer. There will be more onerous administrative obligations relating to establishing the publicly stated role of individual regional airports and the limiting of Exchequer compensation to an analysis of reasonable costs, relevant revenues and a reasonable profit for discharging <Col N="206"/>that publicly stated role. The financial compensation must be based on a transparent accounting system. Proposals for Exchequer investment in general airport infrastructure would have to be in accordance with a clearly defined objective such as regional development or accessibility. These proposals will have to be proportional to the objective set and have satisfactory medium term prospects for use, in particular as regards the use of existing infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department and the airports will have to guard against any infringement of rules for start up aid to airlines. Restrictive conditions will apply to start up aid to airlines for new routes.</P>
        <P>My Department is now examining the proposed new framework required for the regional airport grant schemes in the light of the guidelines. In the light of the importance of regional airport services, my Department will consult with the State and regional airports authorities on the implications of the guidelines and the optimum approach to compliance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 129, 137, 153 and 233 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy for 2005-2007 sets out my broad aviation policy objectives. This policy is underpinned by the State Airports Act 2004, which provides a framework for the restructuring of the three airports and the more recent Government decision in May of this year concerning the provision of new terminal capacity at Dublin Airport. I do not envisage publishing additional policy guidance for Dublin Airport at present.</P>
        <P>I have addressed the position relating to the business planning process in my earlier reply today to the priority question on this matter.</P>
        <P>Passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is forecast to grow to in excess of 18 million passengers this year and to 30 million by around 2015. New infrastructural capacity and facilities, both airside and landside, including further terminal and runway capacity, must be provided in a timely and cost effective manner to cater for this growth. Following consultation with airlines, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, recently announced its medium term plans for new infrastructural provision at Dublin Airport, including a <Col N="208"/>new second terminal and other related developments.</P>
        <P>Under that plan the new terminal, terminal 2, and its associated pier facilities, pier E, which will cater for both short and long haul traffic, will be provided to the south of the existing terminal and will come on stream in 2009. The plan also envisaged that other capacity enhancements, including the provision of temporary pier facilities in 2006 and a permanent new pier, pier D, will be provided by late 2007. These new pier facilities would deliver significant additional aircraft contact stands for fast turnaround operations. The programme also includes the optimisation of the existing terminal, including a northward extension of that building.</P>
        <P>The final specifications and costings of terminal 2 will be independently verified by experts on behalf of the Government, as decided by the latter in May of this year. Also, at the appropriate time, an independent body will conduct an open tender competition to select an operator for the new terminal.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed new runway at Dublin Airport, the DAA submitted its application for planning permission for the new runway to Fingal County Council in December last and that application is currently being processed by the planning authority. The DAA has estimated the cost of the proposed new runway at approximately &euro;150 million. I am informed by the Dublin Airport Authority that the planning authority recently sought further clarification from the company on its planning application for the new runway, including information on forecast growth in passengers and aircraft movements and on a number of surface transport access issues.</P>
        <P>It will also be a matter for the planning authorities to consider surface access issues when they consider, in due course, the DAA&rsquo;s planning applications for the new terminal and pier facilities at Dublin Airport. Proposals for a metro which would serve Dublin Airport are also being considered by my Department as part of its preparatory work on a ten year transport investment framework. I hope to bring proposals on the framework to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>The strategic development of our State Airports, including Dublin Airport, is essential to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, industry and tourism. It is vital that we ensure that the potential for any new bottlenecks to emerge in our strategic national transportation infrastructure is avoided through the provision of timely and cost effective facilities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 251 together.</P>
        <P>On 3 October 2005, CIE lodged an application for a railway order with me under the provisions of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 for a major programme of works to upgrade the infrastructure on the Kildare route, which will lead to a significant increase in capacity. Under the requirements of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, I have now directed that a public inquiry be held into the proposed works and I am in the process of appointing an inspector to hold the inquiry. It is a matter for the inspector to decide when and where the inquiry will be held.</P>
        <P>In deciding, in due course, whether to grant the railway order for the proposed development, I will consider the application itself, the draft railway order from CIE, the inspector&rsquo;s report of the public inquiry and any submissions made to me on the proposal. The timetable for the implementation of the project is dependent on CIE being granted the railway order for which it recently applied.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>For the first three quarters of 2005 this Department has spent &euro;1,060 million, which is &euro;106 million less than profiled for the same period. This difference consists of &euro;92 million less in capital spend and &euro;14 million less in current expenditure.</P>
        <P>The capital difference in the main is made up of a capital spend of &euro;64 million less on roads projects, B2, and &euro;27 million less on public transport projects, C5. This reflects the challenges associated with managing a complex multi-annual capital programme to deliver projects within the budget for a given year. It is mainly timing issues which are arising and the delivery agencies <Col N="210"/>remain in a position to spend their full envelope allocations in aggregate over 2005-06.</P>
        <P>Some specific contributory factors to the lower draw down in the first three quarters of 2005 were competitive tender pricing, planning delays, land acquisition and timing issues on the purchase of rolling stock. The arrangements for a multi-annual capital envelope are specifically designed to provide flexibility to deal with issues of this nature.</P>
        <P>The main current expenditure difference consists of a spend of &euro;14 million less on CIE public service provision payments, C1, due mainly to timing issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>I am keen to facilitate the implementation of park and ride, particularly because of the key part it plays in promoting a more integrated approach to public transport, thereby attracting customer patronage. I am also acutely aware of the need to develop appropriate park and ride facilities in tandem with wider public transport development projects, such as the expansion of suburban commuter rail services. Bearing this in mind, this summer I approved the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s strategy for rail based park and ride but I also stipulated that I would not rule out bus based park and ride.</P>
        <P>My Department is now open to considering applications for Exchequer capital grants in respect of suitable park and ride facilities. I am, therefore, delighted to confirm that capital funding may also be made available for bus based park and ride projects on a pilot basis. The level of grant assistance will be determined having regard to the strength of the business case and having regard to the relative priority accorded to <Col N="211"/>the particular project in the context of the DTO&rsquo;s transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area. My Department will not fund ongoing operational costs of park and ride activities.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council, which has responsibility for traffic management, has developed a HGV management strategy, which will be implemented to coincide with the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel. The council is currently finalising the operational details of the proposed strategy and developing a detailed implementation plan. The objectives of the strategy are to ensure the optimal use of the port tunnel by HGVs, to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city and to manage the movement of outsize vehicles, for example, through permit systems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, I should point out that the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s A Platform for Change  provides a transport planning framework for the development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area up to 2016. The DTO strategy takes account of the requirement for integration and co-ordination in traffic management and makes provision for modal interchanges and park and ride.</P>

	<P>The question of the adoption of changes in the circumstances where the driver of a vehicle can be made the subject of a preliminary roadside breath test <Col N="212"/>has been the subject of considerable debate and consideration for some time. The first Government road safety strategy, which related to the period 1998 to 2002, indicated that while the Government would consider the possibility of some change to the position that prevailed in advance of the publication of that strategy, it did not envisage the adoption of the unqualified application of random breath testing by the end of the period in question. Subsequently the Road Traffic Acts were amended to provide that the garda&iacute; are now empowered to require that all drivers involved in road collisions or detected committing any traffic offences must submit to roadside breath tests. This is in addition to the power to demand that a driver who in the opinion of a garda has consumed alcohol must submit to such a test.</P>
        <P>The current road safety strategy recommends that the introduction of random breath testing should be pursued within its operational time frame of 2004 to 2006. Against that background my Department is examining the development of a scheme for a more general basis for roadside testing in close consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. My officials will continue to engage with that office to determine the most appropriate sustainable basis for broadening the current operational framework for preliminary roadside breath testing.</P>

	<P>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. The regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists also. <Col N="213"/>Having regard to the role of taxis in providing an on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
        <P>Many requests have been received by my Department seeking to extend access to bus lanes to a wide range of other road users, including hackney and limousine operators, motorcyclists and drivers of cars with more than two occupants. A review of the access issue was carried out in 2001 and took account of the physical characteristics of the vehicles seeking access, including motorcycles. As part of that review the views of the director of traffic in Dublin City Council, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were sought. All of those bodies suggested that there should be no change to the current position. That remains the position.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to a similar question from Deputy Pat Breen on 4 October 2005, which I answered along with a question from Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan. As I have said previously, I do not believe an impact study of the kind proposed is required. The restructuring of the State Airports, including Shannon, is intended to enhance their regional focus and I am encouraged by the close co-operation between <Col N="214"/>the new Shannon Airport Authority and the other regional development bodies in the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Work under way in my Department on a ten year transport investment framework will address the future infrastructural requirements of the mid-west region. The restructuring of the State Airports, including Shannon, will be progressed in the light of the assessment in due course, by both myself and the Minister for Finance, of the business plans which are currently under preparation by the three airport authorities. The development of an EU-US open skies regime provides many opportunities for Shannon Airport to contribute to the development of the mid-west. The liberalisation of the aviation market between the EU and US will mean more, not fewer, opportunities for Shannon to develop new routes into North America.</P>
        <P>Finally, it has been the consistent policy of this Government that any change in transatlantic arrangements will be accompanied by an appropriate transitional arrangement to enable a smooth phasing in of open skies with the US in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 159 together.</P>
        <P>Automated toll collection is currently in use on existing toll plazas and will be used on all future toll schemes. Automated toll collection does not require legislation for its use. The automated toll collection systems currently in place, however, use a barrier as the main enforcement tool as toll operators do not consider the existing legislative arrangements robust enough to support a move to open road tolling.</P>
        <P>Open road tolling, that is the collection of tolls by automated means in a barrier free environment, is, I consider, the optimal means of toll collection where the traffic volumes and toll revenues justify the investment required. My Department is, therefore, working on proposals for legislative amendments to strengthen the enforcement provisions relating to non-payment of tolls in an open road environment. I anticipate, subject to the other priorities on the legislative programme, that the draft legislation will be introduced early next year.</P>
        <P>I assume that the difficulties the Deputy is referring to relate to the temporary layout changes implemented at the West Link plaza which provided for a second dedicated automated collection lane in each direction. I understand that the second lane was introduced as part of a campaign to encourage the migration to automated tolling in preparation for the progression of the West Link to a fully free flow automated toll collection system. The transition from the <Col N="216"/>current toll collection arrangements to a non-stop automated toll collection facility is planned to be implemented over a number of stages involving a phased reduction in the cashier or coin basket lanes with a corresponding increase in automated toll payments with the objective that the free flow arrangements will be in place to coincide with the completion of the M50 upgrade works.</P>
        <P>However, I understand that the removal of the basket lane to provide the second automated lane had an adverse effect on traffic flow through the West Link plaza and NTR withdrew the second automated lane on 29 August 2005. The evidence from the unsuccessful attempt to convert to a second dedicated automated lane in each direction highlights one of the many challenges that lie ahead in migrating the West Link toll facility from its present predominantly cash payment configuration to a fully free flow automated toll collection system. It is anticipated that as the uptake of Eazypass increases, the introduction of a second automated lane will prove to be viable.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 154 together.</P>
        <P>The meeting of the Transport Council on 6 October 2005 unanimously agreed with the European Commission that the time was now right for the resumption of negotiations with the US. The previous talks had ended in a failure to reach agreement in June 2004. The main issues where agreement could not be reached were market access, ownership and control issues, and issues such as state aid and security.</P>
        <P>However, since then, both sides have maintained contact at official level and have explored ideas that could lead to the reopening of official negotiations. The European Commissioner dealing with transport, Mr. Jacques Barrot, indicated that the US is considering unilateral moves on ownership and control, outside of the EU-US process, and that this could lead to movement in other areas and could bring about a real chance for success. Formal negotiations recommenced on 17 October 2005 in Brussels and Ireland has a <Col N="217"/>representative at those discussions. Another session is planned for Washington in November, with a view to bringing an agreement to the Transport Council on 5 December 2005 for approval.</P>
        <P>As I have made clear to the House on many occasions, it is my clear intention that any such agreement will include an appropriate transitional arrangement for Shannon Airport to be agreed between Ireland and the US in the lead up to the conclusion of the EU-US deal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 132, 134 and 136 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current five-year investment envelope for transport provides for capital expenditure of &euro;10.15 billion over the 2005-09 period. I cannot comment on the level of funding to be made available for the ten-year transport investment framework until the Government has considered the matter. I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The estimated overall funding requirement to implement the framework is based on the work carried out by the agencies and my Department to date. To identify the broad direction and priorities under the transport investment framework, my Department engaged with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office. The new framework will also take account of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the national road needs study, and of other proposals such as <Col N="219"/>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s greater Dublin integrated rail network plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The framework will, of course, build on the work already completed or under way under the transport element of the current national development plan. Key transport priorities under the current NDP, such as the completion of the motorways linking Dublin to the provincial cities, will be provided for as part of the new framework.</P>
        <P>In developing the framework, my Department asked the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, to carry out transportation modelling on the impacts of a number of different scenarios to help assess the optimal mix of investments. Projects which are already committed to or are part completed, and which are likely to form part of the draft framework, were of course included in this exercise, in order to give a view of the overall impact of the proposed integrated transport network on traffic and travel behaviour. The draft framework is currently being finalised and is expected to be considered by Government shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The tendering process has been completed and a preferred tenderer has been selected. However, the use of outsourcing as part of a package of measures to clear the backlog of driving test applications is being disputed by the staff associations, who have asked that the matter be referred to conciliation under the terms of Sustaining Progress. A conciliation hearing at the Labour Relations Commission is scheduled for 21 October 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 130 and 162 together.</P>
        <P>It is my policy that Irish Rail should remain in the rail freight business. The strategic rail review, commissioned by my Department and published in 2003, contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to a sustainable environment. The Irish Rail business plan was developed against the background of the options contained in the strategic rail review, using a strategy with regard to freight which is to: break even by 2006; increase the profitability of the existing profitable business; withdraw from those businesses that are heavily loss making; target trainload container traffic.</P>
        <P>In formulating this plan, Irish Rail held wide ranging consultations with business interests around the country to identify those freight activities which are best suited to rail transport. <Col N="222"/>In delivering this strategy the company has made good progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, such as in the carriage of sugar beet, cement and pulpwood. Irish Rail continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present. However, as in all businesses, it must adjust the freight business from time to time to reflect changes in the market place.</P>
        <P>It remains my priority that any additional Exchequer subvention should focus on expanding passenger services to meet the continuing unmet demand for such services, in seeking to address the adverse social and economic impacts caused by traffic congestion.</P>
        <P>As I stated in the Dail on a previous occasion, in accordance with Directive 2004/51/EC the market for international rail freight services will be opened from 1 January 2006. This will enable any railway undertaking established in the EU, whether publicly or privately owned, to provide international freight services on the existing Irish rail network. From 1 January 2007, the domestic freight market will be opened. Under the proposed arrangements CIE, as the owner of the rail network, will be entitled to recoup the costs associated with allowing access to its network. In preparation for market opening, my Department is open to discussions with any interested operator.</P>
        <P>My Department has received a recent communication from an international operator outlining its intentions to seek to carry out freight operations in the Irish freight market.</P>

	<P>My Department and the Department of Finance agreed a package of measure to reduce the backlog of driving test applications in April this year. The package includes a bonus scheme for driver testers, the recruitment of additional testers as well as the outsourcing of a block of tests. Details of the package were notified to the testers&rsquo; union, IMPACT, in late April 2005 and to other unions in May 2005. Consultations on the package commenced shortly afterwards with IMPACT.</P>
        <P>The tendering process for a contract to conduct driving tests commenced in June 2005. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 5 September 2005. Although the position was outlined at departmental council, detailed consultation with staff, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 21.12 of Sustaining Progress, on the effect such outsourcing might have on their work could not proceed until such time as the details of the preferred tender were available. My officials have already had preliminary meetings with two of the staff associations in this context.</P>
        <P>The purpose of my recent meeting with the staff associations, following a disappointing lack of uptake of a generous bonus scheme offered to driver testers, was to stress my commitment to the package on offer and to offer assurances to the staff that the outsourcing option was a once off response to deal with the unacceptable delays in obtaining a driving test that would not impact on their terms and conditions and was not intended as a precursor to outsourcing of the driver testing service. Regrettably the use of outsourcing is being disputed by the staff associations, who have asked that the matter be referred to conciliation under the terms of Sustaining Progress. A conciliation hearing at the Labour Relations Commission is scheduled for 21 October 2005.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Section 16 of the Road Transport Act 1999 provides for an on-the-spot fine in lieu of prosecution for offences under the Road Transport Acts and EU regulations on drivers&rsquo; hours and rest periods. The commencement of <Col N="224"/>this section has been the subject of discussions with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the advice now is that a new provision in primary legislation will be required to ensure compatability with current fixed penalty charges legislation before this section can be brought into effect. I will take the opportunity to deal with this matter in legislation when a suitable opportunity arises.</P>
        <P>The commencement order to introduce the provisions of sections 4 to 8 of the Road Transport Act 1999, relating to the introduction of the transport disks, came into force on 30 September last. My Department will issue disks to all current licence holders in the coming weeks. Once issued, it shall be illegal for the holder of a road freight carrier&rsquo;s licence, a road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licence or a community licence, to operate a vehicle for hire or reward unless that vehicle is displaying the transport disk issued in respect of the vehicle in question.</P>
        <P>The current date for the compulsory fitting of digital tachographs on all new buses and lorries within the EU is 1 January 2006. However, a deferral of this date is still the subject of discussion between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission.</P>
        <P>My Department will shortly be able to support those companies planning to introduce digital tachographs in advance of the compulsory requirements. I expect to make in the coming weeks the necessary statutory orders for the introduction of the digital technology, including the issue of driver cards, company cards, workshop cards and enforcement cards as required under EU law. The necessary technical arrangements for this are now in place. Once the necessary orders are made, the Department will commence the issue of such cards as the demand arises from the industry.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to support existing buses and lorries using analogue tachographs until analogue technology is phased out over the coming years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>In the context of a review of the West Link bridge agreement, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General discovered an underpayment in the licence fee due to the State under the West Link bridge agreement in respect of the years 2002 and 2003.</P>
        <P>The background to the underpayment is that under the West Link bridge agreement, a licence fee, also referred to as the State&rsquo;s share of the gross toll revenue, is payable to the Exchequer. For the years 2002 and 2003, and in the context of the introduction of VAT on tolls, a credit was negotiated as part of the agreement relating to the second West Link bridge, whereby NTR would be repaid the cost of not increasing toll levels through a reduction in the licence fee payable. This credit should have been added to the gross toll revenue, GTR, before calculating the licence fee in accordance with the definition of GTR included in the 2001 supplemental agreement. This was not done by NTR and was not picked up by NTR&rsquo;s auditor KPMG, the National Roads Authority, NRA, or the Department. The checking arrangements in place in the Department had not been adjusted to take account of this definition of GTR included in the 2001 supplemental agreement. The effect of not including <Col N="226"/>the credit as part of the GTR was to understate the amount payable to the State.</P>
        <P>As soon as the underpayment was discovered in July 2005, the matter was immediately taken up with NTR, through the NRA as party to the West Link bridge agreement. NTR reviewed the calculation of the licence fee payment in respect of 2002 and 2003 and accepted that an underpayment occurred which was calculated as &euro;1,863,236. NTR paid this amount to my Department in July together with interest penalties in respect of the late payment amounting to &euro;73,314, that is, a total payment of &euro;1,936,550.</P>
        <P>The error which occurred was related to the special arrangement put in place for a limited period of two years and which is unlikely to recur. Nevertheless, the procedures for checking and validating the licence fee in NTR, the NRA and within my Department should have prevented the occurrence of the underpayment. A thorough review of those procedures is being finalised.</P>
        <P>The objective of the review is to ensure that the correct licence fee is received by the State in all circumstances.</P>

	<P>Comparisons with the best performing countries in the European Union can be made by examining the number of road deaths per 100,000 population for 2002, the most recent year for which comparisons <Col N="228"/>are available. The road fatality rate in Ireland in 2002 was 9.6 per 100,000 population, which placed Ireland in seventh place among the then 15 member states of the European Union. The best performing countries were the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands. The fatality rates in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Netherlands were 6.1, 6.0 and 6.1 fatalities per 100,000 population, respectively.</P>
        <P>A recent press release issued by the ECMT showed the increase in fatalities in 2004 on 2003 in European and OECD countries. Ireland experienced a 13.1% increase during that period, which was the highest increase amongst western European countries. It should be noted, however, that 2003 saw the lowest number of road deaths in 40 years in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The new Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 outlines a range of issues that it is intended will be pursued over that period. In overall terms, measures will continue to focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and seat belt wearing.</P>
        <P>The primary target of the new Government strategy on road safety is to realise a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the period 1998 to 2003. Achievement of the target will result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. My Department, the other Departments and agencies involved in the pursuit of road safety policies will continue to positively promote initiatives aimed at meeting that demanding target.</P>
        <P>The overall aim of our road safety policy is to bring our record more into line with experience in the better performing states in the European Union. Meeting the target established in the road safety strategy will also assist in the achievement of the longer-term EU target of a 50% reduction in road deaths across the Union by 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The North-South work programme, which was agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North. However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty points systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system <Col N="229"/>that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain. For that reason, it was agreed, early in 2003, that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council, BIC. As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.</P>
        <P>The development of a system of mutual recognition of penalty points presents complex legal questions and will require the negotiation of a bilateral agreement between the two Governments and probably the passage of primary legislation to support such an agreement. For that reason, my Department has sought and obtained the advice of the Office of the Attorney General regarding this issue. It will inform future consideration of the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The improvement and maintenance of national roads is the responsibility of the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the local authorities concerned. The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 obliges landowners and occupiers of land to take all necessary care to ensure that shrubs, hedges or any other vegetation on their land are not or could not become a danger to road users.</P>
        <P>Section 70 also empowers a local authority, where it considers that a hazard exists, to serve a notice on a landowner or occupier of land requiring action to be taken to remove the danger or potential danger. The local authority itself can carry out the works specified in the notice in any case where the person on whom the notice was served fails to comply with it. The authority may also carry out additional works which it considers necessary. Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the local authority can act at once &mdash; without serving notice &mdash; to remove or reduce the danger. In either case, the local authority may recover the cost of the works from the landowner or occupier.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that these powers enable local authorities to take necessary action in respect of roadside obstructions. In addition to the foregoing, I understand that some local authorities undertake hedge cutting as part of their road maintenance activities.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it is practically impossible for a person in a wheelchair to have access to a wheelchair accessible taxi; the way in which this reflects on the commitment given by the Government in 2001 at the point of deregulation of the taxi fleet that from 2003 a process would start whereby all taxis would become wheelchair accessible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29487/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The operation and licensing of wheelchair accessible taxis and their drivers is controlled through the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002. The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 &mdash; SI 47 of 1998 &mdash; set out the vehicle requirements for wheelchair accessible taxis. These regulations also make it clear that a space for a wheelchair and its occupant must be available in a wheelchair accessible taxi at all times while the vehicle is standing and plying for hire. Enforcement of this requirement is the responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>A specific objective of the Commission for Taxi Regulation is to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities. In this regard the commission is tasked with the determination of future policy on accessible taxis.</P>
        <P>The commission has recently completed a public consultation process on the development of a new code for the regulation of small public service vehicles, including wheelchair accessible taxis and their drivers. Following that consultative process, the commission now intends to improve accessibility through new regulations involving improved standards of accessibility, increased availability of accessible vehicles, improved driver awareness and training, and improved information and infrastructure provision. The commission proposes to commence putting these measures in place from 2006 on a phased basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, GHGs. GHGs from the transport sector are comprised almost entirely of carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of petrol and diesel, on which the transport sector is heavily dependent.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy, NCCS, which was published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2000, sets out a broad package of policies and measures aimed at achieving national Kyoto targets, a number of which relate to transport. That Department chairs the interdepartmental climate change team in which my Department actively participates. The team is charged with overseeing the package of measures outlined in the NCCS.</P>
        <P>A number of developments have taken place since the NCCS was adopted, including the commencement of emissions trading and the decision last year not to proceed with the introduction of a carbon tax. In light of these, and wider economic developments that impact on the achievement of emission reductions, the NCCS is currently under review. The adequacy of existing policies and <Col N="236"/>measures, including those in the transport sector, is central to this review.</P>
        <P>My Department is already proactive in pursuing a variety of measures to promote fuel efficiency, modal shift and demand management measures outlined in the NCCS. These include the provision of significantly improved public transport services to encourage modal shift away from the private car and towards public transport. My Department&rsquo;s forthcoming ten year transport investment framework will focus on delivering a substantial improvement in bus and rail services nationally. My Department is also providing significant financial and other support for a range of traffic management initiatives, including bus priority and the provision of facilities for cycling and walking.</P>
        <P>It is recognised internationally that the achievement of emission reductions in the transport sector represents a significant challenge, particularly in the context of the strong economic growth Ireland has experienced in recent years. Nevertheless, in recognition of the contribution of transport to GHGs, my Department is committed to working with the climate change team to examine the scope for the development of additional policies to reduce the level of GHGs from the transport sector in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable way.</P>

	<P>Under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, the regulation of foreign military aircraft is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Under the order the Minister for Foreign Affairs has no obligation to approve any overflights or landings and may impose any conditions that he sees fit. The Minister for Foreign Affairs normally imposes all of the conditions mentioned in the question. Consequently, I do not believe an amendment of the order is necessary to make it a legal requirement for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to impose these restrictions.</P>

	<P>I met with representatives of the Retired Aviation Staff Association most recently on 29 June 2005. Since that meeting, a further actuarial evaluation of the Irish airlines, general employees, superannuation scheme was made available in August 2005. The results of that evaluation showed that without provision for future indexation of pensions, the scheme has a surplus of &euro;140 million. However, if provision is made for future indexation of pensions, the scheme has a potential deficit of &euro;336 million.</P>
        <P>As I have said in the House previously, pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority, are matters primarily for the trustee, the members of the relevant scheme and the company or companies involved. The State is not involved in the funding of these schemes.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that members of the Retired Aviation Staff Association have genuine concerns <Col N="238"/>regarding their pensions. My Department has asked the companies to jointly examine the issues arising in regard to the pension scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 192 together.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General of my Department has brought to the attention of the chief executive officer of the HSE the concerns that he shares with the Department of Finance in regard to IT governance generally within the HSE. The Secretary General met with the HSE and the Department of Finance on 18 October to progress these issues.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is carrying out an examination of the PPARS project, is looking into the <Col N="239"/>specific governance arrangements for that project.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that robust project management and project governance arrangements are in place in the FISP project since its inception. In total, the HSE has deployed a project management structure comprising: a project sponsor, a project director, a national project manager, six national team leaders and two area project managers. In addition, a project board chaired by a CEO of a health board and representative of all key stakeholders led the project during 2003-2004. In 2005, responsibility for the project rests with the HSE director of finance.</P>
        <P>The Government, on 11 October 2005, decided on a new system for the management and control of major ICT projects, and a number of new measures to improve the management of consultancies, and I will be ensuring that these, together with any governance recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s examination, will be rigorously followed in the health sector.</P>
        <P>The private consultant concerned was working as a consultant for the HSE on the FISP project and he contacted my Department about the concerns raised by the Department of Finance about that project. He was informed that my Department only deals with the national director ICT on these matters and that all issues should be dealt with through these channels. The Department of Finance and the national director ICT were also informed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2003, the Minister for Health and Children established a project team to critically examine all options for the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital. Several options, including the option of remaining in Dundrum, were examined under the various criteria, including clinical quality and strategic fit, cost in capital and revenue, timescale, future demands, integrated services, accessibility and safety and security. The team reported to the Department of Health and Children in May 2004 and recommended that the Central Mental Hospital be relocated to a new purpose built facility in the greater Dublin area, as this was judged to be the most appropriate option for delivery of patient care.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided in principle that the new hospital will be developed on the Thornton Hall site, adjacent to the new prison. A total of 97% of admissions to the Central Mental Hospital come from within the Prison Service. The new Central Mental Hospital will be a health facility, providing a therapeutic forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards in a state-of-the-art building. It is intended to develop the Central Mental Hospital independently of the prison complex by means of a separate capital development project, managed and directed by the Health Service Executive. The hospital will not be part of the prison complex but will have its own grounds with a separate entrance, access road and address. It will remain under the aegis of the Department of Health and <Col N="241"/>Children and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>Payments made by my Department to the firm in question during the period 1997 to date, relate solely to work undertaken by the firm in regard to the civil registration modernisation programme. The work undertaken relates primarily to the development of and support for the information technology system required to support the modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme was a programme of work undertaken jointly by my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. One of the main elements of the programme was the development of an information technology system for electronic registration of life events and sharing of <Col N="242"/>registration data. The programme was overseen by a steering committee with representatives from a number of Departments and agencies and was managed by a programme management group which reported to the steering committee.</P>
        <P>The procurement exercise for the appointment of consultants to develop the computer system was undertaken by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I understand that the procurement exercise was carried out in accordance with EU and Department of Finance requirements.</P>
        <P>Moneys in respect of this contract were paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the firm in question during 2001 and 2002, and my Department, as the ultimate owner of the new system, took over responsibility for payments in respect of the contract in 2003. The total amount paid by my Department in 2003 was &euro;1,271,662.40.</P>
        <P>The civil registration information technology system went live in the former Southern Health Board region in late 2003 and was subsequently rolled out to all other former health boards during 2004. The system has brought considerable benefits to members of the public and other Departments and public bodies. The registration of life events and production of certificates is now electronic and the time taken to complete these transactions has been significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>Data are passed electronically from the General Register Office, GRO, to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the purpose of processing claims and payments for child benefit. As a result, the processing time for child benefit applications has been reduced from 20 days to two days. This process is further enhanced by the transfer of births data electronically from maternity hospitals to the GRO, and the electronic allocation of PPS numbers in respect of newly registered births.</P>
        <P>Deaths data are made available to all public bodies through REACH via the inter-agency messaging service. This is of considerable value to public bodies in managing schemes such as medical cards, pensions and so on. Statistical data are also transferred electronically to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and this greatly improves the ability of the CSO to manage, analyse and report such data which are essential for public policy and planning.</P>
        <P>A further contract was subsequently entered into by my Department with the same firm for the provision of support and maintenance and for minor enhancements to the civil registration computer system. This contract was awarded following a competitive tendering process which was carried out in accordance with EU and Department of Finance procurement rules. The contract is for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2005. The amounts paid to date to the firm in question are as follows: in 2004, &euro;560,457.60; and in 2005, &euro;491,219.28.</P><Col N="243"/>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme has been recognised nationally and internationally as an excellent example of best practice in public administration and has received awards from the EU, the European Institute of Public Administration, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Computerworld</i> magazine. I am satisfied that the modernisation programme has resulted in a greatly improved service to the public and to public service organisations and represents value for money.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 182 together.</P>
        <P>In the last year, I have had numerous meetings with many people in my office in Dublin and throughout the country where the development of private facilities on public hospital grounds was raised and discussed, often as part of wide ranging agendas. Among them, I have met consultants and management at Waterford Regional Hospital, consultants at Limerick Regional Hospital and members of the Limerick Hospital Trust, members of the board and management of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, consultants and management at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, the promoters of the Beacon Clinic and Hospital, and representatives of the management of the Mater Private Hospital.</P>
        <P>Since the issue has often been raised in the context of other discussions, it is not feasible to look back through all meetings and occasions where discussions might have taken place or advice or information was offered.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that, following the publication of the Pollock report, commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, the Health Service Executive established a multi-disciplinary working group to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland. The working group is also to make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services. I understand that the work of the group is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>With regard to the services for cystic fibrosis patients at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, I understand that the HSE has recently made additional funding available to the hospital to implement short-term measures to alleviate some of the pressures, including the provision of additional staff and additional space. Finally, I have arranged to meet with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association towards the end of this month to discuss the future needs of persons with cystic fibrosis.</P>

	<P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in 2000 and covers the eastern, north-eastern, midland and part of the south-eastern regions of the country. The roll out of the national breast screening programme to the remaining regions in the country is a major priority in the development of cancer services.</P>
        <P>A design team has been appointed to work up detailed plans for two new BreastCheck clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork, and one at University College Hospital, Galway. It is anticipated that, subject to obtaining satisfactory planning approval, the design process, including the preparation of the tender documentation, will be completed by mid-2006. Approximately &euro;21 million capital funding has been made available and my Department is in discussions with BreastCheck about the revenue requirements for the programme.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 45,000 women in the target population for screening in counties Cork and Kerry and it is expected that screening will commence in these counties in 2007. The national expansion of the programme will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group in every county have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where appropriate.</P><Col N="248"/>
        <P>Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>A total of 11 management advisory committee-chief executive officer group meetings were held over the three year period 2002 to 2004 <Col N="251"/>inclusive. In 2002, management advisory committee &mdash; chief executive officer group meetings were held on 26 February, 24 April, 26 June, 25 September, 19 November and 18 December. In 2003, management advisory committee-chief executive officer group meetings were held on 26 February and 16 December. In 2004 management advisory committee-chief executive officer group meetings were held on 29 March and 18 October.</P>
        <P>The minutes of these management advisory committee-chief executive officer group meetings indicate that the following elements of the capital programme were discussed at the following meetings: 18 October 2004, ICT and minor capital were identified as priorities as well as revenue implications and employment control ceilings; 29 March 2004, it was stated that the Department was in discussions with the Department of Finance about the capital investment needs for the 2004 to 2008 period, and priorities were a clear 2004 programme with a substantial increase in ICT over that period and the minor capital programme for 2004.</P>
        <P>On 18 December 2002 it was agreed that a minor capital programme was a high priority, if funding allowed, in 2003. On 19 November 2002 it was agreed that it would be possible only to go ahead with existing contracts under the national development plan and that there may not be any money for a minor capital equipment replacement programme. On 25 September 2002 the Department indicated that a key objective of the national development plan was to bring parity between the acute and non-acute spend by the end of 2006. Replacement equipment in the acute sector and health and safety in the non-acute sector would be a priority in the coming year. Work on public private partnership was briefly referred to.</P>
        <P>On 24 April 2002 the chief executive officers noted their concern over the lack of funding for equipment in the national development plan and agreed that there was a need to take stock of equipment in 2003 and to organise a new equipment programme.</P>
        <P>On 26 February 2002 it was indicated that the national development plan was progressing against a background of high inflation and this was reducing the scale of work that could be carried out. Work was continuing on projects for which there were contractual commitments. The need for a balance between the spend on acute and non-acute sector projects was noted. There was discussion around public private partnerships and the need for any new model to show clear benefits before any pilot.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officers highlighted the need to address health and safety capital issues, equipment and ICT systems as most national development plan allocation now proved inadequate to address these needs.</P>

	<P>In recent years, provision has been made under the indicative drugs target savings scheme for the development of a primary care website, <i>myGP.ie</i>, which is operated by the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, with the aim of answering patients&rsquo; queries and disseminating non-biased and comprehensive information on primary and preventative health care.</P>
        <P>This is consistent with the overall objectives of the scheme which are to encourage rational prescribing practices on the part of general practitioners, increase and enhance the information and services available to patients and, in return, allow GPs to access funds for approved practice developments, research and education, and additional primary care expertise at practice level.</P>
        <P>Funding for the <i>myGP.ie</i> website has been made available from within the overall budget for the scheme, which was provided for in the Vote for my Department up to this year. Payments to the IMO for development and maintenance costs commenced in May 2000 and amounted to <Col N="253"/>approximately &euro;996,000 in the period to end-2001, approximately &euro;375,000 in 2002 and &euro;660,000 in 2004. No payments have been made in 2005. The <i>myGP.ie </i>website was launched in 2004 and has been fully operational since then.</P>
        <P>The review of governance and accountability mechanisms in the general medical service, published by my Department in February 2005, raised concerns regarding the liability to the Exchequer arising from the operation of the scheme in its present form. In this light, and in line with my commitment to the ongoing review of the operation of the general medical service and community drugs schemes, my Department and the Health Service Executive together with the IMO have initiated a full review of the scheme, which will take place over the coming months and will encompass all of its aspects. The outcome of this review will inform the way forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that smoking prevalence and particularly smoking by young persons is tackled in a comprehensive manner. This includes legislation, regulation, health promotion and education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national health and lifestyle survey, Sl&aacute;n, published in 1999 revealed a worrying trend in that 36% of teenage girls in the 15 to 17 year old age group smoked. This figure exceeded that of young boys in the same age group which stood at <Col N="254"/>30%. In response to this trend the health promotion unit of my Department launched a campaign specifically aimed at young women.</P>
        <P>The campaign, entitled &ldquo;Nico&rdquo;, concentrated on issues which are more immediately important to young women, such as their appearance. The simple message of this campaign is that smokers are less attractive and it used a range of &lsquo;anti-cosmetics&rsquo; presented by a character called Nico. The Nico campaign used TV, radio and outdoor advertising. The advertisement was evaluated and achieved unprecedented recognition and awareness scores amongst the smoking population.</P>
        <P>A second advertisement, &ldquo;Nico&rsquo;s crib&rdquo;, was developed and launched in 2004 and is aimed at young people in general. The advertisement is based on the MTV hit programme called &ldquo;Cribs&rdquo; which is popular with young viewers. The advertisement has been broadcast primarily in cinemas and was supported by TV bursts and a promotional campaign.</P>
        <P>The 2002 Sl&aacute;n results were published in 2003. Nationally smoking prevalence has decreased from 31% to 27%. Numbers of those in the 12 to 14 year old age group showed a sharp decrease in smoking prevalence, a critical point for intervention to prevent initiation. Numbers of young women in the 15 to 17 year old age group have also decreased by almost 5% and young men in the same age group have decreased slightly.</P>
        <P>The tobacco free policy review group was set up to carry out a fundamental review of health and tobacco and make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children. Its report, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, which was adopted as Government policy, proposed an integrated strategy for tackling the tobacco problem and promoting a tobacco free society. The report outlines four key strategic objectives: to change attitudes; to help people give up smoking; to protect people from passive smoke; and to focus on children. The establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control is one of the measures put forward in the report. The office received statutory status in May 2002, with the enactment of section 2 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.</P>
        <P>In response to an Office of Tobacco Control report which documented the dangers of passive smoke, the Minister for Health and Children announced a prohibition on smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises, with effect from 29 March 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The &ldquo;Every Cigarette is Doing You Damage&rdquo; media campaign, together with the introduction of the ban on smoking in the workplace, increased the demand for smoking cessation services both nationally and regionally. The national smokers&rsquo; quitline and media campaign were launched on 30 October 2003. To date 34,500 callers have used the quitline. Half of the callers have received the quitting booklet, which contains tips and information to encourage smokers to quit. People under 30 account for almost 30% of the callers who contact the quitline.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>In a recent survey 71% of clients who had quit stated that the national smokers&rsquo; quitline was an important aspect of or significant help in keeping them off cigarettes. Similarly 60% stated that the workplace ban was an important aspect of or significant help in keeping them off cigarettes.</P>
        <P>The cardiovascular strategy recommended that an annual module on smoking should be included in the social personal and health education programme, SPHE, in schools. Smoking is included in a SPHE module, which also addresses alcohol and drugs. The aim of the SPHE programme is to educate and empower young people to make good health and lifestyle choices. An evaluation of the programme highlighted the need to update the SPHE modules in response to the evolving requirements of schoolchildren, who now need more information at a younger age.</P>
        <P>A recent survey from the Office of Tobacco Control revealed that the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking in Ireland was 23.6% at August 2005. This represents a decline of 1.52% since August 2003.</P>
        <P>The survey also revealed that almost 18% of 15 to 18 year olds report as being smokers with 19 to 35 years olds being the dominant category with over 30% of people in that age group classified as smokers. While these statistics are encouraging my Department will strive to reduce these figures further by continuing to discourage young people from starting smoking and ensuring that adequate information and support is available for those wishing to quit.</P>

The conclusions reached in this study were used to develop a Presidency document under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU entitled &ldquo;Key Principles of an Interoperability Architecture&rdquo; which is published on both the REACH and EU Public Administration Network websites.

	<P>I have no role in the valuation of properties, which is the function of the Valuation Office. However, I am informed by the Valuation Office that an application was received from Kildare County Council on 14 June 2005 under the 1995 tenant purchase scheme in respect of a local authority house at Kilcock, County Kildare. The tenants are disputing the council&rsquo;s valuation on the premises and the Valuation Office has been asked to adjudicate on the matter.</P>
        <P>On inquiry about progress in this case, I understand that there is some delay in dealing with casework of this nature because office resources are concentrated on the revision of rateable valuations which the Valuation Office is required to carry out by statute. However, I am assured that the case will be prioritised and assigned to a valuer this month for inspection, after which a decision on the valuation will be reported to Kildare County Council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
        <P>The State has invested some &euro;80 million in building and equipping new world class laboratory facilities for the State Laboratory at Backweston. With the completion of the move the State Laboratory is now better placed to deliver an enhanced analytical service for its clients. Inevitably, during the period of the actual move there was some temporary disruption to <Col N="259"/>services. However, I am assured by the laboratory management that turn around times are now back to previous levels and are continuing to improve.</P>
        <P>Additional resources have been allocated over the years to the State Laboratory. Additionally, my Department has recently sanctioned the permanent retention of six temporary posts associated with the move of the laboratory to Backweston. It is worth pointing out the significant increase in the number of samples being sent to the State Laboratory and a general increase in the complexity of the analyses now being undertaken. Nevertheless, as a result of improvement in procedures and additional resources, laboratory management has managed to reduce turnaround times by half during the period April 2004 to April 2005.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the importance of the service provided to the coroners by the State Laboratory and the impact it inevitably has on relatives of people whose deaths are the subject of inquests at a time of great distress. The management of the laboratory shares that sensitivity and constantly monitors the service by reviewing available resources, outsourcing possibilities and the complexity of analyses.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the State Laboratory is expected to receive today the samples referred to for analysis. I understand that relevant analyses will be carried out at an early date and reports issued accordingly.</P>

        <Quest>if he is satisfied that the present thresholds that apply under capital acquisitions tax for transfer to persons who are not sons or daughters of deceased persons are set at a realistic level in view of the fact that the present market value of an average house represents over six times the threshold for transfer to a brother or sister and over 12 times the threshold for the transfer to a person who is unrelated; his estimate of the cost of doubling these two thresholds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29620/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>For the purpose of capital acquisitions tax, CAT, the relationship between the person who provided a gift or inheritance, the disponer, and the person who received a gift or inheritance, the beneficiary, determines the maximum tax free threshold, known as the group threshold. There are three group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index.</P>
        <P>The 2005 group thresholds applying to a gift or inheritance for the categories referred to by the Deputy are as follows: group B threshold, to a parent, brother, sister, niece, nephew or grandchild, is &euro;46,673; group C threshold, to a relationship other than a son or daughter or those outlined in group B, is &euro;23,336.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of doubling these two thresholds would be &euro;132.9 million and &euro;45.22 million respectively. This equates to a very large proportion of the annual tax yield from CAT.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Finance Act 2000 introduced an exemption from CAT for the recipient of a dwelling-house where the dwelling-house is taken by way of a gift or inheritance provided certain conditions are satisfied. Essentially, CAT no longer applies in respect of a gift or inheritance of a dwelling-house taken on or after 1 December 1999, provided the recipient of the gift or inheritance had been living in the house for three years prior to the gift or inheritance and does not have an interest in any other residential property. Also, the recipient must continue, except where he or she is aged 55 years at the date of the gift or inheritance, to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of six years from the date of the gift or inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of gift or inheritance tax where the conditions for this relief are met.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>Market forces, and the availability of suitable infrastructure and backhaul, will determine whether a company offers broadband in any area. A principal reason for the slow roll out of broadband services generally has been the lack of investment by the private sector in the necessary infrastructure to deliver broadband to all areas. My Department is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building metropolitan area networks or MANs in 120 towns and cities nationwide, in association with the local authorities, using Government and European Regional Development Fund funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. MANs have already been completed in Gaoth Dobhair and Letterkenny, and MANs for Buncrana and Carndonagh are at the planning stage.</P>
        <P>The Government recently directed Departments to examine what could be done to alleviate the employment situation in the county, with particular focus on infrastructure development. Officials from my Department have since met representatives from Donegal County Council as well as local interest groups and are currently examining a number of options. I understand that the company in question attended the launch of the community networked services or CNS project in May 2005. The CNS project is funded by INTERREG IIIa and the International Fund for Ireland. The project is due to be completed in 2006 and further details can be requested from the promoter at its website <i>www.ernact.net.</i></P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including digital subscriber lines, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless.

        <P FLI="0">The enterprise development agencies are actively engaged in promoting both Lucan and Clondalkin as high potential locations in their efforts to secure new investment and additional jobs.</P>
        <P>IDA continues to market south County Dublin, as a potential location for new foreign direct investment, FDI. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major FDI projects, moving up the value chain. South County Dublin is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle and a third level institute of technology at Tallaght.</P>
        <P>This year the Japanese pharmaceuticals company Takeda Chemical Industries will complete construction of its facility at Grangecastle, Clondalkin. This is a significant and important investment from a leading company in Japan and will highlight Ireland as a key location for other such Japanese investors in the future. Also in Grangecastle, the pharmaceutical company Wyeth Biopharma opened this year and already employs approximately 900 highly skilled people. Wyeth continues to recruit and will eventually employ 1,300 at the facility in Greencastle.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland works with companies in its portfolio to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. The agency is encouraging companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and services. Since the beginning of 2002 Enterprise Ireland has approved over &euro;10 million and made payments of over &euro;9 million in support of development projects for indigenous companies in south County Dublin.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is also actively involved with the provision of infrastructure to facilitate business development and employment. The agency has supported the development of community enterprise centres in Bawnogue and Neilstown, <Col N="268"/>which are contributing to job creation in these areas. There is also a private incubation centre for start up projects and micro enterprises at the former Hills Mills factory in Lucan. These centres provide incubation space for start-ups and micro enterprises, and also provide ancillary services such as training, mentoring and customised courses to address the needs of the local clients. In the Lucan/Clondalkin area, Enterprise Ireland works closely with agencies such as Lucan 2000, Clondalkin partnership, the south Dublin chamber, the south Dublin county enterprise board and the local council.</P>
        <P>The south Dublin county enterprise board is also proactively involved in the development of indigenous enterprise, and provides a source of support for small businesses in the region.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Neither I nor my Department has any function in determining entitlement to a supplement in individual cases.</P>
        <P>Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment.</P><Col N="270"/>
        <P>The Dublin/mid-Leinster region of the executive has advised that it determined recently, in accordance with the rules of the scheme, that the rent supplement payable to the person concerned should be reduced as a result of an increase in her household income from employment. It has notified her of this revised supplement rate, which is due to go into effect shortly. My Department will also have to review the rate of one-parent family payment, OFP, payable to the person concerned in the light of her new employment situation. Any reduction in her OFP entitlements after this review is completed would in turn require some corresponding upward adjustment in her rate of rent supplement. My Department will notify the executive in this regard as soon as her revised OFP entitlements have been determined. If the person concerned has a particular non-recurring cost that she is unable to meet from her own resources, it is open to her to apply at any time to her local community welfare officer for an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

        <P>The company is internationally recognised as one that provides vendor independent, detailed ICT industry expertise. It provides industry analysis and access to its analysts through a number of membership services. It has clients in every industry sector and is ideally placed to provide examples of international good practice.</P>
        <P>General membership services provide my Department&rsquo;s information systems managers with access to independent reports and research papers on various aspects of new technologies and architectures. Executive programme membership further allows senior IT management in my Department to benefit from regular access to a designated highly qualified local consultant, unlimited access to analysts worldwide and specific guidance on enterprise level industry best practice as well as access to a network of senior IT organisations.</P>
        <P>Membership is through subscription services for which the normal public procurement tender process is not applicable. My Department has enrolled for membership at various levels over the years and the quality of the non-vendor specific material and data available has met its expectations. Given the scale and complexity of the Department&rsquo;s ICT, the budgets involved and the long-term implications of decisions taken, it considers that this access to quality independent advice represents good value for money.</P>
        <P>My Department has also engaged the company on a small number of projects over the years, as follows. My Department engaged the company to carry out a resource review of its IS division in 2000 and to benchmark against similar organisations. The company was chosen as a result of a public procurement process, for which eight companies submitted tenders. I am satisfied that value for money was achieved because the report delivered on the requirements and expectations. <Col N="272"/>Aspects of it have been implemented and it continues to inform ISD organisational policies.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the company was engaged to review and validate the information systems strategy, prepared by the Department&rsquo;s management team. The contract was placed in accordance with guidelines for single tender procurement. The review represented value for money because it confirmed the validity of the Department&rsquo;s approach to its future IS strategy, as well as highlighting gaps and informing the resolution of its strategic approach.</P>
        <P>The company was asked to carry out an independent validation of the business case and the approaches to improving the quality of data interfaces between different types of computer applications, current and future. It was the only company requested to tender for this work because of the nature and relatively small size of the contract. It was chosen for its expertise in the research and analysis of emerging trends in the software market, including integration between current and future application platforms. Value for money was achieved because the review confirmed the business case and the range of approaches that needed to be considered for future developments, including integration of existing applications with the emerging service delivery modernisation programme.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In October 1999, the Department held a competitive tendering exercise in which it invited proposals to prove the technical feasibility of build<Col N="272"/>ing applications using a business object model approach. A flat fee of £50,000 &mdash; equivalent to &euro;63,500 &mdash; plus VAT was offered for each proto<Col N="273"/>type. Following an evaluation process, three companies/consortiums were selected to develop suitable prototypes, one of which was led by the company in question. The prototypes were successfully delivered in the first half of 2000 and payment was made on 7 July 2000. Procurement was carried out in strict adherence to all relevant procurement legislation and resulting contracts were drawn up on a fixed price basis. I am satisfied that value for money has been achieved in this case.</P>
        <P>With regard to information systems services management support, there were two contracts with the company during the period. Each covered a number of years. Each procurement was carried out in accordance with national and EU procurement guidelines. The recommendations of the Department&rsquo;s evaluation groups were submitted to and approved by the Government contracts committee. The first contract covered the provision of assistance with a major project to ensure that the Department developed and maintained a continuous computing capability. A strategic review of the IS division was also undertaken. The second contract was for programme, project and change management support.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s IS services area underwent a successful major reorganisation in the second period and the consultancy support received played a significant role in that process. A major review of the Department&rsquo;s ICT infrastructure, to meet emerging needs and avail of new technologies, was carried out also and is currently being implemented. The advice received by my Department under these contracts is considered to have delivered significant value for money.</P>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme was a joint programme of work, between my Department and the Department of Health and Children, aimed at implementing a modern civil registration service and providing a building block for the integration of related public services. In 1999, following a competitive tendering process, the company was awarded a contract by my Department to provide support for a planning study to determine the approach to the design, development and implementation of a modern civil registration service. The tendering process was carried out in accordance with EU and Department of Finance guidelines. The total amount paid in respect of this contract amounted to &euro;61,455.32. I am satisfied that value for money was achieved in respect of this contract.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>In 2001, following a competitive tendering process, the company was awarded a contract by my Department for the design, development and implementation of a modern civil registration service. The tendering process was carried out in accordance with EU and Department of Finance guidelines. The total amount paid, by my Department, in respect of this contract amounted to <Col N="274"/>&euro;6,319,222. I am satisfied that value for money was achieved in respect of this contract.</P>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme and the consequent integration with the processing of child benefit claims has been recognised internationally as one of the finest examples of best practice in public administration over the last number of years. I am satisfied that the modernisation programme has resulted in the provision of a greatly enhanced service to the public, delivered on the wider e-government agenda and represents excellent value for money.</P>
        <P>With regard to Reach, payments to the company were made in respect of a technical architect, for advice on the design approach to the project and in respect of a contracted amount, &euro;15,000 plus VAT, paid to a number of companies, including the company named, in respect of some of the overhead costs of preparing prototypes as part of the material to be submitted with their tender to build the public services broker. The procurements were carried out in accordance with EU and national guidelines and my Department is satisfied that the deliverables met expectations in all respects.</P>

	<P>Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment. A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include special means disregards and tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme. People are entitled to retain certain social welfare and other secondary benefits in total or in part for the duration of the employment scheme, subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. An income limit of &euro;317.43 per week applies to the retention of these supplements. No income limit applies to the back to work allowance itself. While this supplement retention income limit has not changed since its introduction, significant other improvements have been made to the means test subsequently. <Col N="275"/>Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</P>
        <P>In effect, this means that people who commence employment through a back to work scheme, following a period of unemployment, can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the &euro;317.43 limit and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement: for example, in the first year of their participation in the back to work allowance scheme, a single person can have combined income from the back to work allowance and wages of &euro;429, while a couple with two children can have a combined income of &euro;528.25. These thresholds increase each year in the budget.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement may be retained for up to four years on a tapered basis, that is, 75% of supplement in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the maximum payment limit of &euro;317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes. As a consequence, many families retain more of their rent supplement than had been the case prior to these changes taking place.</P>
        <P>People availing of an employment support scheme may opt to be assessed under either standard supplementary welfare allowance rules or under the special retention rules, and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option for them. A person on a community employment scheme or other back to work scheme whose household income is above the &euro;317.43 limit for retention of secondary benefits may still qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules. In that context, I introduced amending regulations in January 2005 to increase the income disregard in the standard rules of the scheme from &euro;50 to &euro;60 per week.</P>
        <P>Overall, I consider that the current eligibility thresholds and disregards, together with improvements in the standard rules of the supplementary <Col N="276"/>welfare allowance scheme, ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up back-to-work opportunities. The effectiveness of these arrangements is being considered further in the context of a policy review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which my Department is undertaking at present.</P>

        <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo was not granted unemployment benefit on finishing work; if he will provide a full and complete breakdown of their PRSI contribution record.</Quest>

	<P>To qualify for unemployment benefit a person must have, since the date of entry into insurance, at least 52 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate social insurance contributions have been paid and must have at least 39 paid or credited contributions in the relevant tax year, currently 2003, or 26 paid contributions in the relevant tax year and 26 paid contributions in the preceding year.</P>
        <P>According to the records of my Department the person concerned has 20 class A contributions and 21 class J contributions in the tax year 2003. Class J contributions normally relate to employed persons with reckonable pay of less than &euro;38.00 per week and provide cover for occupational injuries benefit only. The application for unemployment benefit from the person concerned was, therefore, disallowed from 4 April 2005, as she did not satisfy the contribution conditions for receipt of the benefit. She was informed accordingly on 29 April 2005. The person concerned may have an entitlement to credited contributions while she is unemployed. She should contact her local social welfare office for further information in this regard.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
        <P>The PRSI record of the person concerned is set out in the following table. </P><Col N="275"/>

	<P>A deciding officer disallowed the unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned from 3 August 2005 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking employment. The person concerned had failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that he had been consistently seeking full-time work. It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 11 October 2005.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>The Disability Federation of Ireland was one of over 30 representative organisations that attended this Department&rsquo;s pre-budget forum with me on 17 October 2005. At this forum, each organisation had the opportunity to present its key priorities for consideration in advance of budget 2006. I have also received the written submission from the Disability Federation of Ireland, which contains proposals relating to, <i>inter alia</i>, the introduction of a cost of disability payment; increases to the rate of disability allow<Col N="278"/>ance; mainstreaming and support for the voluntary sector.</P>
        <P>My Department will consider the proposals submitted by the disability federation and will continue to progress the work currently ongoing with other Departments on policy issues relating to people with disabilities. In this regard, the work of the interdepartmental group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, chaired by the Department of Health and Children, and at which my Department is represented, is currently considering the feasibility of the introduction of a cost of disability payment. The introduction of a cost of disability payment is one of the priorities identified by the Disability Federation of Ireland in its pre-budget submission.</P>
        <P>Any changes proposed in submissions received from representative organisations will, of course, have to be considered in the context of the wider social welfare budgetary package.</P>

	<P>In order to deal with the delays in obtaining a driving test, my Department and the Department of Finance agreed a package of measures to reduce the backlog of driving test applications. An essential part of the package includes a bonus scheme for existing driver testers. The other elements of the package are the recruitment of additional testers and the outsourcing of a block of tests.</P>
        <P>A bonus scheme was agreed with the driver testers branch of IMPACT and offered to the driver testers last June. However, the members subsequently rejected the bonus scheme as they were opposed to the outsourcing element of the package. The driver testers branch submitted alternative proposals for a bonus scheme, which was designed to deal with the backlog without outsourcing a block of tests. However, these pro<Col N="281"/>posals were not acceptable to the Department as they would not deliver the required 80,000 additional driving tests in the same timeframe and at comparable cost with the package of measures as originally proposed.</P>

I understand that in making a decision on a planning application, a planning authority is required, under the Planning and Development Act 2000, to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, regard being given to the provisions of the development plan, other relevant ministerial or Government policies and any submissions or observations received on the planning application.</P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA. The allocation to the NRA for national road improvement has been increased substantially since 1997 and stands at &euro;1.319 billion for 2005. In addition, &euro;53.9 million has been provided for road maintenance in 2005, including the type of road maintenance activities referred to by the Deputy. The allocation of this funding to individual projects is a matter for the NRA.</P>
        <P>The NRA, apart from the ongoing upgrading and maintenance of the national road network, including the ongoing pavement restoration programme, which provides a substantial road safety dividend, also funds specific road safety programmes, including the high risk accident location programme, the high cost remedial measures programme, the fitting of crash barriers on motorways and dual carriageways and road safety research.</P>
        <P>Since 1994, the NRA, in conjunction with local authorities, has operated a programme where accident locations on the national road network are investigated and, if the road condition is believed to have been a factor, appropriate engineering measures are put in place to improve the situation. On average 80 such locations are treated each year. The high cost remedial measures programme was begun in 2004 and <Col N="283"/>focuses on areas where more expensive works are required to solve the accident problems at particular locations. A total of 12 sites have been targeted in 2005. Median safety barriers are being installed on all new motorways and dual carriageways. The programme of retrofitting barriers to existing motorways and dual carriageways is two thirds complete. This work is expected to be complete by the end of this year.</P>

	<P>The national development plan envisages that a proportion of the national roads programme will be implemented by means of public private partnerships, PPPs, which involve private sector funding, remunerated in part by user tolls. The model selected for national road PPP projects to date is the design, build, operate and finance, DBFO, model. Through PPPs, private sector innovation is harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance and will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. Value for money is the key factor which determines whether a project is undertaken on a PPP basis. It is considered at present that this is best achieved on toll road projects through the integrated DBFO model where the private sector shares the toll revenue risk.</P>

	<P>The average Monday to Friday carryings are 60,000 passengers per day. In 2005, Luas is on course to carry nearly 21 million passengers. This is substantially ahead of projected passenger numbers. The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and the Dublin Transportation Office are carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the effect of Luas on travel patterns. The &ldquo;before Luas&rdquo; survey was carried out in the spring of 2004 and it is intended that the &ldquo;after Luas&rdquo; survey will be carried out in 2006 when travel patterns on Luas have become more established.</P>
        <P>The RPA has also carried out less formal research on its customer base and it is clear that a large proportion of Luas users had previously used private vehicles. Apart from car transfers, there also appears to be a significant number of new trips to the city centre for business and recreation. This view is shared by city centre businesses, which report a substantial increase in business as a result of Luas and is reflected in the high levels of Luas usage in the traditional off peak periods and at weekends.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254 and 257 together.</P>
        <P>Traffic management in general is a matter for the appropriate local authority and in the case of <Col N="286"/>the M50, the city centre and in the vicinity of Dublin Port that authority is Dublin City Council. As a major new element in Dublin&rsquo;s road network the Dublin Port tunnel will have a considerable beneficial impact on traffic flow in the Dublin area. It will be of particular benefit in facilitating improved access to Dublin Port for HGVs while reducing HGV traffic in the city. The NRA and Dublin City Council are working to ensure that the tunnel, when open, will integrate smoothly with the existing road network. These works include a new entrance for Dublin Port and, as part of the M50 upgrade scheme, the upgrading of the M1-M50 junction and the widening of the M1 between Coolock Lane and the M50 junction to three lanes in each direction.</P>
        <P>The NRA and Dublin City Council are also organising an interim third lane on the northbound carriageway of the M1 between Coolock Lane and the M50 junctions to provide temporary capacity increase and facilitate merging of tunnel and surface road traffic in this area prior to full improvements under the M50 upgrade scheme.</P>
        <P>It is the view of Dublin City Council and the NRA that the Dublin Port tunnel will facilitate almost all of the HGV traffic currently using Dublin Port. The issue of routing vehicles unable to use the tunnel through the city will be addressed in the context of the heavy goods vehicle management strategy being prepared by Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s formal role will be to put in place the necessary regulatory framework relating to traffic and parking management and road signage to support the strategy. In addition, my Department will continue to liaise with Dublin City Council as the strategy is finalised, so that I may be assured that the primary objective of the Dublin Port tunnel &mdash; to provide a high quality access route to Dublin Port for heavy goods vehicles &mdash; is achieved in a manner which maximises the overall traffic benefit of the tunnel.</P>

        <P>Since 2000, a total of 55 projects have been approved for funding under the regional airports measure of the NDP.

To date, &euro;11.7 million has been paid out in grant assistance under the measure. The projects are generally on target and it is expected that all projects will be delivered within the timeframe of the NDP and the approved grant allocation for each airport will not be exceeded.</P>
        <P>The national development plan provides for a substantial investment in the upgrade of the national road network over the period 2000-2006. Since the start of the plan, 53 projects have been completed. Work is in progress on 21 projects, another 18 projects are at tender stage and a further eight projects are through the statutory approval process. While the completion of the upgrade programme will extend beyond 2006 and will cost more than estimated in 1999, in recent years most projects have been completed within the cost budgeted at tender stage. Allied to the delivery of these schemes in accordance with their projected timescales, the national roads programme is now on a firm footing to deliver efficiently the vital infrastructure needed to sustain our economic growth and competitiveness.</P>

	<P>In order to deal with the unacceptable delays in obtaining a driving test, my Department and the Department of Finance have agreed a package of measures to reduce the backlog of driving test <Col N="288"/>applications. The package includes a bonus scheme for driver testers, the recruitment of additional testers as well as the outsourcing of a block of tests. The package has the potential to deliver up to 80,000 additional driving tests and is currently the subject of negotiations with the staff associations.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the EU Council Regulation No. 1258/99 on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy and Commission Regulation No. 1663/95, since 1995 the European Commission only finances expenditure <Col N="292"/>that is made by paying agencies accredited by member states. As part of the accreditation process, the regulations require that the annual accounts of the CAP paying agencies in member states must be accompanied by an attestation certificate regarding the integrity, exactitude and veracity of the annual accounts. This certificate must be given by a certifying body that is operationally independent of the paying agency. In this context, some payments were made to Arthur Andersen from 1997 to 1999. The greater number of items in the Accenture table from 2000 to date relate to the purchase of contracted software development resources rather than consultancy.</P><Col N="291"/>

In 2002, The company were asked to provide expertise to build a multi project method of secure access to systems within DAF. This was to be built upon their own security modules.
	         </entry>
                <entry>
As The company had provided the technical framework for the J2EE environment and had prepared the Technical Architecture design for that environment, they were commissioned to undertake the building of a system to provide secure access for all our staff to all new IT systems with the flexibility to move seamlessly and efficiently between these systems. This was a force majeure measure as (1) other projects were being delayed, with potential cost implications, due to the lack of such a secure access facility (2) issue had been raised during EU Certification Audit (3) the essential skills and expertise were not available within the Department (4) the underlying environment had been designed and built by The company

                <entry>
The Department now had a secure method of access to all systems for its internal staff. The system was now capable of handling multi-application access. This meant less coding and time savings for future developers. This increased security had been an essential requirement which had been identified by the Certifying Body during part of the annual Accreditation Audit of the Department as an EU Paying Agency

	<P>The Government is committed to achieving a balanced agreement between the various elements of the WTO negotiations, which are expected to reach a conclusion at the ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December. In so far as agriculture is concerned, the over-riding objective is to ensure that the terms of the final agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>More specifically, the priorities are to ensure that the phasing-out of all forms of export subsidies will be applied in parallel, as provided for under the WTO framework agreement which was concluded in August 2004, and that the phasing-out period will be as long as possible; that Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural exports will remain competitive in the EU market through the continuation of adequate levels of tariff protection on imports from third countries; that the EU system of direct payments which, following decoupling, qualify as non-trade-distorting, will continue to be exempt from reductions under the new agreement.</P>
        <P>The Commission negotiates in the WTO on the basis of a mandate which was agreed by the Council of Ministers. The mandate reflects the position following the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. At a meeting of the General Affairs and Foreign Ministers Council on 18 October which I attended, it was again agreed <Col N="300"/>that the mandate remained valid and that it constitutes the limits for the EU&rsquo;s negotiating brief in the WTO. I will continue to monitor developments in the negotiations and to participate fully in discussions with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome for Irish agriculture.</P>

Following computer validation, the application of the person named was randomly selected for, and was the subject of, a ground cross compliance inspection. During the course of the inspection it was discovered that a land parcel, which was claimed as forage only, also contained forestry. This error was deemed to be a non-intentional declaration. The areas involved have been redigitised by my Department and given two separate parcel numbers. The application of the person named has been fully processed for payment and this payment will issue as soon as possible.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department has appropriate structures in place to deal with the veterinary dimension of the avian influenza threat and is, of course, also in ongoing liaison with the Department of Health and Children. My Department has already put in place an early warning system, with the co-operation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and BirdWatch Ireland, through which unusual or increased patterns of wild bird mortalities are reported.</P>
        <P>My Department has been engaged in a risk based approach to the implementation of appropriate measures to minimise the risk of the introduction of avian influenza to Ireland. While endeavouring to reduce the risk of the introduc<Col N="301"/>tion of the disease, much of our effort is placed on the early detection and speedy eradication of the disease.</P>
        <P>An EU Commission decision adopted in Brussels last Friday provides for the introduction of additional biosecurity measures and early detection systems. Each member state is required to implement the measures provided for on the basis of a risk assessment, taking full account of the criteria and risk factors set out in the annexes to the decision. Following the decision adopted on Friday last, officials of my Department met the other stakeholders to review the provisions of the decision and the effective operation of the existing early warning system.</P>
        <P>A further key element in early detection is testing carried out under the annual avian influenza survey plan, as provided for by Commission Decision 2005/464/EC. The testing of samples is undertaken by the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Abbotstown.</P>
        <P>There has been a serological monitoring programme in place since 1995 as part of the poultry health programme that monitors commercial breeding poultry, chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, just before they come into lay and when they move sites. In addition, blood samples from clinically sick poultry are screened, as are commercial layer flocks before export. Some 20,000 samples are screened for all subtypes annually.</P>
        <P>A more extensive survey including other categories of poultry and wild birds has been carried out as part of an EU survey since 2002. It is expected that, as part of this year&rsquo;s survey, samples will again be taken from birds in wildlife sanctuaries of international interest as well as game clubs. During last year&rsquo;s sample, 350 samples were analysed and it is anticipated that this figure will be exceeded this year. Surveillance is central to the early detection and the outcome of the surveillance of wild birds should further provide valuable information, for an early warning system, of strains that may be introduced to poultry from wild birds.</P>
        <P>In addition to the early warning arrangements, my Department has also updated and reissued advice and information on biosecurity measures to be taken by poultry flock owners as well as measures that might be taken to minimise the risk of introducing the disease. My Department has also published the clinical symptoms of avian influenza to watch out for and has issued advice to those travelling to and from affected areas. The Department is continually reassessing the level of risk, in light of any emerging information and taking account of the most up-to-date veterinary and scientific advice available. We will continue to operate a risk based approach and maintain a measured response to the risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, we have a range of measures to put in place to ensure the early eradication of the disease, <Col N="302"/>including the slaughtering of birds and the declaration of a 3 km protection zone and a 10km surveillance zone around the infected premises. Movements of poultry, poultry transport, carcasses, eggs and other articles likely to transmit the virus would be controlled by licence. The infected premises would be subject to cleaning and disinfecting under official supervision of my Department.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that my Department has, based on the current level of risk, put in place such measures as are appropriate and I will not hesitate to introduce such additional measures as may be appropriate to any increased risk.</P>

	<P>Export refunds were paid in the period from 1 May 2002 to 30 September 2005 in respect of the export of approximately 1,000 tonnes of beef to Egypt. Trade was significantly affected by the special and onerous conditions attached to the export regime by the Egyptian authorities in the period in question. These involved considerable additional costs for the traders with regard to testing, veterinary inspections and so forth.</P>
        <P>After considerable work on the Egyptian market I can say that significant progress has been made following the signing last August of a new protocol on veterinary and animal health conditions to be applied to Irish beef exports to Egypt. I anticipate that this development, which effectively reduces the costs associated with beef exports to this destination, along with the higher export refund rate for Egypt, will enhance trade prospects this autumn.</P>
        <P>Beef exports to Egypt have only recently resumed and I am delighted that, over the past month, traders have taken out export licences for Egypt amounting to 1,400 tonnes.</P>

	<P>The contracts and services provided to my Department by the company in question since 1997 are outlined below.</P>
        <P>A contract to supply and implement a financial management system for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Courts Service, the Irish Prison Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was awarded to the company in question in March 2002. The tender was advertised through the <i>EU Journal</i> and all responses were <Col N="304"/>evaluated on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender by a team comprising senior officers from each of the end-user agencies. The project was managed using PRINCE methodology and included a project board which met regularly for the duration of the project and oversaw all aspects of the project, including quality assurance. The scope of the project was subsequently extended to include services for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P>All defined deliverables were completed within the terms of the original contract and as a result of the project coming in under budget, the company in question agreed to include further deliverables outside the scope of the original contract at no additional cost, representing significant value for money for the Department. The cost of this contract to date is &euro;14,124,005.81. This project is yielding very significant results in that the full range of financial management services for all the Departments and agencies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service, are being delivered: for example, the payroll element alone comprises salary payments to about 22,000 staff who are paid either every week or fortnightly.</P>
        <P>A separate contract was awarded to the company in question in January 2005 for the supply <Col N="305"/>and implementation of a calculation and payment system for the criminal legal aid process. Similar procurement arrangements applied for this contract as for the financial management system project. This contract is for a fixed price of &euro;560,720.40, of which &euro;363,65 has been paid to date. This project also came in on time and within budget and represents value for money and a significant improvement on the predecessor system, which had been in operation for a considerable number of years.</P>
        <P>Following an evaluation process carried out by representatives from the asylum agencies and divisions of the Department, a contract was awarded to the company in question for the development of a high level information management and information technology strategic plan for the asylum services. Work commenced in May 2002. This work was carried out under the control of a project board made up of representatives from the asylum agencies and divisions of the Department, including business users and information technology users. Board meetings were held at regular intervals and all deliverables were monitored carefully. The contract was for the fixed price of &euro;127,000, including VAT. The final strategy was delivered in October 2002 and is currently being implemented by the Department I regret it has not been possible in the time available to compile information in respect of contracts or services provided by this company to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will be forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</P>

However, I have made inquiries with the Garda authorities and I am informed that it is normal investigative procedure for the report of a burglary to be followed up by a visit from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the scene to confirm that a crime has taken place and gather evidence in support of a criminal investigation. The gathering of evidence may include finger mark evidence, depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
        <P>The role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.

	<P>The three visa applications in question were received by my Department on 7 September 2005 for the stated purposes of enabling the applicants to travel to the State to reside with their parents here. The mother of the applicants arrived in the State on 22 September 2002 and made an unsuccessful asylum application. She gave birth on 7 October 2002 and applied for residency based solely on parentage of an Irish born child. This was granted in April 2005. The father of the applicants arrived in the State on 10 March 2005 and made an unsuccessful asylum application. He also applied for residency based on parentage of the same Irish born child. This was granted in September 2005.</P>
        <P>Applicants for permission to reside in the State solely on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child were made fully aware of Government policy in this area, namely, that persons granted residency on that basis should not expect to have any entitlement to be joined in the State by other family members. This fact was clearly stated on the front page of the application form for such residency. The application form also included a statutory declaration to be signed by applicants indicating their acceptance, <i>inter alia</i>, that the granting of such permission to remain does not <Col N="308"/>confer any entitlements or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related or not, to enter the State.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Tallaght Garda station as on 18 October 2005 was 173 for all ranks. The personnel strength of Tallaght Garda station as on 31 December 1997 was 133 for all ranks. This represents an increase of 40% or 30% in the number of personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda station since that date. Local Garda management states it is satisfied that resources currently available in Tallaght are adequate to meet the policing needs of the community.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that Tallaght community garda&iacute; work in close co-operation with South Dublin County Council tackling anti-social behaviour. Community garda&iacute; are assigned to ten specific neighbourhoods or parishes that comprise the Tallaght area and are in close working relationship with statutory and voluntary agencies and community representatives on a daily basis. Specific areas of concern with regard to anti-social behaviour are targeted for more intensive policing.</P>
        <P>Regarding Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign of 1,100 Garda recruits each year to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context the needs of Tallaght will be fully considered within the overall context of areas throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-2006, which is implemented by my Department, has been a landmark development in Irish child care policy. As this very successful investment programme nears its final stage, the full range of child care issues and how we should best address them are being critically examined in a number of fora at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At official level, the issue of a follow-up programme to the EOCP is currently being examined in the context of the broad-ranging consideration of child care issues being undertaken by representatives of a number of Departments taking part in the high level working group on early childhood care and education under the co-ordination of the National Children&rsquo;s Office. In addition, a number of respected bodies have issued or are about to issue informative reports. These include the recent reports of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, and the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF. Other reports expected to be published shortly include the national quality framework for early childhood services by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, CECDE, and the early years curriculum by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA. The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is also expected to comment on child care when it issues its expected report. These reports and their recommendations will inform the present consideration of the wide range of cross-cutting issues that affect child care.</P>
        <P>While it is not possible at this stage to comment on the nature of any follow-on programme to the EOCP, the Government is already committed to continued expenditure beyond the end of the programme to ensure that its momentum is maintained. I believe this indicates a strong commitment to the adoption of a future programme to further develop our child care infrastructure. EOCP funding commitments have been made beyond 2006 in respect of both capital and staffing grant assistance. The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the present programme. An additional capital provision of &euro;90 million was made available over the period 2005-09 in the context of the 2005 budget. Of this amount, &euro;50 million is being made available under the present programme and the remaining &euro;40 million will flow under the next phase of the post-2006 EOCP.</P>
        <P>Regarding staffing grant assistance and following a detailed review of the existing staffing <Col N="310"/>grants under the EOCP, my Department recently extended the terms of the grants to the end of December 2007 to groups that have received staffing grants for a period of three or more years and which continue to deliver a child care service in accordance with their pre-agreed targets. My Department has been at the forefront of developing quality child care services through the EOCP and I hope to continue this role and its valuable contribution to future Government policy on child care. Pending a decision by Government in this regard, I am not in a position to comment further on the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A total of 33 city-county child care committees, CCCs, were established in 2001 to prepare and deliver a five year child care development strategy plan to address the specific child care needs of each of the 33 local areas. To implement its strategy plan, each CCC prepares an annual action plan, which is funded under the quality measure of the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000 &mdash; 2006. I allocated over &euro;7.6 million to the 33 CCCs for the implementation of their 2005 action plans.</P>
        <P>I also approved annual funding to the 33 CCCs for the implementation of the national child minding initiative, specifically targeted at child minders, who play a key role in the delivery of child care. I allocated &euro;965,000 to this initiative in 2005 which supports training, networking, information needs and a quality awareness programme of lectures. Funding is also available under this initiative to child minders to enhance their service through small developmental capital grants of up to 90% of the total cost with a maximum of &euro;630. I made available a funding allocation of &euro;1.89 million for this purpose in 2004. However, as the numbers seeking the grants were less than anticipated, this allocation was carried over to 2005. My Department is currently reviewing the child minders grants element of the EOCP to assess the future needs in this area.</P>
        <P>The national child minding initiative commenced in 2003 and, consequently, figures relating to persons participating are only available from the beginning of 2004. Between January 2004 and June 2005, 547 child minders availed of the child minder development grants and 3,362 child minders attended the quality awareness lecture programme and other training courses provided by the CCCs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">To the end of September 2005, 832 applications from community based and not for profit projects received staffing grant assistance, totalling over &euro;162 million under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-06. This is in addition to capital funding of &euro;233.5 million allocated under the programme to the end of September 2005.</P>
        <P>Total funding allocated under the programme to the end of September 2005 is expected to lead to the creation of approximately 39,000 new child care places and to support a further 31,500 existing child care places. By the end of June 2005, approximately 26,000 of these new places were already in place. Staffing grant assistance under the EOCP is normally approved for three years in the first instance. Subsequent approval of continuation funding normally follows a review of the extent to which a service is meeting the targets agreed in its contract with Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, which is engaged by my Department to manage the day to day administration of the grants.</P>
        <P>To benefit from funding, groups must continue to pay particular attention to supporting disadvantaged families and to the implementation of a fee structure tailored to the differing economic circumstances of their client group, thereby <Col N="312"/>ensuring that child care places subsidised by the EOCP are targeted towards those most in need. Following a detailed review of the existing staffing grants under the EOCP, my Department recently extended the terms of the grants to the end of December 2007 to groups which received staffing grants for a period of three or more years and which continue to deliver a child care service in accordance with their pre-agreed targets.</P>
        <P>Where a service is significantly failing to meet the terms of its contract, the level of funding under the EOCP may be revised downwards. The converse is also true and a service significantly exceeding the targets in its contract may have its funding revised upwards. Should the Deputy have a query with regard to the level of funding approved for a specific child care service, my Department will be happy to supply him with the relevant details.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The interim evaluation of the EOCP and the mid-term evaluation commented positively on the performance of the child care measures, resulting in the allocation of additional funds to the child care measures. This increased the EU contribution to the child care measures from &euro;170 million to &euro;181 million. The reviews also highlighted the fact that the EOCP was performing well and that it was likely to meet the targets set in 1999 and 2000 well within the lifetime of the NDP.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P>On this basis my Department proposed revised targets for expenditure under the NDP to the managing authorities of the regional operational programmes. These amendments were agreed with the managing authorities and later approved by the respective monitoring committees of the regional operational programmes. The increase in the targets of the EOCP were a result of positive programme performance and took into account <Col N="313"/>the additional funding for the measures and, as a result, an increase in the target was warranted.</P>
        <P>The number of women in the active workforce continues to increase rapidly and has grown from a figure of 400,400 in 1990, to 819,000 in 2005. This increase is clearly an important contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s growing need for child care service provision, a need which the EOCP was established to address.</P>

	<P>Procedures for processing complaints by parents and students will be prescribed for all schools under section 28 of the Education Act 1998. Currently, most schools use procedures that have been arrived at through national agreements negotiated between management authorities and teacher unions. Under the CPSMA-INTO and the ASTI-JMB procedures that are in common usage in primary schools and voluntary secondary schools respectively, the board of management may invite the complainant to address a meeting of the board.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the president of the college in question resigned from that position in April 2005. That matter related to the employee-employer relationship between the head of the college and that person&rsquo;s employers, which, I understand, was subject to legal proceedings. In this regard, it is considered that it is not appropriate for me to make any comment.</P>
        <P>The institute referred to in the question is a private institution and individual employees are employed by the management authorities of the institute. Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment on their reasons for departure. I have, however, been assured by the trustees of the institute that the former members of staff referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question will be replaced immediately.</P>
        <P>I have a direct role with regard to the funding provided by my Department to the institute in question. That is why I asked the accountancy firm, PwC, to examine the use of moneys paid by my Department to the institute referred to by the Deputy. The main findings of the report, which I published in early August, revealed that there has been no misuse of the public moneys paid by my Department to the institute.</P><Col N="325"/>
        <P>Although my Department did not have any concerns regarding the use of funding provided for the purpose of training teachers, it was nevertheless important, in view of the level of public and media interest in this matter, to demonstrate clearly that public funding was properly applied for teacher training. I am happy that the findings of the examination confirm this position. The trustees of the institute have also commissioned a report by Farrell Grant Sparks. I am confident that these two reports can be used to develop financial and management practices which will bring greater accountability with regard to moneys paid by my Department. I expect that they will also contribute to the current review by the trustees of the present structure of the institute and facilitate permanent governance and management arrangements which will attract the support and confidence of all concerned.</P>
        <P>The trustees of the institute in question have announced that a new interim director and president are in place for the coming academic year. I understand that these interim arrangements are working well at the institute and have the backing of the staff. I have asked that my officials maintain ongoing contact with the trustees and interim director and president at the institute concerned.</P>
        <P>In addition, a senior official from my Department has recently joined the governing body of the institute for an interim period. I am sure that the Deputy will agree that these significant developments at the institute demonstrate a clear indication, from all concerned, that they remain fully committed to the future of teacher education at the institute.</P>
        <P>Finally, my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate will continue to monitor the quality of the graduates on an ongoing basis to ensure that the highest quality students leave all colleges of this nature. This is a well established monitoring process and one which has worked very well.</P>

	<P>The objective of the national development plan is to support the development of all educational sectors regardless of ethos.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, I, as Minister, am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State. Applying this provision to the development of multi-<Col N="326"/>denominational education at primary level, my Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post-primary level, the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through non-designated vocational education committee schools.</P>
        <P>To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band 1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable. These measures are a strong indication of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do so as part of its statutory obligations.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the school&rsquo;s enrolment on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. If some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the school&rsquo;s teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s inspectorate to monitor the deployment of staff and class sizes, to discuss where necessary with the school authorities the basis on which <Col N="329"/>school policy decisions in this regard have been made and to report to the Department, where appropriate. The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is one principal and 12 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 323 pupils on 30 September 2004. The school also has two learning support and resource teachers.</P>

	<P>The position is my Department, in co-operation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has been funding a radon detection and remediation programme in schools since 1998. The radon reference set for the workplace under the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000, S.I. No. 125 of 2000, is 400 Bq/m3. In schools with levels above 400 Bq/m3 the management authorities are advised to secure the services of a suitably qualified consultant architect or engineer to carry out all necessary remedial works and grants are provided by my Department for these works. My Department also issues grants to schools for the installation of suitable vents in classrooms where radon levels are between 200 Bq/m3 and 400 Bq/m3, notwithstanding the fact that the radon reference for workplaces is 400 Bq/m3.</P>
        <P>Following completion of remediation works, post-remediation measurements are carried out by the RPII to determine if the remediation has been effective. This process is ongoing and the RPII continues to carry out post-remediation testing in schools.</P>
        <P>With regard to the school in question, this was one of a number of schools for which my Department made arrangements on their behalf directly with the consultant architects for radon mitigation works to be carried out. A post-reme<Col N="331"/>diation test showed that the remediation works did not bring the levels down to an acceptable level. On the instructions of the consultant architects a broken fan was replaced and the radon levels are now well below the reference levels mentioned, at levels of 57 Bq/m3 and under.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The guidelines can only be deviated from where a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2004 was 242 pupils, which warrants a staffing of principal plus nine mainstream posts for the 2005-2006 school year. On the basis of projected enrolments, a developing school post was approved provisionally. However, the required enrolment figure at 30 September 2005 was not achieved.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under <Col N="332"/>which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02. The board of management of the school has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeals board under developing school criteria. As outlined in the relevant application form, this appeal will be considered by the appeals board at its meeting on 19 October 2005. The board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

	<P>My Department funds the provision of adult literacy, which is delivered by the vocational education committees, from the adult literacy and community education, ALCES, budget. The national development plan committed &euro;93.5 million to the service in the period 2000-06, with a target of reaching 113,000 clients over that period. This target will be met. The Department&rsquo;s budget for adult literacy for the years 2000-2005 was &euro;10.6 million for 2000; &euro;13.6 million for 2001; &euro;16.7million for 2002; &euro;17.9 million for 2003; &euro;19.2 million for 2004; and &euro;22.0 million for 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department, under a separate budget, provides for an education service in the prisons. This prison education budget includes literacy. The amount allocated to City of Dublin VEC for literacy initiatives in each of the years 2001-2005 was &euro;1,194,457 for 2001; &euro;2,718,106 for 2002; &euro;2,687,136 for 2003; &euro;2,734,000 for 2004; and &euro;2,908,406 for 2005. The amount allocated for the year 2000 is not readily available as it is archived. The Department will, however, furnish this information to the Deputy within the next few days. It should be noted that the figure for 2005 represents the provision only.</P>
        <P>The returns made to the Department for the year ended December 2004 indicate that CDVEC has four full-time and six part-time adult literacy organisers, ALOs; that D&uacute;n Laoghaire VEC has one full-time and no part-time ALO; and County Dublin VEC has five full-time ALOs and six part-time ALOs. Dublin Adult Learning Centre is <Col N="333"/>funded separately to provide literacy services in its catchment area. This funding is additional to the CDVEC funding detailed above but is channelled through the CDVEC for administrative purposes.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the new general allocation system is intended to cater for children with high incidence special needs and those with learning support needs. The system was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>Disadvantaged schools that satisfied the Department&rsquo;s criteria for additional staffing under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme &mdash; a scheme to help schools with high levels of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds &mdash; avail of a preferential pupil teacher ratio of 8:1. Small schools not eligible for additional staffing under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme also avail of preferential pupil teacher ratios under the general allocation compared to larger schools. It has always been the case that schools that were in receipt of resource teacher support in respect of pupils with special edu<Col N="334"/>cational needs would lose teacher support &mdash; either full posts or part-time hours &mdash; when the pupils that triggered the extra support left the school.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has introduced a new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education &mdash; three to 18 years &mdash; from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of some &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>My Department officials anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools about the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</P>

In this area at present, 22 out of 25 primary schools and five out of six post-primary schools &mdash; two of these are VEC schools &mdash; have a direct educational psychological service either from NEPS or, in the case of the two VEC schools, from the County Dublin VEC.</P>
        <P>Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of a panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process, and the conditions that apply to the scheme, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased almost three-fold from 43 on establishment to 124 at present. On behalf of my Department, the Public Appointments Service has recently conducted a recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to NEPS, with recruitment being targeted in such a way as to increase the numbers of NEPS psychologists in priority areas.

	<P>Section 27 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that all reasonable legal costs and other costs associated with the preparation and presentation of an application to the redress board will be met by the board. In the event that agreement cannot be reached between the board and the applicant&rsquo;s legal representative, the matter is referred to the taxing master of the High Court for determination.</P>
        <P>The redress board&rsquo;s published guidelines and other publicity material on the redress scheme specifically highlight the fact that all reasonable <Col N="337"/>legal costs incurred in respect of applications for redress are payable by the board. Furthermore, as solicitors are required under law to fully inform their clients, in writing, of the legal costs payable in their case, it is incumbent on the solicitor to inform an applicant to the redress board that all reasonable legal costs will be met by the board and that the applicant should not have to pay any legal costs.</P>
        <P>The Law Society of Ireland is the body responsible under law for regulating the solicitor profession and as such it is a matter for the society to investigate complaints about the conduct of a solicitor. Earlier this year, my Department became aware that the society had taken the view that it was precluded from investigating complaints from applicants with regard to overcharging by solicitors as a result of the prohibition on disclosure of information under section 28 of the redress Act. Arising from this, I included an amendment to this section on Committee Stage of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005 to enable the Law Society of Ireland to investigate such complaints. This Bill was enacted into law on 9 July 2005. In early October, the Attorney General wrote to the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council in clarification of the issue. That correspondence is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The redress scheme was set up by the Government to help alleviate the injury and suffering experienced by victims of child abuse in residential institutional care. Awards made by the board are payable in full to the applicant, without any deduction for costs. It is a disgraceful practice that some solicitors would take advantage of their clients by overcharging as reported. I welcome the steps taken by the Law Society of Ireland to examine and deal with the issue of overcharging by solicitors and to ensure that applicants to the redress board are fully reimbursed where overcharging has arisen. I expect the society to take whatever action is appropriate.</P>

	<P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not provide direct funding for museums. The Maritime Museum is housed in the Mariners&rsquo; Church towards which the Department <Col N="339"/>made a grant of &euro;20,000 in 2002 from the conservation grants scheme under the urban and village renewal operational programme.</P>
        <P>A further application for funding under the scheme was made in 2004. However, on that occasion the project was unsuccessful in obtaining funding as there was no evidence of matching funding. The assessment panel considered the magnitude of the estimated overall cost of the project made it inappropriate for grant assistance from this source. It is open to the applicants to apply for funding under the 2006 scheme, and an application form has been sent to the project promoter. The deadline for receipt of applications under the 2006 scheme is 23 October 2005.</P>
        <P>Grants for heritage buildings are also available from either local authorities or the Heritage Council.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. Under the directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005. Practical implementation of the directive in Ireland is organised mainly <Col N="340"/>through a collective industry based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully. In 2001 it met the target of 25% packaging waste recycling required by the directive.</P>
        <P>Ireland is on course to meet the higher recovery and recycling targets specified for end-2005. The Environmental Protection Agency has reported in its national waste database interim report for 2003, published in December 2004, that packaging waste recovery increased to 44% in that year, up from 35% in 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While Article 15 of Directive 94/62/EC allows member states to adopt economic measures, such as deposit and refund schemes, in support of the objectives of the directive, successful deposit and refund schemes operating internationally for beverage containers are generally located in those countries where there has been no break in the continuity and cultural tradition of deposit and refund arrangements. This is not the case in Ireland and there would now quite likely be significant costs involved in re-establishing deposit and refund arrangements here. Account would also have to be taken of the possible impact on existing compliance arrangements. Given that these arrangements are achieving the desired result for meeting the recycling targets, the introduction of deposit and refund schemes for beverage containers is not under consideration.</P>

	<P>A code of practice for safety at indoor concerts was published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 1998, providing advice and guidance on the safe organisation and running of indoor concerts. The aim of the code is to help those involved in the organisation of indoor concerts to plan and manage such events safely.</P>
        <P>Under the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended, the person having control over a premises is obliged to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on such premises and to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire. The Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations 1985 require persons in control of premises to ensure all escape routes to a place of safety are kept unobstructed and immediately available for use.</P>
        <P>The Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003 made provision for a new licensing system to be operated by fire authorities for certain large scale indoor events. Discussions with interested parties on the proposed licensing system are at an advanced stage. The 2003 Act also amended and updated the enforcement provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981, making it simpler for fire authorities to prosecute offences and strengthening substantially the inspection and advisory powers of fire authority inspectors.</P>
        <P>The 1981 Act, as amended, gives statutory backing to existing codes of practice on fire and crowd safety. Under section 20A an authorised fire authority inspector may, in addition to inspection and advisory powers, serve a closure notice with immediate effect where a premises poses a serious or immediate risk to the safety of persons on or in the premises. Inspections, including during performance inspections, of places of public resort are undertaken by fire authority inspectors under the Fire Services Act.</P>

	<P>The guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing came into effect on 13 April 2005. The guidelines provide that reasonable proposals on suitable sites in rural areas for persons who are <Col N="343"/>part of, contribute to, or have links with the rural community must be accommodated. The guidelines, therefore, represent a presumption in favour of quality one-off housing for rural communities, as long as proposals meet normal standards in matters such as the proper disposal of wastewater and road safety. Rural areas are defined for the purposes of the guidelines as those areas outside urban areas with a population of 1,500 or more.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>The guidelines are a material consideration for both development plans and in the consideration of planning applications. Planning authorities are required to review and vary their development plans, where necessary, to ensure their policies on rural settlement are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines. The detailed application of the guidelines to particular planning cases is, however, a matter for the planning authority concerned or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate. </P>
