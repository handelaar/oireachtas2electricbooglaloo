	<P>The Taoiseach will recall the sense of outrage that existed at the revelation that the Government proposed to grant early release to the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement that such a deal is off the table and that these persons will serve their full time as handed down by the courts. The Taoiseach will also recall that this crime consisted of the brutal slaying of a Garda on duty for his country, which is a capital offence. In this case, it was reduced to a lesser charge due to intimidation. We have all heard the frequent calls for temporary release of those prisoners involved. From media reports of the report of the inspector of prisons, I understand the killers involved occupy a separate area of the prison compound at Castlerea known as the Grove. The information contained in the inspector&rsquo;s report is very clear that these prisoners appear to operate a veto on the integration process among all prisoners in that prison. Can the Taoiseach confirm if this is the case? When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded in July 2004 to a question by Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, he indicated that he had neither disimproved nor improved the regime, but that he had inherited it. What is the position regarding the activities of the McCabe killers in the running of this prison, including the concern that they are operating a veto? The report of the inspector is very clear that the policy of integration in Unit A is not working, as the provisional IRA prisoners are effectively using a veto over the duties assigned to working prisoners in the Grove. This includes objecting to prisoners serving sentences for sex offences or drugs working in the kitchen or on grounds near the houses they occupy. I have already raised the issue of photographs being taken and the sale of goods abroad with the names of these prisoners thereon. Can the Taoiseach explain the relevance of the newspaper reports today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made my position clear on the prisoners who were involved in the murder <Col N="1322"/>of Jerry McCabe and the wounding of Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan. There has been no change on this in the last six years. In 1999, the Provisional IRA prisoners were moved to the Grove area of Castlerea. It is an open prison, although it is not in any way luxurious. The procedures there are obviously less strict than elsewhere. In all prisons, including Castlerea, it is a matter for the governor to determine the duties of the trustees and how that is handled. I have no news of any change in this. I have heard of reports and I have tried to check on them, but I have been told that it is entirely inaccurate to say that these prisoners are in control of the prison. The murderers of Garda Jerry McCabe are in prison and they will remain there for the duration of their sentences. I have received no information from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or from the governor of the prison, that the circumstances have changed since 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach has been down there or not. There is a 20 foot wall around Castlerea prison and it is a secure facility. This matter was the first item on the agenda in all the discussions that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had with Sinn F&eacute;in representatives. Was the operation of the prison regime regarding these four prisoners ever discussed at any of those meetings? Can the Taoiseach confirm newspaper reports that the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe faxed their requirements to the local shop, which were then delivered by taxi? If the prisoners are exercising a veto over the integration of all prisoners in that complex, has the Taoiseach considered that they should be returned to Portlaoise? What is his response to a remark made by a county councillor in Cavan last night that there would be no decommissioning by the IRA until these prisoners are released?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The prison is secure but the regime is that of an open prison. Since 1970, the prisoners in Portlaoise got different treatment because of their structures. When the prisoners were moved to Castlerea, they continued to receive different treatment. I do not know about the operations regarding their food and so on, but I am told that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Chinese take-aways are doing well at any rate.</P>

	<P>Or porridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am told that it is not a situation of luxury. It is entirely inaccurate to describe the prisoners as being in control of the prison. The governor makes the operational decisions <Col N="1323"/>that he believes are necessary. The only matter discussed with the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership was in regard to the release of the prisoners. That was the only issue that concerned them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears that dozens of child care centres nationally are at risk as a result of the communication on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the equal opportunities child care programme. Staffing grants for child care facilities are to be reviewed after 31 August. I draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention especially to the statement in the communication that the Department wishes the services to be sustainable with effect from 1 September 2005 through a fair and equitable fee structure. In other words, the Department intends that with the exception of those in what it calls &ldquo;gravely disadvantaged areas&rdquo;, a definition the meaning of which is unknown, the grants made available to community-based, not-for-profit child care facilities will be terminated and their sponsors directed to charge economic fees.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know what the imposition of economic fees for child care will mean for parents on middle and lower incomes? Many families on middle incomes pay as much and in some cases more on child care than they do in mortgage repayments. The Taoiseach must know from being out and about at present that people living in the commuter belts around the city find it extremely difficult to source child care facilities and that where they can, fees sometimes exceed mortgage repayments. The little the Government is doing to address child care provision it now proposes to partially discontinue thereby putting dozens of child care centres at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is certainly not what the Government is doing. Our policy is to respond to child care needs by increasing the availability of child care places through the implementation of the national child care strategy in the equal opportunities child care programmes. We also assist parents with the cost of caring for their children through the provision of significantly increased child benefit which supports all parents irrespective of economic status throughout the childhood of their offspring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has no idea of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision was made some years ago that the provision of child benefit in this manner was the fairest approach to take. The equal opportunities child care programme was funded as a key element of the national economic development plan to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 50% to 28,300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bureaucratic nightmare. Community representatives cannot even fill in the forms as they are so difficult.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Funds have been committed to facilitate the creation of 33,000 new places. There are no plans to close centres. We are endeavouring to extend them under the equal opportunities programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>None of the places in question existed a few years ago. They are all new.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no system or order in the provision of child care places. Funding for the equal opportunities programme has increased from an original package of &euro;318 million to &euro;499 million. It is not the Government&rsquo;s policy to reduce places or close centres, it is, rather, to create more places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the staffing grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has no familiarity with the issue. The Government is not aiding child care through what the Taoiseach called &ldquo;equal opportunities child care programmes&rdquo; as there is only one programme, the staffing grants of which he proposes to cut. By falling back on an argument about child benefit, the Taoiseach showed he has no knowledge of the cost of child care. Does the Taoiseach know the average cost of child care in this city and its surrounding areas is &euro;150 per child per week and it is very little different in the rest of the country? In the Book of Estimates for 2005, the Government has frozen the provision for child care.</P>
      <P>While there is no commitment to child care in the programme for Government, the Progressive Democrats promised in its manifesto to provide 40,000 additional child care places. Through its Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the party is actually cutting the number of places which exist. It is a further example of the sort of spin we saw in relation to medical cards. The Progressive Democrats promised 40,000 additional places, but is cutting the number that are there. I cannot for the life of me understand why child care is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I cannot see it being a priority for the Minister. The communication the Department has issued puts at risk dozens of child care facilities, such as they are, around the country.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To repeat a number of points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Answer the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to speak without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to answer Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s questions, not those of his backbenchers. Expenditure on child benefit has increased four fold to assist people with children. I understand its purpose very well. Expenditure has increased from &euro;500 million to &euro;2 billion and it benefits everybody regardless of circumstances. Child care places have been increased by over 50%. When the approved additional resources are implemented, 33,000 places will be provided. Deputy Rabbitte is only wrong on one fact, which is that child care is far more expensive than he states. For one child the cost is from &euro;800 to &euro;900 per month, including in Kildare and Meath as he will have heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was acknowledged in numerous reports that the fairest approach with the best socio-economic impact was to provide child benefit to everyone regardless of income. There are still significant difficulties for young families, especially those with mortgages, whether they are in the commuter belt or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Government cutting the staffing grants then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue has already been identified as one to be dealt with in the next round of negotiations with the social partners. We should avoid glib comments to the effect that an increase from &euro;500 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to &euro;2 billion is nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I note in today&rsquo;s newspapers the penitential experience of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, who was stuck at the Blanchardstown by-pass. He has my sympathies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he pay his toll?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not clear that the rail line to Navan is overdue and must be constructed? The line should be built all the way to Navan rather than provided on a phased basis to Dunboyne. Will the Taoiseach act on the promise to construct the line? Fianna F&aacute;il was elected in 2002 on the basis of a manifesto which promised the provision of new regional and commuter routes including a Dublin-Navan rail line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Clonsilla.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1326"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The manifesto referred to a Dublin-Navan line. It should be provided on the basis of the prioritisation of the reinstatement of the former inland rail route from Navan to Dublin in the 1994 Dublin transportation initiative, the 1999 strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area and the DTO Platform for Change of September 2000. According to the DTO Platform for Change, a new rail spur was to be constructed off the Maynooth line near Clonsilla via Dunboyne to Navan by 2010 in three stages. Planning and design of the Navan line to railway order stage was to have been completed by 2003, construction of the line from Clonsilla to Dunboyne by 2006 and the extension to Navan by 2010.</P>
      <P>It is time to apologise for the foot-dragging and face up to the promises that have been made and the series of reports which state this must be done immediately. The Government should do so now rather than wait for the by-election to make a new announcement when it was already on the cards and promised and on which the Government was elected on the basis of delivering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have put &euro;1.2 billion into different aspects of rail transport. Two weeks ago Deputy Higgins asked me about the Clonsilla to Dunboyne line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was asked about the Navan line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s question regarding the Clonsilla to Dunboyne&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not ask the Taoiseach about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach get around to answering the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy submitted his question to the Taoiseach and was heard without interruption. The Taoiseach must have the same courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>His own Deputy mentioned two phases. One must start with the first stage before getting to the last stage. We are not building with Lego.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Studies have been finished regarding the Clonsilla to Dunboyne line, the situation is well advanced and planning is almost certain to go ahead. The next stage, the feasibility study, is being undertaken. That has only started and will look at extending the line more broadly to Navan. Of course it makes sense ultimately to extend the line to Navan, but the first part of the <Col N="1327"/>process is the line to Dunboyne and that will hopefully get underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not detect from the Taoiseach any level of urgency about the matter. He says it is a good idea, and we can all speak about good ideas. However, the Government is in place to act, particularly on its promises and manifesto. Will that happen with regard to the Navan line, not just as far as Dunboyne? CSO figures published last year showed Navan as the fastest-growing large town in the State between 1996 and 2001. Its population increased by 51.6%, which is almost 20,000 people, while overall State figures increased by 8%. In that regard, will the Taoiseach initiate the Navan project? Will he state it as the Navan line rather than phase one? Will he say it is the Navan line, and will it be delivered by 2010? This is what people need to know, given that they are investing, and will hopefully continue to invest, in Navan. They need to know if the service will be there.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned cost. A study by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann showed the Maynooth to Clonsilla line cost &euro;156 million. Road building will cost between &euro;15 billion and &euro;20 billion and will be announced sometime in March. Can we compare like with like and give a fair allocation to the rail programme so that the line will be built to Navan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No Government has ever put as much money into transport infrastructure as we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has invested in roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Over &euro;1.2 billion has been invested in rail transport. The logical position is to build the line to Navan. The first stage is the Clonsilla to Dunboyne line. The studies have been done and completed, the Government is supportive of it and we want to get on with it. Some &euro;31 billion has been allocated to the transport programme until 2009.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all for roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not all for roads. The Midleton line which helps over 100,000 commuters is going ahead and is well underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind members of the Green Party that the Taoiseach is entitled to make his reply without interruption. If the Deputy has any respect for his leader, he will allow him to answer without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is beyond Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s wildest dreams.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1328"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyle got upset when I said the Midleton line was underway. He obviously does not want it to be underway so he got upset at the reference. The feasibility study of the Navan line has commenced and hopefully we will get that back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When did the Taoiseach last use the train?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent might, on another occasion, tell me when we will also get the N3. His view is that we will have the rail line sooner than the N3.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I met with representatives from the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly on 18 November 2004. The meeting allowed for useful discussion on issues of particular importance in the region. In general terms, these included progress on the implementation of the national development plan, especially by reference to the key objectives of more balanced regional development and the funding position of the region post-2006. My Department will remain in contact with the regional assembly and will keep me informed of any developments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is not unlike my previous question. Did the Taoiseach indicate to the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly whether he would act on his 2002 com<Col N="1329"/>mitment to provide a western rail corridor? Is that the current Government position or has it changed? There has been a change with regard to carbon tax, even though it was in the manifesto. Is the western rail corridor on line to be built?</P>
        <P>The group probably raised the need for a spur link to Shannon Airport. Is that part of the thinking in terms of the western rail corridor? Given that the line is already in place, to a large extent, has the projected rise in population from 480,000 to 620,000 being served by the line been taken into account? Will the Government give a timeframe for its implementation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware of the study of the western rail corridor. The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, set up a group in conjunction with the western corridor group to conduct a full study which will be available in April. I am not sure whether that addresses the issue of Shannon, but I met members of the group a few months ago and the study certainly covers the full link of the 12 or 15 towns involved. The expert group which has carried out the professional study will produce its report in mid-April.</P>

	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The BMW region is given Objective One status for the purposes of making it a priority for infrastructure spend and decisiveness on the part of Government. The Taoiseach mentioned earlier that &euro;1.2 billion is left aside for rail transport. I strongly support the western rail corridor. Over the past 25 years members of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party at county council level have been very diligent, along with all parties, in retaining the land and line and that is of great value. I would like the Taoiseach to say that he supports the opening of the corridor from Sligo southwards. The engineers who do this tell me they could actually complete the business inside two years. Is that part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s thinking regarding Sligo to Ennis? The survey only covers a particular section of that. The Government should give the matter its full support.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach have information on the spend or allocation to Knock Airport? It is of international size.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions of a detailed nature would be more appropriate to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle has had occasion to fly into Knock, which is in the heart of the BMW region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government support the airport as a central part of infrastructure for the BMW region?</P><Col N="1330"/>
        <P>Was the issue of the N4 and N5 discussed with the Taoiseach and his delegation? There was a certain development in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a separate question for the Minister for Transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The N4 and N5 are the main roads to the west. The section through R&aacute;th Cruach&aacute;n near Tulsk presents a problem in terms of archaeology.</P>
        <P>There is &euro;640 million of an underspend in the BMW region. Can the Taoiseach spur on the appropriate Ministers to make decisions where projects are ready to proceed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to answer all those questions, although I may not have all the details. I am supportive of the western rail corridor but where it starts and finishes depends on the studies that are being undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to hear that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It would make sense to use the existing rail lines but we will have to await the completion of the studies in order to ascertain the viability of the various issues. When I met representatives of the groups involved, they told me they knew there were issues concerning the viability of all the lines. It is important to be supportive of it. As we all know, rail makes enormous sense and that is why we have been putting a huge amount of resources into railway infrastructure.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The purpose of the ten-year envelope is to try to get order into the planning process. We are spending twice the EU average on infrastructure and have argued strongly about the need for this with the European Commission. We will do so again in the next round, even though we will probably get far less money. We had underspends for decades and nobody solved them. I have argued that the country did not have the money at the time and I have given the figures to the European Commission. While we are spending more now, we need to do so.</P>
        <P>We are not getting the required level of private sector investment in these projects. They will argue all day about what would happen if the public-private partnership system was easier to implement. To be frank, however, having listened to all the arguments, I do not think they want to get into PPPs. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is looking at this matter afresh to see what other way we can approach it. Even in the United Kingdom they are pulling back on public-private partnerships. With less money from the European Union and less private sector involvement &mdash; unless they change their attitude to these issues &mdash; the State will have to fund this. The ten-year programme makes logical sense and obviously within that programme there will be priorities. The necessary infrastructure includes <Col N="1331"/>railways and linking roads to the main towns, including those in the west.</P>
        <P>We are endeavouring to finish some of the very big infrastructural projects which will release funds. We are getting very close to the end of the Dublin to the Border route on the Dundalk line, which will be totally finished at Easter. The Dundalk by-pass at Ballymascanlon is underway. The Dublin Port tunnel will finish around Christmas, although it may go into early 2006 for testing. However, we are on the last year of big expenditure for that project. The same is the case with the road going south. As the Minister, Deputy Cowen, said, some of those resources should then be released. That is why the decisions on half the projects this year are in the BMW region &mdash; some seven of the 12 projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Nine of the 12 projects are in the west. It was a positive decision to do that. As the Deputy knows, we have difficulties on a few of the other major projects we wanted to start because of environmental issues but rather than arguing about them we will invest moneys in other areas. That is the plan. The ten-year programme certainly allows us to make progress.</P>
        <P>As we finish some major road projects on the east coast, &euro;1.4 billion is being spent on infrastructural resources for roads this year alone. As everyone can see, therefore, a huge investment is being made in this catch-up phase.</P>
        <P>We have now outlined what roads are to be completed this year, which will be started, which are in the final stages of tendering and which are at the planning and development phase, including compulsory purchase orders. I admit it has taken a few years to get to this stage. I have chaired the relevant committee and it has not always been easy to bring order to the process. However, there is now a clear structure within the Departments, the National Roads Authority and the local authorities. The planning process has been outlined in an ordered way right up to 2015.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ongoing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenge for the State is to keep such expenditure at 5% to 6% of GDP. Recently, the engineers said that regardless of what happens to the economy we should be able to do that. I do not think any politician &mdash; certainly not myself, or any Taoiseach &mdash; would make that claim. If we can do it, however, there is agreement that in 2015 we could have a very modern system. It will have to continue in that order. I have put much effort in that committee into getting a long-term, ordered plan, otherwise we would just keep ticking away and would never get there in anybody&rsquo;s lifetime. There is now a good structure in place in the Department, the National Roads Authority and the local auth<Col N="1332"/>orities, which communicate and work together, which is a good system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach forgot to mention the central infrastructural element, which is Knock Airport where there are serious plans for expansion. I know the airport has received some money but the Taoiseach might comment on that matter. It is close to everybody&rsquo;s heart in the sense that it provides real potential for future development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have given Knock Airport &euro;3 million which is part of what it requires. It is the biggest slice that any such project has received, although I know the airport is seeking more. I have spoken to the airport&rsquo;s representatives twice in the past six months. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has provided the allocation of &euro;3 million. I agree that the potential is there. It is the only investment opportunity to get a really good strategic development in that area. When the IDA meets with business groups, they all mention Knock Airport as a key facility. It is obviously correct to support the airport&rsquo;s ongoing development given its potential for attracting companies to the region. I do not know what overall expenditure the airport&rsquo;s representatives are seeking but they have been given &euro;3 million to get on with some of the works they want to undertake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to revert to some of the points that have been raised. Currently, the Taoiseach, in common with the rest of us in the House, is experiencing the problems that have come with the explosion of development in Dublin, which has spilled over into neighbouring counties. There is a serious grievance at the other end of the country about the degree of underspending of such moneys as have been allocated. I want to ask the Taoiseach specifically about the western rail corridor. I heard the Taoiseach make positive noises, as the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, did also. I have not noticed the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, do so yet, although he may have made positive noises. The people who are concerned about this matter want to see something tangible at this stage. They want to know if there is any reality behind the positive noises. Where are the reports that have been undertaken? In the Government&rsquo;s view, where is the presentation by the group lobbying for the western rail corridor deficient, if it is deficient? That group has been in existence for some time. Are there particular aspects of the presentation that need to be firmed up before a decision will be made? When is it likely that a decision will be made, albeit a partial decision on a phased basis? Will the Taoiseach indicate an approximate schedule for such a decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the report by the chairman will be ready in April. The Minister, <Col N="1333"/>Deputy Cullen, tells me he believes it will be in early April. We have been supportive of this all the way through. The report is to identify how it can best be achieved. There will probably be arguments about the viability of where the western rail corridor starts and ends. I have heard the arguments about whether Sligo is the best location, as Deputy Kenny said, but I am not an expert in such matters. As much as we can, it makes sense to support and engage in what is viable, based on expert advice. The finances for it are already with the Department and, from presentations we have received, I know it will be part of the ten-year rail plan. Therefore, provision has already been made for it. What is not clear from the discussions is where they should start, where it is viable and where it is not viable. It has been stated that technically the way to return to a proper rail link in the west is to proceed on a phased basis. I accept the Deputy is correct. I have not heard anybody being negative about the concept in the presentations I have heard in recent years. The only argument has been about where, when and what adds up. There is a real opportunity to get it done on a phased basis. The report which is due some time before the summer will come back with recommendations from the Department to the committee and then we will have to make a decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach speak in general about the current state of the decentralisation programme? A number of those towns were due to benefit from some element of decentralisation. Will they have to wait a while longer than was envisaged in the precipitative announcement by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, or is it that some of them are off the map entirely?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be more appropriate to table detailed questions to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a general question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally the policy is that 10,300 public servants will move to the 50-plus locations in 24 counties. The process will take longer than originally envisaged. The OPW and the group working on decentralisation have divided the move into three blocks. One block will move with the greatest speed. Regarding the second block, in some areas they are down to a number of sites and locations in terms of building offices. The third block is further back. They have not been able to advance it.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation group will make its second report some time in spring. The end of April was the date that was originally agreed. I presume that will not change because of the difficulties with the chairman. That was the date it was working towards and I cannot see why it cannot be achieved. The third category is not off the map but clearly it will take longer to complete that phase.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I note from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s earlier reply to this series of questions that he has agreed that the single biggest issue of concern to people in the BMW region is infrastructure in all its aspects. Can I deduce from what the Taoiseach said that he accepts that people in our region are rightly concerned that despite Objective One status, the promised peace dividend and the establishment of a regional assembly that the entire region, especially the Border counties, feel they are being left far behind the east and the south of the island in terms of infrastructural development?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach advise what steps he is prepared to take? He indicated some intent of redressing the imbalance in terms of major projects to be undertaken. Will he outline what further steps he is prepared to take to address this imbalance to ensure the Border counties, the midlands and the west will get their fair share, not only on a continuum but in terms of the catch-up and what is overdue in addressing the imbalance in investment that has taken place over a considerable period? What action will the Taoiseach take to remedy it and will the Government instruct, advise or encourage the NRA to ensure that in its particular area of responsibility projects earmarked for the BMW region will be given priority in the coming years?</P>
        <P>What steps can be taken to ensure that there is a significant improvement in the roll-out of broadband into the BMW region?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is more appropriate to the line Minister responsible for broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an aspect of infrastructure no different to roads or rail. Broadband is infrastructure. Will the Taoiseach give an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent in regard to addressing the deficiency in broadband access in the BMW region? Specifically in my county and that of the Ceann Comhairle, what is the status of the towns of Castleblaney and Clones?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough. That is a more specific question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach cannot be expected to have details of every town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am using it as an example of Border towns that have known only disadvantage and marginalisation over many years. What does the Taoiseach propose to do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The roll-out of broadband has intensified greatly in the 19 towns that were originally identified. It has continued into the next 38 towns and it will continue to be rolled out in up to 100 towns. There are also community broadband schemes. There has been an enormous acceler<Col N="1335"/>ation of that activity. Eircom and others had reduced their programme because of losses on the 3G licence issue but they are back in again and have been working with the Minister. There has been a significant intensification of the roll-out programme, particularly into smaller towns. It is a positive story this year. The Minister gave a detailed statement in regard to it. The programme has been accelerated and is on track. A great deal of work was done last year. The same is true of this calendar year.</P>
        <P>The economic and social infrastructure operational programme is large. There has been an enormous increase in the intended expenditure. Far more is being spent than was estimated. It is not a question of spending falling behind the projections.</P>
        <P>We want to achieve balanced regional development and an equality of expenditure between the southern and eastern region and the BMW region. The BMW region fell behind because of a few major projects. I think I said nine out of 12 projects to Deputy Kenny earlier when I should have said nine out of 18. We have now given priority to the BMW region for starts last year, this year and next year. Once the three projects to which I referred earlier are completed we can continue to do more in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Some of the major projects elsewhere are of equal benefit to the BMW region. Deputy Kenny made the point earlier about some of the roads. The Kinnegad bypass, which is a major project, is of great benefit to everybody in the country, as is the case with most such developments. The Loughrea bypass is under way and the Ballinasloe bypass is in the final stages of planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Slane Bridge is another example.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle would not be against those projects either. Significant <Col N="1336"/>resources are being invested in these projects. The Exchequer has provided &euro;1.8 billion more than was planned for these developments. While investment in the BMW region has been behind target in the first part of the plan, particularly in the roads programme, expenditure in the region has accelerated according to last year&rsquo;s figures. Eight new projects are about to commence between now and 1 May. We are beginning to see a catch-up in that investment. From the lists of roads issued last week Members can see how much has been achieved in that area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the work that has commenced on the N2. I hope it will continue. It is proof of what is needed in the BMW region. The Belturbet bypass on the N3 is urgently required.</P>

	<P>Does the Deputy have a question? I point out to Deputies that 63 questions have been tabled to the Taoiseach on the Order Paper. We have been dealing with five questions for the past half hour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first time I have had the chance to ask the Taoiseach a question. I am sorry for annoying the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Members to confine themselves to questions of a general nature to the Taoiseach rather than detailed questions which should be asked of line Ministers. Otherwise, we will never get through the 63 questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the Ceann Comhairle will not do down his constituency colleague.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>If we got through the 63 questions, it would be the first time ever.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that INTERREG, PEACE II and IFI funds are often used as in substitution rather than comprising additional money for the BMW region? This is why people in the BMW region are angry at the &euro;640 million shortfall of spending in the region. Will the Taoiseach make every effort during the remainder of the period in which the is money available to make sure that the bias is in favour of the BMW and that the money allocated to it is actually spent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford is correct that the money should be additional rather than being used in substitution for other funds. The funds from PEACE II, INTERREG and the peace dividend were meant to be additional funds for the region. I had an interesting discussion the other day with an individual who complained to me about traffic in the Meath constituency. In his next breath he complained about decentralisation. I had great difficulty in relating to him that the decentralisation of jobs could solve the traffic <Col N="1337"/>problems. Unfortunately, he did not agree with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach get the vote?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would probably not have got it anyway. It was an interesting discussion when one considers the logic of a public servant driving to the city and being against decentralisation.</P>
        <P>The economic and social structure of the programme originally had a ratio of 27:73; that of employment in human resources development was 29:71; the productive sector was 36:64 and for technical assistance the ratio was 38:62. Under the PEACE II programme, all the funds went to the BMW region. The actual figures for the ratio at the mid-point were 22:78, which indicates that the Border region slipped 5%. The ratio for employment was 29:71, which figure was planned and on target. The productive sector ratio was 24:76, which represented the largest drop. However, the other ratios were all on target. Sometimes the position is put that all the ratios fell behind. I accept there are areas in which they did, but not to the extent suggested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It must have moved to Louth or Strangford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It moved around the areas.</P>
        <P>Last Monday, the additional contract was signed for the Dundalk-Newry road and the continuation of the M1 which, I hope, will develop further. All the economic analysis indicates that business in the Border region is still only 25% to 30% of what it would be between two regions if it had not been for the conflicts of the past. Border Deputies know better than I that business investors have continually stated that the quality of the transport network presented them with problems. However, the opposite is now the case because, as Deputies know, the journey time between Dublin and Belfast is much shorter, even keeping well within the law. This will be improved further after the Ballymascanlon and Dundalk bypasses are complete. The contract for the M1 into Newry was also signed the other day, the completion of which will make an enormous difference. In the normal course of investment, this should represent a major improvement, as was stated to me in a recent meeting with the chamber of commerce in Dundalk and with the Newry and Mourne chamber of commerce late last year. They all state that these developments will lead to greater investment and I hope they do.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s point that Monaghan has for a long time relied on its indigenous industries of furniture, mushrooms and so on and has not received the kind of inward investment that would have made a difference. However, the difference in prices and travel times on that road should make an enormous difference and I hope that comes to pass. It now represents some of the country&rsquo;s best infrastructure.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise this question will require more attention from the Minister for Transport. However, in regard to his discussions with the BMW regional assembly, will the Taoiseach inform the House whether the Government is willing to progress a development whereby a rail line might be built alongside a new road being constructed, for example, between Sligo and Bundoran, in order to take advantage of the reservation acquisition there? Opportunities such as this may arise and could form part of an ongoing plan. Given the congestion in Galway, Sligo and so on which adversely affects 85% of businesses, is it envisaged that will we make progress in this manner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy correctly anticipated, the question is more appropriate to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that all the major Gaeltacht areas, namely, Mayo, Donegal and Galway, are within the BMW region, is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has signed the order for the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta election on Friday, which has disadvantaged a large number of people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>In reply to Deputy Sargent, we are committed to infrastructure in the west, whether that involves road or rail, but the projects must be viable. It is one thing to construct rail lines but they must be viable. Rail is already <Col N="1339"/>a huge loss-maker, which one must accept because it is a good transport system. I am not aware of the example to which the Deputy referred but one cannot construct such lines unless there is at least a reasonable flow, otherwise they would become very costly. However, where there is a reasonable flow that is a different matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11 together.</P>
        <P>The meeting of the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs scheduled for January was amalgamated with the most recent meeting on 2 February. The reason is that important preparatory work in one of the principle agenda items, namely, strategic national infrastructure, was still ongoing when the January meeting was scheduled to have taken place. It is expected that the Government will formally consider the outputs of that work in the very near future. The other main agenda item was the national spatial strategy with an emphasis on progress to date and plans for the year.</P>
        <P>A further meeting of the team is being held today. Agenda items are: housing, particularly in the context of recent reports from the National Economic and Social Council and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution; stra<Col N="1340"/>tegic national infrastructure, especially proposals to expedite delivery; and the transport investment programme under the ten year envelope.</P>
        <P>In general terms, the team and the Cabinet committee to which it reports serve a valuable role in progressing and resolving issues related to infrastructural planning and delivery. To that end the team continued to make a major contribution throughout last year and met on ten separate occasions. I have reported to the House separately on those meetings.</P>
        <P>Overall, the team has helped to improve significantly the context for the delivery of national infrastructure, especially in terms of time and cost. A particularly important feature of the team&rsquo;s work last year was related to the roll out of the multi-annual financial envelopes for the various broad categories of infrastructure activity. The House can be assured that the team will continue to make an important contribution throughout this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach expect that the national development programme will be completed on time? How far off schedule does he expect it to be given the remarks made recently by the Institution of Engineers of Ireland with regard to the multi-annual funding network which was announced? Does the Taoiseach expect to have it completed within the time limit or will it be off schedule by three to five years?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned there is a meeting today about housing. I am sure the Taoiseach has had his eyes opened, as many other Deputies have had, by the huge conurbations outside the city in Meath and Kildare. The clumping of huge housing estates without infrastructure is a social crime of enormous consequence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a question on the cross-departmental team which the Taoiseach will deal with on the housing issue. My question is valid in that sense. Does that committee discuss the concept of housing whereby if 1,000 or 2,000 houses are to be built in a certain place, there will be a concurrent proposal to construct the schools, leisure facilities, playgrounds and so forth, so those who pay their deposit in the first instance can know in advance the bus routes and public facilities that will be available? I have seen some of these estates in the last few weeks and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, Deputy Kenny, these are questions for the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, you have become very tetchy in the last couple of days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking a question about a cross-departmental team dealing with housing. Is anything wrong with that?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The details of what is discussed at the cross-departmental committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Did I mention any specific location? I mentioned housing as a concept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Each Minister is responsible for their line Department in the areas for which they have responsibility. The Taoiseach is not specifically responsible for these detailed questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not suggest he was. I asked the Taoiseach if the cross-departmental team dealing with housing discusses such issues. This is about people and their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The details of what it discusses is not appropriate under these questions. The Deputy&rsquo;s question asked about the meeting of the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships and asked the Taoiseach to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is part of it. You, a Cheann Comhairle, no longer need to canvass because of your privileged position here but if you had been in some of the housing estates I have been in during the last couple of weeks, you would understand what I am saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have put down my question to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, these issues are discussed in various fora, not just in the committee. The reason for national planning, balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy, on which we worked over the last few years, was to deal with the type of issues mentioned by the Deputy. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is currently developing terms of reference for a study of the needs of gateways. That proposal has been approved by the cross-departmental team and it is anticipated the project will be completed by the middle of this year.</P>
        <P>A few things have happened. One is the impact of the national development plan projects in overcoming infrastructure barriers. There are also the strategic infrastructural requirements of the gateway areas. The reason the national spatial strategy provided that all local authorities must have regional planning guidelines was to deal with the issue raised by the Deputy. They must examine how development is conducted. I have seen some of these developments. They provide grand housing but there were no regional planning guidelines in the past. However, they are now in place and people must consider from the start of the development where the school, community centre and so forth will be.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte is probably far more knowledgeable than I about what happened in the <Col N="1342"/>Tallaght and Clondalkin area 30 years ago, when that mistake was made. It would be regrettable if we were still making the same mistake. We had to go back into those areas and provide schools, playgrounds and parks 30 years later. Of course, that turned the community around. Nowadays, developments are being built in areas where there is no problem with open space &mdash; if anything, in some cases they are being built on too open a space &mdash; so I cannot understand why they cannot get the school right.</P>
        <P>Out of curiosity, I checked a few developments in recent days to find out if it was a case of the Department of Education and Science messing up. However, I discovered that in many cases the places were opened before the applications were even put forward. To be frank, it is just bad organisation in planning development. I accept that councillors work hard. There is a planned new development in Navan of approximately 1,200 houses. Last week I looked at a plan shown to me by the chairman of a community council and I discussed it will Deputy Cullen. Nobody could find any road other than the existing one. I was never an engineer and I would not be much good if I ever tried to study for that profession but if one is building 1,200 houses, it is a basic requirement to provide a road from it to the main road and not use a road that is already overcrowded. This is basic stuff.</P>
        <P>Colleagues have told me that the answer to this is the regional planning guidelines. In the context of the national spatial strategy and the gateways, the purpose and logic of why the technical people have argued about ways to do this is to ensure that planning is dealt with in a far broader way. It is not an issue of putting 600 or 1,000 houses in Mornington or any of the other areas we have visited recently and then, when they are half built, to consider building a school given that there might be children in the houses. If the development is taking four or five years, it should be done in a better way.</P>
        <P>I have also seen areas where that was done well, often because of good public representatives or councillors. These people were often berated because they wanted to get the development right and argued for it. Many local authorities oblige developers to make a contribution. There was a row in the House a few years ago about these contributions. However, it should not be a cost that is passed on. If the prices we hear one can get for houses are correct, the cost of the contribution should not be added to the price of the house. We argued about this and urban development costs in the House. The developer should be able to fund a contribution to the schools, roads and other facilities out of the huge profits. Local authorities are seeking this for the last three or four years, and so they should. It was argued in the House that it would just be put onto the price of houses. However, with the size of some of these estates, the developer has six or seven years work and is making an enormous profit so he has an obligation to pay towards <Col N="1343"/>development costs, probably even more than the existing amounts.</P>
        <P>I did not notice that in the Institution of Engineers of Ireland report or a suggestion of what we should do. I accept many of the points the institution makes but developers should pay towards development costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments but I am not sure it is happening in practice. While we are swapping anecdotes, one community in Meath told me that the site for the school is designated and, after it is rezoned, the Department must buy it back at the rezoned value. If that type of thing happens, it is extraordinary. I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments about the experience of the western towns.</P>
        <P>I was in Sallins recently where people told me there is a big problem with the primary school and that their three and four year old children cannot be enrolled in secondary school. Is it not the case that there is no secondary school available? Naas CBS cannot take them so parents are presented with private education in Newbridge as the only prospect. As Deputy Kenny said, there is an amazing deficit in facilities in this area of developmental explosion of recent years. Is a significant number of projects contemplated as a result of ironing out the difficulties with public private partnerships? The Committee of Public Accounts heard some time ago that such moneys as had been made available from the pension reserve fund for infrastructure projects had not been called on and no projects have been brought forward despite the manifest requirement.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny dealt with another matter. The report from the Institution of Engineers of Ireland is far more critical than one would divine from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response. Did the experts who compiled that report suggest we are not within a mile of hitting the national development plan target because we are so far behind today?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about past schemes, a process is now in place in regard to the gateways, hubs and regional planning guidelines. With many developments of the past year or two, the developer simply gave the land site as part of the development, which is what should happen. The Deputy is correct in regard to other cases in older developments where this was not part of the overall development. In these cases, the State has not got the sites and people will obviously try to zone the sites to sell them to the State at a higher cost. However, if it was done as part of the regional planning guidelines at the commencement, the State should not pay anything for these sites; it should be part of the overall development. That is happening and there are many good examples of vigilant public representatives of all political parties co-operating to achieve this. This is the way it should be but, unfortunately, guidelines were not in place previously and developers were able to push these developments through, <Col N="1344"/>probably by applying pressure, without making much contribution, such as providing some open space. The regional planning guidelines will force that to change.</P>
        <P>I accept many of the positive points made in the report of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland. We have invested hundreds of millions of euro more than was planned in the national development plan, yet there are areas where we are behind. The institution correctly identifies some of these areas. Where did the money go? In many cases, it was eaten up due to under estimation, changes to the design of projects, cost inflation and also engineer&rsquo;s inflation. Many of these factors have caused resources to be used up and, therefore, we are behind in some areas.</P>
        <P>In other cases, however, we have gone beyond the national development plan. For example, the multi-annual envelopes for 2005 to 2009 will see approximately &euro;33.4 billion invested in the capital programme, which must be factored in. However, the institution makes positive suggestions.</P>
        <P>A section of the National Treasury Management Agency is considering the issue of public private partnership. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has, to his credit, given much time since the budget to consideration of this area. He is considering changes to structures and spent a whole day with people involved in PPP, listening to their cases and to what they think is wrong, to find if there is some other way we can make the system work.</P>
        <P>With regard to some major projects, I have tried to achieve private sector engagement but it is not easy. Some say the process does not work and when one tries to get the private sector to organise a major project, one does not get the feeling the sector is clear on the idea. Some projects around Dublin city would be ideal if the private sector was prepared to take them over, for example, the completion by tunnel of the M50 going south. This project would probably cost well over &euro;1 billion if the private sector wanted to take it up, and it would not go wrong if it wanted it for 30 or 40 years. However, the private sector tends to pull away from these projects.</P>
        <P>The State will never be able to complete all of these projects. Therefore, we must find some imaginative way of involving the pension fund in this. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, is working on this at present.</P>
        <P>The private sector has become involved in the M50 project and some other projects. However, it should take the really big money. We will not need the pension fund money for 20 to 25 years. My view, given the demographics, is that we will not need it for far longer. I do not understand how, on one side, some say we will need it in the years 2025 to 2030 and, on the other side, some say there will be 1 million extra people at that time. I do not believe this doomsday scenario will happen.</P>
        <P>We should be able put aside more of this money. The pension fund managers will invest the resources but it must be a private sector <Col N="1345"/>driven project. I have yet to see someone coming forward with a vehicle that will lead to this. However, having listened to what the people say they need, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, is reconsidering the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Taoiseach had his Duracells changed this morning. On an area that was not addressed, has the cross-departmental team with responsibility for housing considered the issue of housing in the private rented sector? Is the Taoiseach aware that the number of households in receipt of rent supplement now exceeds 40% of the entire private rented sector? This is a statistic learned from a recent Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Does the Taoiseach accept it is clear these people should be accommodated within the social rented sector as the State is massively subsidising the private rented sector, and this statistic only underscores it? Will the Taoiseach reply to the specifics of my questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We often warn in this House of the danger of moneylenders and loan sharks. Is the Taoiseach alarmed that some PPPs are much more expensive than the public sector component? The Kilcock-Kinnegad section, for example, cost &euro;1.1 million less per kilometre than the private sector section of that project. Is there any measure to end this type of gross profiteering from the private sector? How will a PPP work, for example, in regard to building, as proposed by Government, a prison on the Dublin-Meath border? Will it be responsible for security and maintenance or just for construction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>While the committee does not deal with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question, generally, the private rented sector is an important part of housing policy. The changes we have introduced in that area have significantly reduced the private sector rented market. It is continuing to decline dramatically, even in the heart of Dublin, which is a major change. If many in that sector could access affordable or social housing, it is undoubted they would be happier. However, the State is subsidising them in accommodation, in many cases where they are happiest and from where they do not want to move. It is not one size fits all.</P>
        <P>There are many arguments about PPPs which time does not permit me to go into. However, another argument suggests that PPP projects are coming in on cost and on or ahead of time &mdash; the Monasterevin bypass was nearly a year ahead and the Kinnegad project is going well. There are efficiencies of scale and there will also be efficiencies in regard to maintenance. While cost is a factor, if one was to wait to undertake projects in the traditional way, there would be increased delays and difficulties. We are spending increased resources in recent years &mdash;&euro;1.4 billion on roads and &euro;1.2 billion on rail, and we must <Col N="1346"/>find the most effective way of completing projects which does not only concern cost.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am pleased to introduce the Bill, which provides for the amendment of the Health Act 1970 to address two substantive matters: the provision of a legal framework for the charging of patients for the maintenance element of inpatient services in publicly funded long-term care residential units and the introduction of doctor visit medical cards. The Government has introduced the legislation to establish a sound legal basis for the policy of requiring a contribution towards shelter and maintenance of people with full eligibility in the long-term stay institutions.</P>
      <P>Succeessive Governments have supported and implemented this policy. The Supreme Court recently confirmed it is constitutionally sound for the Oireachtas to legislate for this policy. The issue is finally being put beyond legal doubt after almost 29 years. We are also proposing the introduction of a doctor visit medical card as announced at the publication of the 2005 Estimates. This fulfils a key Government commitment to ensure people on low incomes have access to general practitioner services and advice. It is most efficient to address both issues in the same Bill.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Supreme Court on 16 February 2005 in the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 has brought clarity and finality to the issue of long stay charges. It has also paved the way for the introduction of this Bill to provide the legal basis for charging for inpatient services in publicly funded long stay institutions. We had a full debate in the House on the Supreme Court decision two weeks ago. The court found the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for prospective charging of inpatients were not repugnant to the Consti<Col N="1353"/>tution. There is no constitutional prohibition on implementing a charge into the future for public long stay inpatient services.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts fully that the Supreme Court found the retrospective provisions of that Bill on making lawful the imposition and payment of such charges in the past to be unconstitutional, in so far as this concerns the property rights of citizens. We are concerned with the implementation of policy going forward. I do not believe the House needs to revisit the debate we had two weeks ago on the Supreme Court decision. The debate should focus on the Bill&rsquo;s provisions and look forward to the clarity and benefits they will bring.</P>
      <P>The principle that it is fair and reasonable that most people should make a contribution to the cost of their long stay care is a significant and long standing feature of our system of publicly funded long-term care. This has been restated and reinforced in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You. It is recognised that quality care is expensive and the bulk of the cost of providing a high standard of quality care should be borne by the Exchequer. It is estimated the charges imposed on those in public nursing homes represent approximately 10% of the overall cost of care. It, therefore, represents a modest contribution towards the total cost of treatment and maintenance.</P>
      <P>The services provided to people in long stay care are a valuable part of the health services. It is essential that these services should be protected and maintained. The charges in question are embraced by the concept of a co-payment, which is common throughout the health service. This is consistent with the overall principle that where individuals can contribute a modest amount to the cost of their care, it is reasonable that they do so. Other examples include the inpatient overnight hospital levy. In the latter case, the charge is &euro;55 per night subject to a maximum of &euro;550 in any 12 consecutive months. Those availing of private or semi-private accommodation in public hospitals are also charged.</P>
      <P>I refer to future services for older people specifically. It has been the policy of successive Governments to endeavour to help older people maintain themselves in the community while at the same time providing for residential care which is not prohibitively expensive. The policy of the Government on the development and delivery of services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies. People are much happier in their own homes and they recover more quickly from illness in their own environment and we will continue to allow that to happen in so far as that is possible.</P>
      <P>The roles of all community care services are, therefore, vital to the implementation of this policy. The charges provided for in the legislation will assist in providing funds to help in the implementation of these overall policy objectives in the <Col N="1354"/>future. On foot of advice sought by the T&aacute;naiste from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Health and Children issued a letter on 9 December 2004 to the chief executive officers of the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority asking them to stop making such charges immediately, pending the introduction of amending legislation. It is estimated that this is costing approximately &euro;2 million per week. Accordingly, a statutory framework that puts the long-standing policy on a sound and statutory legal footing and safeguards the income generated from this source is vital. The provisions of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005 will secure this source of income. Let us remember that this income is applied exclusively towards health services. It does not revert to the general Exchequer. It is part and parcel of health funding and has been so for decades past.</P>
      <P>On 18 November 2004, in conjunction with the publication of the 2005 Estimates, the T&aacute;naiste announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce a doctor-visit medical card for 200,000 people. This was the most efficient way to help the most people to access primary care. It is in line with the commitment contained in the health strategy to ensure that the allocation of medical cards is on the basis of prioritising groups most in need. This is one of a package of developments that we have announced regarding the medical card scheme. The others involve adjustments to the income guidelines in respect of standard medical cards which will enable 30,000 additional people to obtain such a medical card in the current year. The new income guidelines have been in force since January 2005. Those guidelines reflect the 7.5% increase on the 2004 figures, as announced in November 2004, and include substantial increases in respect of dependent children.</P>
      <P>Parents of children with illnesses that persist from year to year can be assured that they will not have to reapply for a medical card each year, thus alleviating the anxiety of wondering if their medical card will continue. It is intended that this arrangement should apply to a small number of children with very serious illnesses, where a review would normally result in automatic renewal of the medical card. As I stated, the Government is providing extra resources for additional medical cards in a way which benefits as many people on lower incomes as possible.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>Concern has been expressed by several people and groups, including general practitioners, that some parents have been deterred from attending their family doctor, or from bringing their children to the doctor, by the cost involved. People should not be discouraged from visiting their family doctor, and especially from bringing their children to the doctor, because of cost. For this reason, the Government has decided to introduce a new medical card which will enable 200,000 people on low incomes to visit their GP free of charge. This measure will remove for individuals and families any concern about the cost of bringing their child <Col N="1355"/>to a doctor or attending themselves. People will be able to get the advice and reassurance that they need from their GP and, if necessary, be referred to other health services in either the community or the acute sector as necessary.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>It is important to remember that not all concerns or medical conditions with which people attend their doctor necessitate the prescription of medication, so in many cases no cost need arise in that regard. For those who require prescription medication, under the drugs payment scheme no one need pay in excess of &euro;85 in prescription drug costs in a calendar month.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive is preparing for the introduction of the doctor-visit medical cards and is drawing up appropriate operational guidelines to enable applications to be assessed on a standardised basis across the country. Once that legislation has been enacted, the HSE will be able to begin promoting the scheme and inviting formal applications with a view to the first doctor-visit medical cards being issued during April.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Irish Medical Organisation has welcomed the initiative and I look forward to its co-operation in the introduction of these new medical cards in the interests of the families and individuals concerned. I understand that the Health Service Executive has written to the IMO, inviting it to discuss the administrative and operational arrangements regarding the implementation of the doctor-visit card. The additional funding of &euro;60 million provided in the current year should allow up to 200,000 doctor-visit medical cards to be issued. The Health Service Executive intends initially to set the income threshold for the doctor-visit cards at 25% higher than applies for the standard medical card. That threshold may be reviewed in light of experience to ensure that the desired numbers of cards are being issued to those intended to benefit under the initiative.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new doctor-visit cards should also be seen in the context of the broader modernisation agenda under way for the medical card schemes. A medical card review project was set up under the former Health Boards Executive in April 2002 to assist the health boards in the promotion of good administrative practice regarding the management of the medical card scheme and the achievement of high standards for their customers. Nine sub-projects were established undertaking the following: the management and control of the GMS register; administrative processes and standards; modernisation and development of the appeals system; modernisation and simplification of application and review forms; the development of customer satisfaction measurements; examination of IT system integration options with health boards and the GMS payments board; researching and clarifying guidelines in interpretation of legislation; developing a training strategy; and developing training in the principles of good decision-making.</P><Col N="1356"/>
      <P>The work of those sub-projects was accepted by the board of the Health Boards Executive. It is now being progressed, under the auspices of the Health Service Executive, by a national steering group set up to oversee implementation of the outputs of the Health Boards Executive process. The work of the project will modernise the operation of the medical card and related schemes to make them more customer-friendly, administratively streamlined, fair, accountable and IT-enabled.</P>
      <P>I now propose to outline the scope and principal provisions of the Bill. For the purposes of clarity I will deal first with long-stay charges and then with doctor-visit medical cards. The Bill is designed to eliminate the anomalies that have arisen under the current legislation for raising charges for long-term care in publicly funded long-term care institutions. In addition, the Bill and regulations will promote consistency in the application of charges, with greater clarity for those receiving services and the public generally, as well as promoting administrative efficiency and transparency throughout the system.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for an amendment to section 53 of the Health Act 1970 which deals with the legal basis for the imposition of charges as follows. It replaces the existing enabling provision in subsection (2), which provides the Minister with discretionary power to make regulations by a provision, something that requires the Minister to make regulations to impose charges regarding all persons, that is, those with full and limited eligibility. As matters stand, section 53 of the Health Act 1970 provides power to make regulations to impose charges on those who have limited eligibility only. It inserts a new subsection (3) which specifies categories of person exempted from charges imposed under subsection (2). Such categories include all persons under 18, those detained involuntarily under the Mental Health Acts, those in receipt of medically acute care in hospitals and those pursuant to section 2 of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.</P>
      <P>We intend to insert a new subsection (4), which empowers the Health Service Executive to reduce or waive a charge on financial hardship grounds, and a new subsection (5) to make it clear that any current regulations in force under section 53 remain in force. The regulations in question are those which impose a hospital levy of &euro;55 a day, subject to a maximum payment in any 12 months of &euro;550. Those charges will continue not to apply to people with full eligibility &mdash; medical card-holders, including all over-70s &mdash; and a series of other exemptions, such as women in respect of motherhood.</P>
      <P>We are also inserting a new subsection (6) to provide that the charges shall apply for inpatient services only after a period of 30 days or periods <Col N="1357"/>aggregating 30 days within the previous 12 months. The new subsection (6) also limits the weekly charge to an amount that does not exceed 80% of the maximum of the weekly rate of old age non-contributory pension. We will insert a new subsection (7) to clarify that the period of 30 days referred to in subsection (6) begins to run immediately the person concerned is provided with inpatient services. We also intend to insert a new subsection (8) to provide that the charge shall be in respect of the maintenance aspect of inpatient services.</P>
      <P>I would now like to outline for the House the Bill&rsquo;s provisions regarding doctor-visit medical cards. Section 1 amends section 45 of the Health Act 1970 in two respects. In both cases the amendment is to ensure an alignment of the legal principles governing the award of the standard medical card and those contained in the provision to be included in section 58 of the Act in respect of the doctor-visit card.</P>
      <P>The amendment to be inserted by section 1(<i>a</i>) makes it explicit that the judgment as to whether a person meets the criterion of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; specified in section 45(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 1970 is made by the Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P>The amendment to be made by section 1(<i>b</i>) replaces the existing section 45(2) of the Health Act 1970 with a wording which makes it clear that decisions on eligibility by the Health Service Executive must be made not just by reference to a person&rsquo;s means but also to what constitutes reasonable expenditure on the person&rsquo;s behalf. This is in line with existing practice in the Health Service Executive whereby costs associated with such matters as a person&rsquo;s employment, reasonable housing provision and the care needs of children or dependants, as well as nutrition and clothing needs, are taken into account in determining whether a person faces undue hardship in meeting the costs of GP services.</P>
      <P>By amending the law in this regard we are making it a legal requirement that a person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure needs are taken into account in the application of section 45(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 1970. In both cases these provisions reflect what is already the practice of the HSE regarding the assessment of individuals for medical cards. These amendments, therefore, will not affect the processes and practices already in place as regards the award of the standard medical card.</P>
      <P>Section 2 amends section 47 of the Health Act 1970 by adding a reference to section 58 with the existing reference to sections 45 and 46. This is to ensure that the relevant appeals provisions extend to the scheme for doctor-visit medical cards.</P>
      <P>Section 3 amends section 47A of the Health Act 1970 to include the doctor-visit medical card scheme in respect of the Minister&rsquo;s power to issue guidelines to assist in decisions regardless of whether a person is ordinarily resident in the State. Guidelines issued to the health boards in this regard in 1992 and remain in force.</P><Col N="1358"/>
      <P>Section 5 replaces the existing section 58 of the Health Act 1970, which deals with the making available of general practitioner services without charge, with a new provision. The new subsection (1) will require the Health Service Executive to make available general practitioner services without charge not only to persons with full eligibility but also to persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the executive, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange these services for themselves and their dependants. This provides the legal basis for the granting of medical cards, the scope of which is confined to patients&rsquo; attendance at a general practitioner.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the new section 58 specifies the same general requirement regarding the making of decisions by the Health Service Executive in respect of doctor-visit medical cards as is being inserted regarding decisions on eligibility, that is, they must be made not just by reference to a person&rsquo;s means but also to what constitutes reasonable expenditure on the person&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) maintains the existing requirement that there be a choice of doctor for persons obtaining general practitioner services under section 58 and ensures that this applies to holders of doctor-visit medical cards as well as holders of the standard medical card.</P>
      <P>As the House will see, in respect of charges for long-stay care this legislation will bring clarity to an area which, it is now clear, has not been operating on a sound basis for nearly 30 years. This is a genuine move to provide that charges for long-term care that are imposed have a sound legal basis. The legislation will also ensure that the income flow from charges imposed to date is secured and that it will continue to support the provision of quality services to those in long-term care. It has been accepted that these charges, as contributions to the cost of care, are fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>With regard to new medical cards, Government policy is, as stated in the programme for Government, to extend eligibility for medical cards for people most in need rather than to achieve coverage of a certain percentage of the population or to issue a specific number of medical cards.</P>
      <P>The introduction of doctor-visit medical cards will enable up to 200,000 additional people from lower income households to go to their doctor free of charge. This will help to overcome barriers to accessing GP services for many individuals and families who are above the standard medical card income guidelines. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to speak on the Bill. We would have preferred to see the T&aacute;naiste here but it is good to see a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister in the House talking about the health services because the Minister&rsquo;s colleague who held his position before the reshuffle has been as silent as a Trappist monk on this issue. He has still not made a statement &mdash; he was a great man for issuing statements &mdash; on his role <Col N="1359"/>in this issue. That is disappointing considering that Fianna F&aacute;il is the largest party in this House and should show more concern not only for the health services in general but also two issues we are talking about, namely, legalising nursing home charges and doctor only medical cards. However, a huge number of problems remain outstanding about which the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, or any member of Government do not appear to show much concern. Those problems are just as important to people as the two issues we are debating today.</P>
      <P>Of concern to me and some of the people I have been talking to is the reduction in the number of public only nursing home type beds in the health care system. Some people are of the view that what the Minister is trying to do in this legislation is force people into using private nursing homes, not because of eligibility criteria but because there are no public nursing home beds in certain areas, and the numbers available are constantly decreasing.</P>
      <P>That was brought home to me in my constituency where a new hospital to replace what was basically a workhouse, St. John&rsquo;s Hospital, Enniscorthy, is proceeding at an extremely slow pace. Phase one, currently being built, will not replace the current full complement of the hospital. St. John&rsquo;s is one of the few hospitals remaining in the country which is basically a former workhouse, a throw-back from two centuries ago. It is used now to look after the elderly in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I spent most of the day in County Kerry where two issues were brought to my attention. A promise was made to the people of Kenmare that &euro;2 million would be provided to put an extension on to the district hospital in the town. That money has not been provided and there is no commitment to make it available. The people have not got a straight answer from anybody regarding that money.</P>
      <P>I visited Dingle also where a local landowner made a very generous gesture in giving approximately five acres of land to the health board on which it could build a new district hospital for the people of that peninsula. Again, no commitment was forthcoming and there has been no indication of when the funding will be made available to build a hospital.</P>
      <P>The district hospital in Dingle is also a former workhouse. One can go up to the third floor of that hospital &mdash; thank God it is no longer used for patients &mdash; and see the original lay-out of the workhouse as it was in 1840. One can see where the straw would be brushed out of the wards when the bedding was changed once every six weeks when it was used as a working house. Now, over 150 years later, we are talking about imposing nursing home charges on people who are being treated almost like the way animals were treated. It is disgraceful that we are talking about imposing nursing home charges when we should examine how we can look after the elderly in our society.</P><Col N="1360"/>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to implement a policy which will force patients into private nursing homes, not because the care in private nursing homes is substandard, although that issue has been raised a few times in this House regarding certain institutions, but in terms of the cost to patients. That is something of which the Minister has not taken much notice. These nursing home charges have now been made legal but the Minister should examine the overall level of cost to patients.</P>
      <P>That is an issue we have raised in the House since the legislation was passed before Christmas. It was raised at Question Time and again two weeks ago. Subvention payments, which patients are entitled to if they have to go into private nursing homes, average &euro;150 per week. There has been no increase in that payment since 2001. For all the fine words we have heard in the House, a basic entitlement for elderly patients has not improved since 2001. Where does that leave patients if they need to obtain additional funding to enable them to enter nursing homes?</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, one will not come across too many private nursing home beds that cost &euro;150 per week. The people to whom I refer must seek enhanced subvention payments. Such payments are described by some as being at the discretion of the CEOs of the respective health boards. Patients are beginning to feel, however, that they are at the mercy of health board officials rather than their payments being at the discretion of those individuals. This is as a result of the difficulties they encounter in obtaining enhanced payments that are realistic in nature. I will provide an example of this later. The vast majority of patients in private nursing homes are paying in excess of &euro;500 per week to retain their places there. That is a huge burden on the individuals involved and on their families.</P>
      <P>We discussed this issue on Question Time two weeks ago. I referred to a patient in County Wexford with whom I am familiar who sold her house a number of years ago and used the proceeds to fund her stay in a nursing home. Her money was beginning to run out when she raised the issue with me last November. I tried to make contact with the local health board and with officials throughout the region on her behalf. The best response we received was the woman in question would receive an enhanced payment of &euro;80 per week. This was despite the fact that she paid approximately &euro;600 per week for her nursing home place. When I raised the matter on Question Time, the health board miraculously arrived at a solution last week and the woman will be given a bed in a public nursing home.</P>
      <P>What happened in the case to which I refer is disgraceful for a number of reasons. I would hate to think that the woman in question&rsquo;s continued long-term nursing home care had anything to do with political intervention. One of the major problems with our health service is that too many of the services it offers are at the discretion of people who should not possess that type of power <Col N="1361"/>in the first instance. The position as regards people&rsquo;s entitlements should be much clearer. I refer here not only to medical cards but to long-term care in institutions. Some of the provisions in the legislation will exacerbate the problems that exist or will, at least, return us to the bad old days when politicians had more to say about people&rsquo;s health care than did their doctors.</P>
      <P>Concerns about the care of patients with dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease have been raised on numerous occasions. The Government is implementing a policy relating to the care of those with dementia. This was supposed to be put in place within seven years, commencing in 2002. I have not seen any major progress being made in respect of that policy, despite the fact that concerns about the two issues to which I refer are becoming more widespread. There is a major cost involved for families that try to pay for services on a private basis. Dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients are categorised as high dependency and require additional nursing care. This means, therefore, that there is an extra cost involved.</P>
      <P>The Government is making extremely slow progress in respect of this matter. Most of the patients have seen nothing in terms of points four, five and six of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s magic ten-point plan to resolve the accident and emergency crisis. A great deal was made about the provision of 100 long-term residential beds, step-down facilities and respite facilities. Most of the patients to whom we are referring will see little benefit from the provisions in the plan. The Government needs to wake up to reality and deliver a much better service to elderly patients. All it is doing in this legislation is legalising a cock-up it made three to four years ago. The Government knew much more about this matter than has emerged to date and I am anxious to see what the Travers report will have to say in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred earlier to the health strategy, which was the bible for Fianna F&aacute;il during the most recent general election. National goal No. 2 of the strategy states &ldquo;New legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement will be introduced.&rdquo; The target date for this was 2002. No action has been taken on this goal in the past three years. It is easy to see why that is the case. When someone decided to examine the legislation, did they recognise that there was a problem <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> nursing home charges and a huge number of other issues on which the Government has not delivered?</P>
      <P>While what is happening in terms of the provision of health services might be seen as the continuation of a form of political patronage into the 21st century, in some respects it might also be seen as evidence of the Government&rsquo;s incompetence. Perhaps the Government behaves as it does because it is afraid to make any difficult decisions for fear that this will cost it votes. Services are being denied to patients and there is, therefore, clear guidelines and legislation. I refer here to the <Col N="1362"/>legislation promised since 2002, which must to be delivered. The Minister of State referred to a nine-point plan and the fact that a number of sub-groups are considering this matter at present. How long will those sub-groups continue to meet before we see real action in terms of people&rsquo;s entitlements?</P>
      <P>It is sad that the T&aacute;naiste is not present because I would like to ask her where she stands in terms of a policy to fund the care of the elderly in the future. There is major uncertainty and insecurity in respect of this matter at present. We have broached this subject on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il in recent months but, again, no clear answers have been offered in respect of it. The Minister of State made an important point on a recent Question Time when he stated that if a person&rsquo;s house is worth in excess of &euro;75,000, this would be taken into consideration as means when he or she is seeking subvention payments in respect of private nursing home care. He stated earlier that he does not understand why a person who owns a house worth more than &euro;1 million should receive support from the State. Where does the Minister of State stand as regards the grey area in terms of houses worth between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million? At what point does the Government believe someone&rsquo;s private house should be considered as part of his or her means?</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste got into a hell of an amount of hot water when, at a conference in 2003, she stated that a person&rsquo;s private home should be considered as means when he or she is seeking a nursing home subvention. The Government has completely fudged this issue since 2002. Another of its objectives in the health strategy was that, by the end of 2002, it would publish a policy on funding of the care of the elderly into the future. I understand that a number of submissions on that matter were made to the Department of Health and Children and that a policy was drawn up but that, for some reason, the Government has not seen fit to publish it. Even though the position is being regularised and we are making it legal to take money from elderly patients in nursing homes, the Government has done nothing to inform those who are 55 years or older who may wish to avail of these services in the future exactly what will be their entitlements.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of Government to make decisions and I am surprised this Administration is sitting on the issue and making no progress on it. I am of the opinion that a large number of members of the Cabinet &mdash; both Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Ministers &mdash; want to take family homes from elderly people to pay for their long-term care but that for some reason they are hedging their bets and refusing to make a decision on the matter. That failure to make a decision is probably holding back a number of other initiatives and this should be made clear to the people. Funding for care of the elderly into the future will become a massive issue within the next decade. It is time for action and not hedging <Col N="1363"/>one&rsquo;s bets. The Government must come clean on this matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>I wish now to deal with the issue of doctor-only medical cards. I am disappointed with the Government&rsquo;s handling of this issue. I promoted the granting of such cards before the T&aacute;naiste announced their creation in the Estimates. I stated that we should immediately introduce a system involving such medical cards because I have seen the difficulties that arise in general practice. A number of patients do not receive the services to which they are entitled because of the cost involved in delivering them. Some mothers will not bring their children to see a doctor because of that cost. The solution to it was that people could get a professional opinion that would help to relieve the anxiety as to whether they were genuinely sick or it was just a viral illness that did not require further treatment. We are now approaching the month of March and not one doctor-only medical card has been issued. Not only that, 10,000 standard medical cards have been withdrawn since the announcement was made in the Estimates that 30,000 more were promised. That is not a proper reflection on the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to the health services and especially to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State pointed out in his speech that the Department was going to deliver medical cards to patients on grounds of need rather than on the basis of percentage of the population. That is the Fine Gael position, as the Minister of State knows. We feel it they should be extended to 40% of the population. It is going to be done on the basis of what people should receive. However, nothing has been delivered and instead medical cards have been taken away since the announcement was made. It should never have been introduced as the permanent solution to this problem, merely as a temporary solution.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now introduced a third tier to the health care services. This will work out badly in the long term for the patients involved. My concern is how the medical card scheme is administered in tandem with the provision of health care to people who are dependent on the State. For instance, full eligibility is based on financial hardship but allows a certain discretion on medical grounds by a health board chief executive officer. A percentage of medical cards are supposed to be issued on a discretionary basis by the CEO based on the medical needs of patients rather than financial criteria. I welcome those initiatives and support them, but they still have the potential for abuse. However, there has not been much abuse of this kind within general practice, although doctors know that some people with medical cards are not entitled to them. It may be that such people did not fill in the forms honestly, but one cannot be 100% certain whether such cards are issued on the basis of who they know rather than what they need.</P>
      <P>However, the doctor-only medical card uses the term &ldquo;unduly burdensome&rdquo;, which is a lesser <Col N="1364"/>test than financial hardship. Going back to the health strategy, the Minister promised to reduce the ambiguity over entitlement to services. This term, &ldquo;unduly burdensome&rdquo;, may be interpreted in a number of different ways by health board officials in different regions. That means the problems we had with the old health boards, where services were different throughout the country, will continue. Some people in a given area were able to get enhanced subventions of up to &euro;500 a week while in other places they could only get up to &euro;300. It is a distortion of what people throughout the country may get. There is no level playing field when terms such as that are introduced. More problems are being introduced with this legislation than are being dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is vital that entitlement to any public service is clear-cut. That is where the legislation from 2002 is coming from. We must get rid of any semblance of grace and favour from the public service system, whether it is health care or public authority housing. Grace and favour means that people are more dependent on the politician or public officials than on the laws of the land and what they are legally entitled to. This legislation makes no great improvement on that. I detect a discretionary element creeping in which is more or less going back to putting people at the mercy of officials.</P>
      <P>It might be worthwhile to offer a short history lesson on this issue. The T&aacute;naiste likes to go back to 1970 when she talks about the issue of nursing home charges. Prior to 1970, the dispensary system was in operation where a doctor was hired in a local parish and patients considered too poor to pay were allowed to go to the dispensary medical practitioner. Patients got access to the dispensary doctor by getting either a green or a red ticket from the local politician. The green ticket entitled them to go to the doctor in the surgery whereas the red ticket entitled them to house calls. The reason the system was got rid of was that it was wide open to abuse and political cronyism, where people who were connected got the red ticket for house calls but those who were not only got the green and were told to go the surgery. So much of what is now being done goes back to that old system of basic abuse. I wish the Minister, in going to the trouble of doing all this, had cleared up that system to a greater degree.</P>
      <P>Some of the points scoring against the Opposition indicated in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech suggests that children with illnesses will not have to renew their medical cards. I have recently encountered a constituent with an adult family member who has intellectual disabilities and is entitled to a medical card. That medical card used to last for about two years at a time and the family is now getting renewal forms every six months for it, even though the person concerned is an adult with intellectual disabilities and there will be no change in personal circumstances in the next six or 12 months or even two years. Doctors see this system creeping into general practice as well where cards are being given for shorter <Col N="1365"/>periods. Perhaps the health boards hope that in some cases patients will not renew their cards, will not have the ability to do so or will be too intimidated.</P>
      <P>Such issues regarding primary and elderly care are constantly being raised in this House. The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech appears to indicate that much is being done in this regard but in fact it is very little.</P>
      <P>This legislation seems to have been thoroughly vetted from a legal viewpoint so that a referral to the Supreme Court will not be warranted and we will not be debating it again in the House in two months&rsquo; time. Perhaps the reason the Minister of State is present is because the T&aacute;naiste does not want to have to face into this again. Section 1(<i>b</i>) of the Bill, which amends section 45 of the Health Act 1970, states in respect of a spouse: &ldquo;including the means of the spouse, if any, of that person, in addition to the person&rsquo;s own means&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister of State should ask a constitutional lawyer to have a look at that because it might be considered to be an unconstitutional attack on marriage. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify this in case he has to return to the House in two months and start all over again with a third version of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am astonished that he and not the T&aacute;naiste is taking the Bill. I do not see this as a matter of sorrow, as Deputy Twomey does. Rather, it engenders in me a certain suspicion. The Minister developed a reputation over the years for shouldering responsibility and telling it as it is, yet it is noteworthy that she is absent. At a time when a Bill is being introduced in the House relating to two issues central to Government policy, it is remarkable that the Cabinet Minister responsible is absent.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with two unrelated matters. It provides for charges to be levied for nursing home care in line with the Supreme Court judgment on the Bill recently struck down. It also provides for the new general practitioner-only medical cards. While they are unrelated, the two issues are linked. In 2001, when the Government drew up legislation to extend medical cards to the over-70s, the anomaly regarding charges being levied against those in public nursing homes came into sharp focus. This was the moment when the fudge that had prevailed should have been faced up to. That point was made by the Supreme Court and begs the question why the Government parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, did not deal properly with issue then. It was the Government&rsquo;s decision to change the law on medical cards, which has proven to be extremely wasteful and costly for taxpayers. It was a decision made for opportunistic electoral purposes.</P>
      <P>Now that she is presiding over this fiasco, the Minister is desperately trying to wrap the mantle of 11 Governments around her for protection. She referred back to the McInerney case in 1976 <Col N="1366"/>in her attempt to spread the blame. She also referred to senior counsel opinion provided by Ronan Keane in 1978, but there is no published record as to what that opinion states. She has an obligation to publish that opinion so that we can see what precisely is the basis of the argument used in her damage limitation exercise. If there are matters arising from that opinion which are in the public interest, I strongly urge her to publish it now.</P>
      <P>She also needs to tell the House when and why exactly she changed her view on the nature of the problem. In her speech of 16 February 2005, she stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">In my statement to the House last December I stated that the charges had been levied in good faith. The Taoiseach made similar statements, both of us on advice and on the basis of the information available to us at that time. The Supreme Court decision today does not make a judgement whether the charges were made in good faith or bad faith, but in the light of the Supreme Court judgement and in the light of information that came to light in preparing for the hearings at the court, I would not now characterise the levying of these charges in the way I did in December. For example, legal advice was provided in 1978 by then Senior Counsel Keane and McCann that the basis of charges was not sound.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This statement has very serious implications. If a public official or office holder purports to exercise those powers, having received legal advice that such an exercise would be contrary to the law, he or she leaves himself or herself personally open to accusation of malfeasance in public office. One can only presume that the Minister for Health and Children had chosen her words carefully, so her words open up the scenario that cast doubt on the competence, integrity and liability in the civil courts of public officials and public office holders.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister clarify the time she changed her view and the information that led her to arrive at such a potentially damning conclusion. We do not need to wait for publication of the Travers report since she made these statements in the House and should be able to reveal the basis for them in this House. I hope that she does this by the end of Second Stage. Despite her commitment to publish the Travers report swiftly and her indications that the report would be on her desk yesterday, we now know there is a delay in bringing it to Cabinet. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply this morning did not engender confidence that this report would quickly be in the public arena. Will we have to wait until after the by-elections before the public can have the full information to which it is entitled? It certainly seems that the process is being delayed unduly, which is not acceptable to anyone from the Opposition and does nothing to enhance the Minister&rsquo;s already bruised reputation.</P><Col N="1367"/>
      <P>We know that the issue of charges and their legality were clarified with the introduction of the over-70s medical card scheme. In 2002, the South Eastern Health Board sent an 80 page legal opinion to the Department relating to long stay care and the legality or otherwise of the charges. We know it was also circulated to other health boards, but we do not know what was in that legal opinion. I have sought that the legal opinion received by the SEHB be published, but again the Minister has refused to do so. It appears that she prefers to drip feed selected items of information as it suits her, to put some gloss on her own deplorable record of trying to legalise retrospectively unlawful charges against vulnerable people. Again I ask her to publish this legal opinion and, with the Keane opinion, to open it to public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>She has published the minutes of a very high level management advisory committee and CEO meeting which was attended by three Ministers, Deputies Martin, Tim O&rsquo;Malley and Callely, as well as senior departmental figures and health board CEOs. It is interesting that the Minister who was not at that meeting is here today for this debate. The issue of long stay charges was the third item on the agenda and a clear decision was made to refer this matter to the Attorney General to have an assessment of the need for a stand-alone Bill. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated that he was not present for that particular part of the meeting, yet it is simply incredible that he did not read the minutes of that meeting nor understand the importance of the matters involved.</P>
      <P>It beggars belief that the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, can maintain such a position. He has serious questions to answer and he should come into the House to answer questions on his entire role in this fiasco. He cannot wash his hands in the manner of Pontius Pilate, no matter how hard he tries to do so. The Minister of State with responsibility for older people was in attendance all the way through the meeting, as was the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health. What have they to say for themselves? How do they explain their negligence on an issue that was the subject of a central discussion at a meeting at the highest level of their Department? Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell defended the Minister in this House, claiming that Ministers were being kept in the dark and that this was the problem. That may be part of the problem, but it is very clear from this meeting that Ministers were not kept in the dark and that the issue was discussed in their presence.</P>
      <P>During her speech on the original Health (Amendment) Bill 2004, which has since been struck down, the current Minister for Health and Children stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Arising from that meeting a small group was convened within the Department to prepare a position paper on the legal issues surrounding charges for long stays in public institutions. <Col N="1368"/>This position paper was drawn up at the end of January 2004, as was a letter to the Office of the Attorney General requesting legal advice that would have been signed by the Secretary General. Unfortunately, this letter was not sent at that time.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Was any Minister involved in any way with this special group? Was there involvement in any way by the senior Minister in respect of the letter to the Attorney General not being sent? We are having a debate on these issues and asking legitimate questions, yet we do not have the essential information that this House needs to ensure proper scrutiny of the Government record. The Travers report is delayed and that fact can be used as a handy shield for the current Minister for Health and Children, but there is nothing to stop her from fully answering the questions posed today that need to be answered. It might redeem her in the eyes of some, at a time when she needs it.</P>
      <P>In the most recent opinion poll, one third of the population now thinks that the health service has deteriorated under her watch. This is a remarkable come-down for a Minister who promised so much on taking office. She stated: &ldquo;The one thing I want for the country I love is to have a health service that is accessible to every citizen regardless of their wealth.&rdquo; She went on to speak about a world-class health service. We now find that six months later, one third of the population is convinced that during her term of office, the health service has deteriorated.</P>

      <P>All we have seen from the Minister has been the administrative change in the establishment of the Health Service Executive. In a tremendous rush before Christmas and following a disgracefully guillotined debate it was established on 1 January. Now that it is in existence, I can compare it only to a headless chicken running to stand still. It is without direction, leadership or a chief executive officer. As we saw in recent days, the body the Minister vaunted as the great hope to manage the health service cannot even organise and manage a phone helpline. Hundreds of people could not get past a voicemail message to obtain the information they needed on the hospital charges debacle. I recall my constituency colleague, Deputy Roche, making great mileage out of the ending of the voicemail culture in the public service. I wonder what his criticism would be of his Cabinet colleague&rsquo;s failure to ensure the successful operation of a helpline.</P>
      <P>It is important that we receive answers on the Travers report. The Minister for Health and Children, Harney commissioned the report was commissioned and undertook that it would be completed quickly and published. This morning, my party Leader asked the Taoiseach to indicate when the report would be published, but the latter refused to answer the question. He evaded it and failed to indicate a timeframe, saying it was already in the public arena, which it is not. It should be. It is important to ensure that publi<Col N="1369"/>cation of the report does not depend on what is in it, but on the public&rsquo;s right to know. While the Minister herself has described the fiasco as the result of systemic maladministration, she has not explained in detail precisely what she means. She is noted for shooting her mouth off on occasion as we saw in the impact such behaviour had in the context of a tribunal issue. When a Minister uses such language, she has a duty to explain precisely what she means and should not leave her words to hang in the air and cloud an issue in a malign way.</P>
      <P>Somebody must clarify what people qualified for public nursing home care but did not receive it, as indicated by the ombudsman. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, has the answer. The people in question entered private nursing homes and were forced to pay for the care they received. We must hear a Government view on whether they have rights, including the right to compensation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Twomey pointed out, there are significant issues to address, which have nothing to do with charges and everything to do with long-stay care. There is a shortage of public nursing home beds. Quite apart from future needs, we lack the capacity to deal with today&rsquo;s demands. The Government promised to fast-track the delivery of 850 community long-stay nursing home beds through public private partnerships. Years after the promise, not one bed exists on a drawing board let alone in a completed facility. It is an indication of the lack of planning and strategising that has characterised the Government&rsquo;s policy on care of the elderly and it is a matter of great concern.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, the population is ageing. While we are fortunate that our population has a younger profile than those of many other member states, I would have thought it provided us with the opportunity to get things right ahead of time rather than to lay the foundations for a future crisis. Nursing home residents and their spouses are being pauperised as subventions are not enough to cover the costs of nursing home care. Some cannot manage to pay for care without losing everything, while others cannot pay even after losing everything due to their low incomes as pensioners. The Government must deal with a set of strategic issues in this context.</P>
      <P>While everybody understands and accepts the principle that the State should meet a portion of the costs facing people in public nursing care, the parliament for older people has pointed out that the proportion of a person&rsquo;s pension left for pocket money may be too low. When one itemises the costs for newspapers, haircuts, presents for relations and cigarettes, it becomes apparent that the proposal to limit pocket money at a low level requires review. I hope we receive more information on the way in which the compensation scheme will operate. In the case of the drugs refund scheme under which moneys were illegally deducted from people&rsquo;s funds, it was enormously difficult to access the sums owed. The <Col N="1370"/>onus was placed on individuals to make their cases to the Department instead of on the Department as the body that made the mistake. If the system of compensation is difficult to understand and places the onus on people to prove their cases, it will be unfair. Enough unfairness has been levelled against vulnerable people like those in long-term care.</P>
      <P>We are finally seeing legislation on the general practitioner only, yellow-pack medical cards. It is important to place the proposal in the context of the difference between the Government&rsquo;s promise and reality. The Government promised 200,000 new medical cards, not 200,000 yellow-pack cards. The original promise implied access to a great many services including drugs provision as per the entitlements under the security of medical card cover. It is important to note that since the Minister announced in November or December that she would provide 30,000 new medical cards, between 10,000 and 11,000 people have lost their cover. It is indicative of the difference between the Ministers&rsquo; promises and reality as experienced by patients who find it difficult to pay their bills.</P>
      <P>Opposition Members often complain that they do not have the resources required to make their cases. I am delighted we are to be provided with researchers in the near future. I pay tribute to the small, dedicated Labour Party staff who do a great deal of work to ensure that we have a sound basis on which to make our arguments in the House. Labour Party staff did excellent work in tracking the Government&rsquo;s record on medical cards as opposed to the spin. We produced a document recently, entitled A Cruel Deception, which tracks the story of the loss of medical cards during the term of office of a Government which promised to increase the number issued.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at what the Government has said. The national health strategy stated there would be significant improvements in income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low incomes eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, particularly those with disability. The 2002 Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto stated the party would extend medical card eligibility to more than 200,000 extra people with a clear priority given to families with children.</P>
      <P>These are the promises, but since 1994 the percentage of the population covered by medical cards has plummeted. Some 36% of the population was covered in 1994, but by 2004 that figure was down to 25.7%. The GP&rsquo;s contract allows for up to 40% of the population. We are a very rich country and we can afford to provide medical cards for people on low incomes who cannot get to see their family doctor and pay the drug bills to keep their families well.</P>
      <P>This is a cheap &ldquo;Lidl style&rdquo; medical card. Money is being diverted elsewhere by the Government into less important causes. What can be more important than a family having the security of a medical card? They could have that without legislative change. They could have it <Col N="1371"/>immediately without new deals with doctors, or awful deals such as that struck with regard to the over-70s. It should be straightforward; it is all there.</P>
      <P>The only thing required is a Government to commit the money and live up to its promises. However, that is what we do not have. We have a Minister who claims she is now delivering 200,000 new &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; GP cards. Shame on her. People need the security of knowing they can access care when they need it. A family-only doctor card is better than nothing, but are we really that cheap in this country? Have we not developed in ways that we can afford to? Are we going backwards? One only needs look to the past. The former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Erskine Childers, delivered and ensured there was fairness in the system. He created a way of ensuring people could access care, yet now when we are so much richer and more capable of providing for people we are doing proportionally less for them. That is deeply disappointing and adds to the cynicism people feel about the Government.</P>
      <P>While the number of medical cards has plummeted, medical costs have also plummeted. Our document showed, for example, that there has been a 62% increase in health inflation since 1997. The industrial wage went up by only 51% and the increasing rate of inflation by 29.4%. Until the recent changes the increase in income threshold for medical cards was only 27.88%. One must look at the actual costs that people without medical cards must meet. Inflation in the health sector is up 62% since 1997; inflation in the cost of doctors&rsquo; fees is up 75.6%; and inflation in the cost of hospital fees is up 108%. The drugs threshold has increased greatly. People simply cannot afford to care for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>We now have a cut-rate deal which may or may not work. The Minister promised 30,000 medical cards, but fewer people are now getting cover than when she took office. She is stating that this Bill will bring in 200,000 people under the &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; scheme, but there is no link between the Bill and the figure of 200,000. She may say that, but the evidence is not there. We must tease out this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Last night I attended a meeting of post-polio sufferers and the issue of medical cards and long-term illness cover came up. This issue was raised at the Joint Committee on Health and Children and there was all-party unanimity that post-polio sufferers and their support group need to be prioritised. These people are suffering the severe effects of polio later in life even though they contracted it years ago. There is only one generation; there will be no more. However, these people are still in our community and still experience great difficulties. I urge the Minister to ensure this small category of vulnerable people are properly provided for.</P>
      <P>I thank the Secretary General for coming to the committee and I thank the Minister for providing <Col N="1372"/>&euro;300,000 for this group. However, the protection of the medical card scheme and long-term illness cover would substantially improve their lives. That type of intervention would prolong the quality of life for those who suffer so much, and we should look after them.</P>

      <P>This legislation is in many ways an attempt to mop up, but the health service requires much more than mopping up. It is important that we have this debate to try to tease out some of the areas which have not been addressed in this legislation. I want to stay with the legislation because while an overall debate on the health service is necessary, it will not be justified simply by this legislation. Time must be set aside for it.</P>
      <P>A number of my constituents are affected by the illegality of the Government&rsquo;s actions in terms of payments for nursing home care. Included in the number are young adults as well as the elderly. People with learning disabilities in particular are concerned that they are forgotten in the overall debate. I do not take from the enormous concern that exists among elderly patients and their relatives. However, we should perhaps give a more comprehensive breakdown because the headlines tend to focus on the issue of the elderly, and, while it is right that they do so, the whole picture must be seen and understood.</P>
      <P>There have been enormous problems in the area of elderly care, as has been mentioned by other speakers. Deputy Twomey spoke earlier of the overall condition of nursing homes. In the past, for example, people requiring residential care fell between two stools, not only in terms of entitlements, enhanced entitlements or the bureaucracy involved in making applications, but also geographically. Enormous distress was caused when an ambulance did not arrive from the nearest location but from the centre of a health board area that was much further away. There was a lack of co-ordination in that regard but it is to be hoped that we have left that behind us now. It was a needless cause of distress to people in my area of Balbriggan which was closer to Drogheda than Dublin for ambulance services.</P>
      <P>The overall issue of nursing home standards and the provision of public nursing home facilities in particular requires further debate. I would welcome such a debate if it could be arranged. The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, will be aware of the extent to which home help is being cut back because his brother, my friend and colleague, Councillor J.J. Power, has probably told him about it. That cutback has a knock-on effect and is part of the important debate that needs to take place concerning nursing home care. People who find it difficult to manage generally prefer to stay in their homes. The availability of a home help can make the difference between having a good quality of life or, sometimes, losing the will to live. Home helps represent exceptionally good <Col N="1373"/>value for money but they earn meagre pay. That problem needs to be addressed by providing proper remuneration for the work done. There is no comparison between the cost of providing home help and the cost of a nursing home place. The amount saved by not having to provide a nursing home place makes the provision of home help more than worthwhile. The Department should examine how it can satisfy the need for home helps thus avoiding the fall-back position of providing nursing home places, because that appears to be the only available option. The Minister of State is in a good position to address that matter, so I would like to hear his views on that question which is relevant to the general discussion on nursing homes.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Minister of State referred to general practitioner-only medical cards. A trend is developing whereby people find they are unable to attend their GPs as often as they used to. They find there is only one option, which is the GP who happens to be available. The solution may involve discussions with the GPs themselves. Yesterday was work balance day, so GPs need to take this matter into account as well. When somebody cannot visit their own GP who is familiar with their case history, it represents a lowering of health care standards. Their local GP represents a better chance of providing holistic health care because he or she knows the patient and may know their family members as well. That is a help when it comes to treating hereditary diseases.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage, I hope we can examine those issues, which are relevant. They may not fall directly within the terms of the legislation but, nonetheless, they represent an opportunity to raise expectations through upgrading the provision of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which provides for the introduction of GP-only medical cards as well as providing a basis for levying charges on elderly persons in nursing homes and full-time care. Nobody doubts that the provision of GP-only medical cards, or &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; cards as they are popularly known, is a step in the right direction. However, the Bill appears to have a few ominous, restrictive qualifications that will water down the provision of such cards.</P><Col N="1374"/>
      <P>I call for a moratorium for people who currently have medical cards. Some form of instruction should be issued not to withdraw medical cards from those who have them, although that appears to be the trend. It is most likely that the people whose medical cards might be withdrawn will automatically become entitled to the doctor-only cards. Until the Bill is enacted and the new cards become available, we should avoid pulling the plug by withdrawing medical cards from those who currently hold them.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions contain some restrictive qualifications, particularly the phrase &ldquo;[for whom] it would be unduly burdensome to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants&rdquo;. The matter is left to the discretion of the new Health Service Executive, with no income guidelines specified in the legislation. It seems there will be a decrease in the number of medical cards provided.</P>
      <P>One of the benchmarks for community welfare officers is an income guideline. It may not be the best method and on many occasions we have criticised such income guidelines but at least they provided a benchmark. I am concerned that the withdrawal of medical cards will now be left to the discretion of the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive. The provision of 200,000 GP-only medical cards to bring borderline cases in line with regular medical cards would seem to be little more than a pipe-dream divorced from reality. The number of medical cards is being reduced. We were promised 200,000 extra cards but they are not coming on stream; they are being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Apart from the lack of guidelines for the provision of medical cards, the insufficient number of GPs to cater for 200,000 GP-only cards will have to be addressed. There is a crisis, particularly in some rural areas that cannot attract newly qualified doctors. That issue must be addressed as well.</P>
      <P>Holders of GP-only medical cards will have to pay up to &euro;85 for prescription drugs and hospital services. The cost of visits to a GP is a serious deterrent for people on low incomes. The provision of GP-only cards recognises this and is a step in the right direction in that it will be more likely that such card holders will visit their doctors and, therefore, that their illnesses will be diagnosed earlier. The medical evidence is that early diagnosis and intervention can lead to a more successful result from treatment. Early intervention means that patients will not have to wait while their illnesses deteriorate or face increased medical costs as a result. If they remain untreated, such people can become emergency cases availing of hospital accident and emergency units. These issues must be examined.</P>

        <Quest>the revised proposals she intends to make to the European Commission following its rejection of the Government&rsquo;s implementation strategy on the nitrates directive; the interim measures she intends to take to commence the implementation of the directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland submitted an action programme for further implementation of the directive to the European Commission on 22 October 2004. The Commission conveyed its view, by way of a letter of formal notice under Article 228 of the European Union Treaty issued to Ireland dated 22 December 2004, that the action programme is not complete and does not comply with the requirements of the directive and the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland delivered on 11 March 2004.</P>
        <P>My Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of a response to the Commission. Senior officials from my Department and their counterparts in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are in contact with the relevant Commission officials and this process of consultation and negotiation is continuing.</P>
        <P>The action programme submitted to the Commission in October included arrangements for further implementation of the directive. These are among the elements that the Commission queried in its letter of formal notice on 22 December. The discussions with the Commission that are currently taking place at official level are exploring these aspects along with the others that the Commission raised.</P>
        <P>Agreement with the Commission is necessary, not only to avoid the risk of substantial fines on Ireland but also to safeguard ongoing EU funding of rural development measures. It remains my objective, and it is also the objective of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to reach agreement on an action programme that meets the objectives of the nitrates directive in terms of safeguarding water quality while also minimising the burden of compliance that the agreement will place on farmers <Col N="1376"/>and safeguarding the future of the commercial farming sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her response. From that and the Minister&rsquo;s comments on 9 February at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, it appears she is teeing us up for a fall-back in regard to the Brosnan proposals. Is that the case? In her response, the Minister focused on the discussion and negotiation. Is she prepared to defend the scientific basis that has been put forward in the Brosnan proposals and make the case on the scientific evidence rather than entering into negotiations with the Commission and climbing down from the Government&rsquo;s position in regard to the Brosnan proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Brosnan proposals which were agreed by all of the stakeholders have not been accepted by the Commission. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his officials, in addition to my officials, went to Brussels where we had discussions with the Commission on the basis of the Brosnan proposals. However the Commission is still adamant that it will not accept the proposals. In particular, it believes the mandatory waste storage periods are too short. The Commission also takes issue with the closed periods. It accepts the division of zones in theory but the ones proposed by Brosnan are not acceptable. The Commission wishes to see regulations having a binding effect on farmers and it did not consider that the material in the proposals was sufficiently detailed.</P>
        <P>Further exploration and discussions are needed with the Commission to ascertain what will be acceptable to it. That is why I said that discussions and negotiations are taking place. The situation is serious. There are major financial implications for us, in the region of &euro;11 million, once the court case date clicks in. As well as not getting agreement we will have difficulties in our rural development measure, about which I would have serious concerns. Moreover, the farming community is aware that there must be an opportunity to discuss and negotiate what will be acceptable to the Commission and to the farming fraternity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the closed periods, storage issues and so on were put forward on the basis of the scientific evidence available to Mr. Denis Brosnan? That case has already been put forward. It now appears that both the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are scaling back from that and are looking at extended closed and storage periods. The Minister does not appear to be prepared to support her own scientific evidence that formed the basis of the proposals put forward in the first instance. She now appears to be more preoccupied with rural development measures than the nitrates directive. Is the Minister pre<Col N="1377"/>pared to sacrifice the nitrates directive to get a good basis for the negotiation of the rural development budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is factually incorrect, as always. He has pre-empted one issue which he considers to be more important than another. The nitrates directive is not within my ambit; it is within the ambit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That said, I am acutely aware, as are my colleagues, of the implications of the nitrates action plan. Perhaps we should have taken some of these concerns on board ten years ago. Deputy Crawford can nod away, but his party was in Government during that time as well and it did not do very much either to try and bring together the farming fraternities on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being realistic on the basis that an agreement has been implemented in Northern Ireland, and due to the necessity of agreeing an action plan and the financial and other implications of it for the country. Moreover, the farming fraternity is acutely aware of the issues that have arisen. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government went to Europe on the basis of the Brosnan proposals. They are not being accepted by the Commission, nor have many other proposals put forward by other member states which also had to be changed in order to satisfy the water quality issues set down by the Commission. We are in the process of having serious discussions with the Commission to ascertain what may be acceptable. On that basis, perhaps some compromise may be needed in order to have an acceptable nitrates action plan.</P>

        <Quest>if she intends to review the control and monitoring of chicken imports in view of the recent warning from the Food and Agri<Col N="1378"/>culture Organisation that the virus causing bird flu may be impossible to eradicate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds. Migratory waterfowl, most notably wild duck, are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses, and these birds are also most resistant to infection. Domestic poultry, including chickens and turkeys, are particularly susceptible to epidemics of rapidly fatal influenza.</P>
        <P>Avian influenza viruses rarely affect humans and do not normally infect species other than birds. The virus has on occasion, however, been isolated in humans, and in Vietnam, the H5N1 virus was isolated from a number of patients who died. There is, however, no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from poultry to humans other than by direct contact with infected birds. The risk from poultry meat to humans is negligible as the virus is destroyed during meat maturation, by cooking and by stomach acids.</P>
        <P>The conclusion of a three-day conference in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which was jointly organised by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health is that while progress has been made in disease detection and in rapid response to the disease there is need for more vigorous control campaigns in the countries in south-east Asia affected by avian influenza. Extensive publicity campaigns are suggested as well as the principle of segregation of species on family production units. It is hoped that these measures and others will, with the injection of appropriate funding, aid in the reduction in the risk of the spread of the virus to non-avian species and humans in the region.</P>
        <P>With effect from 23 January 2004, the European Commission invoked safeguard decisions to control the importation from south-east Asian countries that were approved to trade with the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding of the FAO report is that this disease will be present for several years in the countries which experienced outbreaks in 2004 and will be impossible to eradicate. It is also the view of the World Health Organisation that it is not a question of whether there will be an outbreak but rather when there will be a pandemic. Human health is primarily at issue, as are the implications for the poultry industry should there be an outbreak here. In this context, does the Minister of State think we have adequate resources in place to deal with inspection and regulation, particularly at border inspection posts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The resources are not a difficulty, they are more than adequate. Moreover, all consignments being imported into the EU must first be presented at EU border inspection posts. At the BIPs they undergo a documentary and ident<Col N="1379"/>ity check and the physical checks are carried at frequencies laid down by EU law. Where required, samples for laboratory analysis for the purpose of safeguarding human and animal health is also carried out. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions, it is released for free circulation within the Union.</P>

	<P>Other than the border inspections posts, through which consignments of any product are brought in for trade purposes, there is also a concern in regard to people bringing in personal imports of meat and other products. According to a reply by the Minister to a parliamentary question, up to June 2004, 2,500 tonnes of food was seized and destroyed but no prosecutions were undertaken in respect of the seized personal imports of animal products. Does the Minister of State think there are adequate numbers of inspectors to monitor those imports and what action can be taken? I am recording what is stated by the WHO and the FAO to the effect that it is almost inevitable that there will be a pandemic, with a huge impact on human health and possibly for the poultry industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On a more general note, we are keen to ensure that consumers of poultry meat have the right to the maximum amount of information about the food they are offered for sale so that they can make informed choices. In this regard, a number of regulations have been initiated in the past year and sanctioned by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
        <P>I know the Deputy has raised the issue of labelling on a number of occasions. The Minister raised the issue of labelling at EU level during a Council meeting and was supported by her German colleague. I assure the Deputy that the Minister, at every opportunity, raises this issue and is concerned to have in place a proper labelling regime, particularly for poultry which is imported from third countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is not one of labelling but rather one of detection and the procedures which are in place for it. We must have learned a very hard lesson from the foot and mouth disease. At that time there was a knee-jerk reaction whereby all the systems moved to protect Ireland from an outbreak of foot and mouth disease after it had been detected and declared in the UK. We were particularly lucky to escape as we did. We had good systems in place but there was a knee-jerk reaction in response. However, we now have an opportunity to put in place a system in advance. What plans does the Department have for such a system?</P>

        <P FLI="0">The issue regarding the sale of 4,500 tonnes of stored potatoes does not come within my remit and is a matter for resolution between the growers involved and the company with whom they carry on business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Tugaim faoi deara &oacute;na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; a thug an tAire St&aacute;it d&uacute;inn go bhfuil laghd&uacute; ann. I appreciate that negotiations are ongoing and I hope they will have a satisfactory outcome. However, the wider issue for which the Minister of State is responsible is the overall welfare and development of the potato growing sector in Ireland. As he has clearly outlined, the fact that the total area under production has fallen from 56,835 hectares in 1970 to just 12,000 at present represents a huge decline in potato growing in a country which should be exporting its produce as we are in other sectors. It is alarming. Some 20% of growers have left the business in the past five years and more will leave this year.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State have plans to develop the sector and arrest this decline? For example, does he recognise that there are particular difficulties in the seed potato sector at present? An application has been made for grant assistance in the development of the potato seed sector. More generally, if a grower is required to spend &euro;3,000 to grow an acre of potatoes and needs to sell the crop at approximately &euro;200 per tonne but is lucky to get &euro;150 or &euro;130 per tonne, how can he or she be expected to continue to grow potatoes? Is there a message in this that the Government does not expect people to continue growing potatoes in Ireland and that the sooner they sell their land for development the better? That is the message which is being sent out. Potato growers are being asked to do the imposs<Col N="1381"/>ible, to grow potatoes for less than &euro;130 per tonne.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister of State addressed this problem? Will he meet the IFA and the growers with a view to resolving the problem so that growers can continue to survive? They cannot do so on speculation as to what they might sell. They need a firm commitment on what they can sell. Will the Minister of State help in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Only last Thursday I spoke at the IFA-Teagasc national conference on potatoes and I met individual farmers both before and after my address. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and I have had a number of meetings with different stakeholders in regard to the potato industry. We recognise that it is a very valuable and important part of our agrifood industry. We met individual groups and industry figures representing the processing point of view as well as that of the growers. We also met the IFA national potato committee on a number of occasions. In addition, the Minister has met numerous potato growers and farmers in Donegal.</P>
        <P>We are very conscious of the issues outlined by the Deputy. The figures I supplied in my initial reply demonstrate that there has been a huge drop in the growing pattern in Ireland. At the same time, the value of the crop is approximately &euro;85 million and is very important. Recently, the Minister approved projects to the value of &euro;6 million. Some time before that, projects to the value of &euro;3 million were approved in regard to the upgrading and provision of new facilities. I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s argument that the Government is suggesting people should get out of the industry. The message we are giving to the farmers is that the industry has a future. Individual farmers are investing hugely in providing modern facilities with the support of the Department, which demonstrates that we have absolute confidence in the industry.</P>
        <P>The fresh potato sector has been under pressure for some time. I visited Ballymoney Foods in north Antrim at the request of Se&aacute;n Farren of the SDLP where I met the SDLP and DUP representatives with the management and workers of that factory. The facility is owned by farmers north and south of the Border. We are anxious that they will be able to extend their processing facility. When I was in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency I visited some state-of-the-art facilities where huge investment is taking place and where produce is being processed to the highest standards. We have invested a great deal in the past number of years in providing new facilities.</P>
        <P>We must improve value added potato products. Consumer eating habits have changed. There has been a growth in demand for pasta and rice and the prepared and convenience food sector has grown enormously. The number of meetings the <Col N="1382"/>Minister, Deputy Coughlan, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and I have had with different stakeholders in the potato industry clearly shows that we are determined to arrest the decline, at a minimum. We are also anxious that further investment takes place.</P>
        <P>Members who come from a different part of the country where livestock and dairying are the predominant agricultural activities have often spoken out against milk quotas and EU regulation. However, Deputy Sargent might agree that the common market organisation for certain products has had benefits as well, in that it provides stability. Potatoes are one of the few agricultural commodities that do not come within the common market organisation. In 2003, there was a 16% growth in potato production at EU level. Such growth leads to over supply and poorer prices for individual growers. That is part of the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Production is decreasing. The amount of potatoes being sold in a number of retail outlets is increasing so there is a demand for the product. I accept what the Minister is saying but actions speak louder than words. Is there a grant for the seed development sector or can we expect one?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. We are giving particular attention to the seed certification sector. We have had meetings<i> ad nauseam</i> with the different stakeholders. Furthermore, we have agreed with Bord Bia a specific promotion this year for potato products.</P>

	<P>Consultations are currently ongoing with the European Commission in regard to the action programme for implementation of the nitrates directive in Ireland. The question of possible changes to the levels of grant aid currently payable under the farm waste management scheme will be decided in light of the requirements of the action programme when agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that an increase in grant funding is needed, especially in those areas where a longer period of storage will be imposed? Does she accept that the current <Col N="1383"/>situation, where those with under 20 livestock units are ineligible for grant aid, must be changed? Otherwise, that sector will disappear. Can the Minister give us an assurance that proposals are being drafted in that regard? If any structures are to be put in place this year and given that planning permission and so forth must be taken into account, it is long past time there was a degree of certainty on this issue. I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s problems in this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This year I provided &euro;30 million for the scheme. Naturally, applications are slow in the context of the changes that arise from the nitrates directive. Under Sustaining Progress, we increased grant aid from 20% to 40%, which is substantial. We carried out an audit under Teagasc of what is available in the country at present. Under any agreement that is reached there will be a financial imposition on some farmers. As it stands, this is the case in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency. We are evaluating that and examining the cost implications. I have &euro;30 million this year for the farm waste management scheme.</P>
        <P>There is an issue with the 20 livestock units, particularly for part-time farmers and small farm enterprises. The Commission has opposed the concept of anything less than 20 livestock units. I do not agree with that view but the Commission believes that fewer than 25 is not viable. I will evaluate and ascertain, in the context of the changes that have taken place, the implications for those with fewer than 20 livestock units and what can be done to support them following whatever decision is made on the nitrates directive. I cannot give a commitment now as to what will be available. People have anticipations and others have made recommendations but until I know the full implications of it, I will not be in a position to ascertain how the scheme will look.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Minister has only been in office for a short time and that she has much work to do to rectify the damage done by her predecessor, who was in office for ten of the last 12 years and did nothing on the nitrates directive. The Minister said she has &euro;30 million, although I believe the amount is &euro;38 million, allocated for farmyard pollution. In 1997, £60 million was spent on this while last year only &euro;17 million was spent. Taking account of inflation, is the Minister satisfied that the &euro;38 million is sufficient or is she relying on the fact that there is so much red tape, farmers will be unable to draw down the money? The sum of &euro;38 million will not do much in this day and age to rectify the serious problem that exists. Does the Minister understand the anxiety among farmers over whether they will be in production in 12, 18 or 24 months as a result of this nitrates directive?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1384"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am acutely aware of the repercussions of the nitrates directive. A considerable amount of investment has already been made by farmers. We do not build slurry pits every few years; they last for a considerable period of time. The considerable investment farmers have made over the years has been grant aided by this Government. The Deputy has 20:20 vision with hindsight. As I recall it, the rainbow Government abolished the farm waste management scheme and on our return to Government we re-introduced it.</P>
        <P>I believe we have adequate resources at present. In the event of changes in the nitrates directive we will have to ascertain their financial implications for both commercial and small farm enterprises.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that digestate from anaerobic digestion may be spread on land under certain conditions but that a statutory instrument here still prevents spreading of digestate; and if she will consider the case being put by farmers such as a person (details supplied) in County Waterford who wrote to her Department on this matter in early January 2005.</Quest>
        <QRef>[7053/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Council Regulation (EC) 1774/2002 sets out the provisions relating to the disposal of all animal by-products including the digestate produced through anaerobic digestion in approved biogas plants. Under this regulation digestate, which may include animal by-products from such plants, may not be spread on pastureland.</P>
        <P>In addition, however, Ireland has adopted national controls to counteract the spread of BSE. The need to prevent the spread of this dis<Col N="1385"/>ease has been of central importance to Ireland since its discovery here in 1989. Over the years as scientific knowledge has progressed, a sequence of measures was introduced in the EU to combat the spread of BSE. These measures are aimed principally at ensuring the safety of the consumers of beef and at preventing the exposure of cattle to the infective BSE agent through feed. Ireland has adopted control measures in advance of other member states and, in some cases, has adopted more stringent controls than elsewhere in the European Union. One of the controls in place and laid down in S I 551 of 2002 prohibits, in effect, the spreading on land of digestate from a biogas plant where the feed stock used in that plant had any animal by-product in it containing animal protein.</P>
        <P>The robust approach we have taken has been successful in having Ireland&rsquo;s BSE controls validated within the European Union and by countries outside of the Union, thereby protecting valuable export outlets for our agricultural production on which we are uniquely dependant. In addition, the fall in the numbers of BSE cases in recent years and the increasing age profile of the cases detected is concrete proof of the effectiveness of the control measures in place.</P>
        <P>However, in view of the declining rate of BSE cases here, I have asked my officials to review the need to maintain specific control measures in the disposal of certain animal by-products, including those that may be included in digestate from biogas plants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, particularly as she is prepared to consider the current situation rather than dwelling on an historic situation which may not be as relevant as it was. I appreciate her precautionary approach. Naturally, we do not want to be reckless or in any way put at risk the important status we hold.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>To follow on neatly from Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s question, if there is to be a prohibition on the inclusion or acceptance of certain material for anaerobic digestion, what other plans are in place? Is it satisfactory that we would continue to stockpile? Will the Minister announce the outcome of whatever review she is undertaking given that producers have invested in plant and machinery for anaerobic digestion?</P>
        <P>All things being equal, it is a beneficial win-win situation in that it creates energy and material which is nutritious in terms of land spread being of an even consistency &mdash; more so than the raw material &mdash; and disposes of what otherwise would be a waste product. Will the Minister state when she plans to have an outcome of the review so we can reduce waste and benefit from other technology?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This also arises in the context of the directive under discussion. One of the con<Col N="1386"/>cerns that has been brought to our attention by pig and poultry and producers, for example, is that they will not have adequate lands available to spread slurry. Therefore, on that basis, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, considered the issue of energy crops and biofuels. The issue of anaerobic digestate is annexed to this. In my constituency, the farm relief service proposes to introduce an anaerobic digester.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government drafted the national biodegradable strategy. However, to progress and transfer from landfill to anaerobic digestion would require the amendment of statutory instruments. On the basis of present consultations, the changes with regard to BSE and the issue of dealing with the nitrates directive are at the top of the agenda for consideration. Changes will be made as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>It is new technology for us but old for others. On the basis of an attitudinal change in this country, opportunities arise in regard to this new technology. It is being advanced with other technologies to deal with what is perceived as a waste product but, as Deputy Sargent rightly suggests, which can be used. I hope an attitudinal change will also take place in the planning process, although I note Deputy Upton is rightly throwing her eyes to heaven.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that the land spreading of digestate is much easier than spreading the raw material as it does not have an odour problem? Has the Minister visited any of the anaerobic digestion plants, as I have, including one not far from the home area of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne? Farmers are using this. While the Department may not be familiar with it, many farmers take it as an integral part of their overall operation. A number of farmers are feeding raw material into one anaerobic digester I know of. They benefit greatly from easier spreading as well as creating a waste product which contains energy.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not had the opportunity to visit such a plant. The Deputy is correct to state that odour is reduced because the digestate is dry. Much work has been completed on the technologies involved. However, one of the difficulties is the not in my back yard syndrome. People do not want this type of facility in their vicinity. However, among the farming fraternity, producers are coming together to deal with this issue. For example, the poultry sector in County Monaghan provided facilities to deal with the effluent issue there. The Deputy is correct that this is the way forward. How far we progress will depend on the result of education on its benefits.</P>

	<P>Beef imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced, first, in countries and, second, premises listed and approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks laid down in the harmonised rules prescribed at European level and must be accompanied by the prescribed veterinary health certification from the competent authorities in the country of export.</P>
        <P>The Community beef labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to beef sold at retail level within the Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as &ldquo;Origin: non-EC&rdquo;, with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place.</P>
        <P>There is a gap in these EU requirements in so far as they do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level, and Ireland has raised this with the Commission. It is my intention to proceed with a national legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef served on such premises. Proposals to this effect will be brought forward once the legal options allowing for this development have been fully examined. In this regard, I am in consultation with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on the appropriate legal mechanisms to give effect to such labelling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Has the European Commission put forward a proposal to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to increase their imports into the European Union by approximately 300%? The Minister referred to audits by the EU&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office. Two separate audits were carried out in Brazil and both uncovered similar problems which have not been resolved. This threatens the issue of biosecurity of imports to this country and raises serious questions on traceability.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated the requirements do not apply to catering, which leaves the system open <Col N="1388"/>to abuse. It is also open to abuse in regard to the issue of substantial transformation. Will the Minister provide a timescale for addressing this issue? Ireland should be setting the agenda. Will she do this ahead of Commission proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of substantial transformation was raised by me on Monday last at Commission level, most particularly in regard to the poultry sector. The issue of labelling has now dawned for many EU member states which were vehemently opposed to this when it was led by the Irish. There is a change within the Council in regard to substantial transformation and sourcing, including date and place of slaughter. However, in the interim, Ireland is proceeding on the issue. While it would have been better and easier to do this in the context of a European decision, we are not prepared to wait.</P>
        <P>I met the T&aacute;naiste. She will facilitate primary legislation through her Department, at which stage we will be able to give legal impetus to a statutory instrument that I will put forward on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>What primary legislation is required and what is the timescale for it? I am glad the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion put the Government and the Commission in focus.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not get too big a head. I do not know if the Commission reads our reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It focused the Minister&rsquo;s mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My mind would have been more focused on this issue, particularly in the poultry sector, than the minds of some of the men in this House over the years. I am supporting our poultry sector. Some people may be surprised that consumers are not aware that in the majority of cases, the poultry they eat, particularly the majority of chicken breasts, do not come from this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not coming from the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is coming through the EU, assisted by the trains. Our fresh produce is good.</P>
        <P>I was prepared to introduce a statutory instrument when I came to this Department and I had been advised by the Attorney General that it must be supported by primary legislation. I found that it was going to take me some time to get back to the House with primary legislation and on that basis I am being facilitated with such legislation by means of a new health Act which the Minister for Health and Children will hopefully bring forward at the beginning of the next term if we get through everything else in this term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her answer and I welcome the progress being made. Another <Col N="1389"/>related issue is that of traceability. This is not just a matter of labelling. One can insist on any labels one wants to. First, there are issues surrounding the language in which labels are presented. Second, the issue of the Sudan Red 1 dye which has emerged in the past couple of weeks has made a significant impact for consumers regarding what they are eating and what other components might be in a product, not necessarily in beef or poultry but across the whole spectrum of foods we eat.</P>
        <P>I would like to know if there is any way of co-ordinating that information across the Departments. I appreciate that the Food Standards Authority has overall responsibility but the Minister&rsquo;s Department will not take questions regarding Sudan Red 1. It makes it very difficult for spokespersons on agriculture to get a response on behalf of the consumer who is eating these products. Traceability is therefore a major issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but it is not really my responsibility. The Food Standards Authority of Ireland, FSAI, comes under the Department of Health and Children because <?oasys _dc20-?>traceability is a food safety and public health issue. We must tackle the labelling issue in many ways. To be able to see what is on the label would be a start. People must also understand what is on the label, which is what Deputy Upton is speaking of. There are methodologies by which we can identify country of origin with date and place of slaughter, which is important. It is on that basis that we will look at that type of information.</P>
        <P>One of the major issues under the regulation is the transformation issue. I have indicated strongly that it is open to abuse, that it is not acceptable and that we are prepared to close it. I regret I cannot do much about the issue involving the FSAI but I reassure Deputy Upton that there is ongoing consultation between the FSAI and my Department on many issues, not necessarily on a weekly basis but very regularly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that attention has been given, as it needs to be, not just to labelling and traceability but also to the catering and restaurant business as that has been a glaring omission for a long time. Will the Minister say if the labelling reviews are looking at the need for a common label for Irish organic produce, which has suffered in marketing terms because of the diversity of labelling of food coming into the country and on Irish produce? I know that many organic producers have sought to have one label and I wonder what progress has been made on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to see an increase in organic capacity and to see the price issue addressed, as no doubt would Deputy Sargent. The issue of labelling will be considered in the context of changes made. A labelling group made a number of recommendations which have now been addressed but there are still opportunities and a need for reorientation. Perhaps even the <Col N="1390"/>organic producers should consider a particular symbol with which they would be synonymous as a group. That may be a matter for the trade itself, but I know that trademarking, and having an affinity with something one can see, is as important as labelling. If we are to compete in the organic area, which I would like to see happening, we must look seriously at the cost issue and the disappointing fact that so much of the organic food consumed in Ireland is not grown here.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Cuffe</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the situation with regard to Johne&rsquo;s disease here.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6979/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Johne&rsquo;s disease is widespread in other EU member states and indeed worldwide. It is a chronic infectious disease of cattle, which gives rise to gradual wasting and loss of condition. Most cattle are infected early in life and while adult animals can become infected, it is rare and they usually have other problems such as deficiencies with their immune system. The disease has been notifiable in this country since 1955.</P>
        <P>Until 1992, strict import conditions ensured that Johne&rsquo;s disease was relatively rare in Ireland. However, since 1993, the increase in the number of cattle imported in the aftermath of the single market contributed to a significant increase in the numbers of reported cases of the disease. In 2002 and 2003, 100 animals and 150 animals respectively were diagnosed as having Johne&rsquo;s disease.</P>
        <P>Figures of incidence of the disease for 2004 have not been collated. Results on samples submitted for culture can take up to six months because of the extremely slow growth pattern of the organism. Farmers in general appear to be more aware of the disease and the increased volume of samples particularly blood samples being submitted for analysis suggests that an increasing number are actively managing the disease on their own farms. Control of Johne&rsquo;s disease centres on hygiene and on-farm animal management in particular with respect to the rearing of potential breeding animals. I recognize the need for support of an effective national strategy to arrest and reverse the incidence of the disease.</P>
        <P>In an effort to raise awareness and to promote higher standards of hygiene management practices and calf rearing, my Department published two booklets in 2002 on Johne&rsquo;s disease. One of these is aimed at the farmer and the other at the private veterinary practitioner. These booklets detail the precautions individual farmers should take to keep the disease out of their herds. It would also be prudent for any prospective purchaser to seek private certification of freedom from Johne&rsquo;s disease from a vendor of cattle either imported from abroad or sourced within this country.</P>
        <P>In early 2003, my Department discontinued the policy of slaughtering affected animals when it <Col N="1391"/>became apparent that this approach was not effective. A strategic review, which involved consultation with relevant interests, of the approach to tackling the disease was initiated. The process generated a number of very useful proposals of a practical nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Does he recognise that the open market did not take account of the ability of diseases such as this to spread? I did not hear him mention quarantine in his reply, but will he consider the view I have heard expressed by farmers and vets that there is a need for closer attention to be paid to the quarantine issue, particularly for specimens of breeding animals coming into the country, and that this has slipped in the past? Will he agree that part of the problem is that there was not sufficient attention paid to the possibility of the spread of Johne&rsquo;s disease in the past? Have we learnt lessons to ensure that this spread is halted?</P>
        <P>Farmers are finding it difficult enough to compete, but if there is some condition which is causing waste, where animals are being fed but there is less production, does the Minister accept that this is adding to the problem? What lessons have been learnt and how do they relate to quarantine?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has introduced a number of initiatives. As I said, it has distributed two booklets, one for the farmer and one for the vet. We have also had a short-time strategy involving a training and information seminar for interested private veterinary practitioners, which took place in January last and was attended by 80 vets. It is intended to hold further seminars with Teagasc advisers and the Department in the near future.</P>
        <P>As part of the next phase of the review in 2004, and on the basis of an identified need to generate rapidly increased awareness, Teagasc, the ICOS, Veterinary Ireland and the Department organised a series of workshops. Within the Department, a medium-term strategy involves research and it will include measures such as the evaluation of a number of diagnostic and screening methods for Johne&rsquo;s disease and the interim provision of diagnostic supports at the central veterinary research laboratory. The Department has allocated approximately &euro;400,000 for this purpose over the past two years. The Department is considering consulting the industry and other interested parties on a number of other initiatives which will form a strategy to address Johne&rsquo;s disease. A number of issues must be resolved but we intend to proceed with a pilot initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to the publication of booklets and so on. A farmer in a neighbouring county to mine lost his herd to BSE. He bought another herd but one animal was infected with Johne&rsquo;s disease. He bought those animals under the supervision of the <Col N="1392"/>Department but ended up with a serious Johne&rsquo;s disease problem. Has an effort been made to prevent farmers from selling animals, which have contracted Johne&rsquo;s disease? If a farmer seeks advice from the Department regarding which animals to buy and they subsequently contract Johne&rsquo;s disease, is there an onus on the Department to compensate him?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State partially answered my question regarding the updated methodology for detection. The time lag between taking a sample and getting a result is a major problem. What efforts are being made to fast-track that process? What research developments have taken place?</P>
        <P>Are there concerns about the pasteurisation of milk given the tenuous link between Johne&rsquo;s disease and Crohn&rsquo;s disease in humans? Are the terms of pasteurisation under review?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that 25% of the adult population have poor literacy skills, will the Minister of State consider issuing a video rather than booklets to disseminate information on these issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s suggestion. I would like the pilot scheme to get under way so that all the issues raised can be addressed. There are no concerns about pasteurised milk.</P>

	<P>The modulated funds become available for use in 2006. I will decide on their <Col N="1393"/>use and seek the necessary EU approval in the coming months. My Department is finalising its examination of the relevant options. As part of that examination there has been a widespread public consultation and discussions with stakeholders. The use of modulated funds in 2006 is limited to certain measures. The eligible measures are contained in the Common Agricultural Policy rural development plan, including agri-environment, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry, and the new initiatives introduced as part of the CAP mid-term review are food quality, animal welfare, farm advisory services and meeting standards. My decision on the use of the funds will be informed by the terms and conditions of those measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister comment on last week&rsquo;s rumour that these funds will come under the disadvantaged areas scheme for the current year? If not, are there plans to include the funds under the scheme at a future date if Ireland is still entitled to them following the Minister&rsquo;s negotiations in June?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister plan to focus on issues such as food quality, animal health and meeting standards, which are critically important for the agricultural sector, or will the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs get his hands on the modulated funds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that the discussion with the IFA made the front page of the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>. Perhaps if that discussion had been on the record, the story would not have been published.</P>
        <P>There has been significant consultation and I received more than 60 submissions. One of the difficulties is the funds are available only for one year, 2006, before they become part of the rural development programme. The modulated funds amount to &euro;18.3 million this year and will increase to &euro;33 million next year. A number of initiatives relating to food quality, husbandry, calf rearing and sheep have been undertaken. However, the problem is the animal health issue is so broad that it may be difficult to tie down what we want.</P>
        <P>Options are available, the easiest of which is to provide a top up. I have not decided whether to do that and then re-evaluate the position under the rural development regime, but a number of good initiatives have been proposed. Discussions are taking place with the farming organisations. I met them and my officials are following up while the internal working group is considering the proposals. It is a small sum but I would like it to be used in the most efficient way. The decision must be made by April or May and the modulated funds will not be accessible by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The access decision on rural development has not been made and further discussion at the Agriculture Council is required. I hope a decision will <Col N="1394"/>be made in June but it may take time on the basis of the <i>tour de table</i> that took place last Monday.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 contains an indicative funding allocation of &euro;358 million to the food industry for a range of measures covering capital investment, research, technology and innovation, marketing and promotion and human resources. A total of more than &euro;72 million has been awarded to date in respect of the capital investment scheme administered jointly by my Department and the development agencies.</P>
        <P>The element of the capital investment scheme administered by my Department assists capital projects which are intended to improve marketing and processing in the horticulture, potato, eggs, grain and livestock sectors which do not fall within the remit of the industrial development agencies or are not covered by my Department&rsquo;s on-farm schemes. In general, investments must exceed &euro;100,000 and up to 40% grant aid is available. Following calls for applications in 2002 and 2004, my Department has allocated &euro;30.31 million in respect of 112 projects across the various sectors as follows: grain sector &mdash; 31 projects, &euro;12.60 million awarded; potato sector &mdash; 21 projects, &euro;7.23 million awarded; livestock sector &mdash; 35 projects, &euro;4.08 million awarded; horticulture sector &mdash; 18 projects, &euro;3.64 million awarded; and egg packing sector &mdash; seven projects, &euro;2.76 million awarded.</P>
        <P>The client companies supported by Enterprise Ireland are primarily Irish manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing ten or more people, Firms located in the mid-west are supported by Shannon Development, while firms in the Gaeltacht areas are supported by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. The support mechanisms available from these development agencies to food companies engaged in marketing and processing of agricultural products include non-repayable grants, preference shares and ordinary share capital. The development agencies have also awarded a total of &euro;42 million to client companies towards capital investment activities under the national development plan.</P>
        <P>The measure relating to marketing and promotion is implemented by Bord Bia. The objective of this measure is to support the marketing and promotion of food and drinks products by facilitating the development of new markets and the expansion of current markets. Assistance is provided in the form of individual company support and support for the development of the industry as a whole. Under the NDP to date, almost &euro;30 million has been committed by Bord Bia on these marketing and promotional activities.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1395"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has made a great case for some type of co-ordination in this regard which is not currently in place. In light of that, would he agree we need a single food industry development agency and a comprehensive marketing programme for our indigenous food companies, as set out in the enterprise strategy plan now abandoned by the Government? In that context, why were those two proposals not included in the action plan the Government approved last week? Why has the Department of Agriculture and Food been left out of the loop regarding the implementation plan, in which six other Departments are involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject every comment and submission the Deputy has made. He is making allegations that are totally without foundation. Obviously, Fine Gael has changed policy in recent years in that, when Bord Glas was amalgamated with Bord Bia, the party vehemently opposed the proposal. Now it is advocating a greater rationalisation of organisations. In recent years, Bord Bia has undertaken excellent work and it is being carried out both directly by the Department in funding product development, research and innovation and by the development agencies. More than &euro;300 million has been allocated in the national development plan towards food-related initiatives. A very substantial portion of that allocation has already been drawn down.</P>
        <P>We talked earlier in reply to Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s questions on the potato sector. The Department has provided very substantial funding towards research, innovation, provision of new facilities and marketing of products. The programmes in place are successful and are bringing about real improvements and generating additional employment.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is misrepresenting the report on enterprise strategy too, which did not make recommendations that were food-specific. It made recommendations regarding the general competitiveness and workings of the economy. In my constituency last week, I spoke to several people involved in the artisan and speciality food sector. One thing they mentioned to me was that recently the decrease in insurance costs had been an extremely positive development for such projects, really making them competitive and helping them achieve the scale of costs they desire.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a mushroom task force met some years ago. It reported last year, and departmental officials and I have met it and stakeholders in the industry. They have been under particular pressures regarding products coming from eastern Europe, particularly to the British market, to which we predominantly exported. Those issues are being addressed, and very substantial progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of the mushroom task force. We are conscious of the challenges and opportunities that have arisen as a result of the expansion of the European Union to 25 states. It is not all challenges, since there are opportunities too.</P>

What progress has been made in bringing us up to the standard that operates in France, for example, which seems to have market advantage and, accordingly, a very positive image internationally as a food country?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Good. Judging by the reports that I have had from Bord Bia and departmental officials, it was a very successful conference. Local authorities are facilitating the development of farmers&rsquo; markets throughout the country, and the Office of Public Works, following correspondence between the Minister of State and me, is also anxious to facilitate such development where feasible. Bord Bia, working in conjunction with the various Leader programmes, is eager to develop the farmers&rsquo; markets, which are proving very successful.

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 83 together.</P>
        <P>My Department implemented The <i>force majeure</i> procedure for the single farm payment scheme in accordance with the provisions of Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. Eligible applicants under this measure can have their entitlements based on an average of one or two years during the reference period &mdash; 2000, 2001 and 2002 &mdash; or the alternative reference period &mdash; 1997, 1998 and 1999. If the revised average for applicants eligible on the grounds of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances is less than the average for the three years of the reference period, as happens in some cases, the applicant in question retains the higher three-year average. In such cases, it would be detrimental to the applicant to benefit from the provisions of Article 40.</P>
        <P>To give farmers ample opportunity to avail themselves of this measure, my Department introduced a scheme in December 2003 for the <Col N="1398"/>submission of applications regarding <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances. The scheme was extensively advertised in the national and local press, with an initial closing date of 23 January 2004. Owing to the high level of interest in the measure and difficulties being experienced by certain applicants in obtaining documentary evidence, my Department extended the closing date to 6 February 2004 to give farmers every opportunity to submit an application. We received in excess of 15,000 applications, of which 98% have been processed to finality.</P>
        <P>Provision was made whereby any farmers dissatisfied with the decision of my Department in respect of their application under <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances had the right to appeal. In that regard, the single payment appeals committee, comprising an independent chairman, Mr. John Duggan, and four appeals officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office, was established. I am satisfied that this appeals mechanism provides farmers with an effective means to have their applications reviewed in an independent, fair, comprehensive and efficient manner if they are not satisfied with my Department&rsquo;s decision in their case.</P>
        <P>Following the issue of statements of provisional entitlements in September 2004, my Department granted farmers who had not already done so a further opportunity to submit applications regarding <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances. We have received in excess of 3,000 such applications. The deadline for submission of applications under this phase of the scheme was 29 October 2004. All unsuccessful applicants will continue to have a right of appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the timescale provided for submission of applications and the procedures introduced for processing applications under <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances regarding the establishment of entitlements under the single payment scheme are comprehensive, effective and fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the substantial number of farmers who have not yet received notification of the single farm payment can still apply for the <i>force majeure</i> payment when they eventually get the single farm payment notification. Despite that such a process is in place, there appears to be a huge variation throughout the country in terms of success rates. For example, the lowest success rates are in the Minister&rsquo;s county, Kerry and Laois&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>No political interference there, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;compared with a success rate in my own county of almost 26%, 25% in Sligo and 32% in Meath. Those were the figures available to me at the time; I am sure they have changed since. In general, the majority of cases have been unsuccessful. Is it not the case also that <Col N="1399"/>almost 99% of the cases that were appealed were unsuccessful, yet we still have this variation throughout the country, which gives rise to questions about the fairness of the system? Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I evaluated that because it is something I heard from my own back bench colleagues. The Deputy is talking about a 22% success rate overall. The number of cases received at the time was 15,288, nearly all of which have been processed. The number of successful applicants was 3,331. When independent appeals took place, 10% were found in favour of the applicant.</P>
        <P>A number of issues arise. The regulation is quite strict and there are only a number of categories in which one can be considered &mdash; death of a farmer, long-term professional incapacity, a natural disaster, accidental destruction of livestock, buildings and holdings or an episodic disease affecting all or part of a farmer&rsquo;s livestock. The regulation is fairly restrictive. People who have a genuine need have the opportunity to appeal. I appreciate that not everyone will get through the scheme. People who have not been dealt with so far still have an opportunity to go through the system. There would be those also, as the Deputy is aware, who would not have a hope in hell of getting through the system. They have as much attachment to the land as the man on the moon but they will still try to get their single farm payment. That is to the detriment of genuine applicants because a considerable amount of resources were required to evaluate those applications. My Department officials are doing their utmost to be as fair as possible in the confines of the articles and terms and conditions to which they have to adhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>A part-time farmer who has applied for installation aid cannot get time off from his employer to go through the processes involved. Could that farmer apply under the <i>force majeure</i> procedure to have his installation aid restored without doing the examination or will the Department consider putting a mechanism in place to help people like that gentleman and several others who cannot get time off from their employers? Perhaps they could do the course on an evening or weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different issue because it is does not concern entitlement. The Deputy is talking about access to a specific installation aid which supports young farmers who want to get into farming. It is like the case of somebody who took up the farm retirement scheme but now wants to go back to farming. There may be issues with regard to having the opportunity to participate in education.</P>
        <P>The larger farming organisations would be of the view that only those who participate in full-time education should have that entitlement of progressing to installation aid. We are evaluating <Col N="1400"/>the educational requirements from a young farmer&rsquo;s perspective but, as the Deputy knows, the pull is between farming organisations that only wish to support those in full-time farming and the many part-time farmers who we want to support. With regard to installation aid, it would not be a <i>force majeure</i> case because such cases are mainly based on illness and death.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said that some people would not have a hope in hell of getting aid because they have no attachment to the land but does she agree that a small number of people never claimed any type of payment and now, through no fault of theirs in terms of the farming practices they adopted, their land has devalued dramatically as a result of this new policy? Has the Minister considered that small group of people and, if not, will she consider assisting them in some manner? Many widows have lost out dramatically and, when the land comes up for rent, its value will be reduced dramatically in the year ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was being facetious when I spoke earlier, although some people will chance their arm like anybody else. There are people who have particular reasons for not applying, including widows and so on, and it may be considered within the <i>force majeure</i> process, perhaps under the national reserve. I am trying not to go beyond the 3% threshold because that means that whoever gets their entitlements will have to give back to the national reserve a certain amount of entitlements, and none of us would like to face the farming fraternity if that were the case. Having said that, there are particular hardship cases and we try to do our utmost, on an individual basis, to determine if something can be done for them. There are those who just never bothered to apply. They may have had their own reasons for that. We may have a situation where some people will not take up their entitlements. They will revert back in that case.</P>
        <P>We are restricted by the article and the terms and conditions but if the Deputy is aware of a particular case involving hardship, we will try to support those people if it is at all possible. I cannot guarantee anything because the person had to be in the scheme at the time of the reference years. We went back to the 1980s on the basis of destocking, particularly on the sheep side of which the Deputy will be aware. We have looked at permutations and the division by one, two and three as to what can be done, but if the Deputy wants a particular case examined or if he has further information, we will try to facilitate those who are suffering hardship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister satisfied that all those cases applied for under health reasons have got a fair hearing? I have come across some cases I understood would have come under the <i>force majeure</i> process for genuine health reasons but were told they did not have a hope. They are <Col N="1401"/>appealing but it is depressing for somebody who suffers from depression not to have their situation taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We must move on to Question No. 74.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not want to reply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not recollect a question being asked but the Minister may reply if she wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hardship issues are not considered within the European Commission or the Union. We try to facilitate hardship issues as best we can. As much medical information as possible must be put forward and it must be such that the person is not physically in a position to carry out a farming enterprise within the reference year. That is the problem. Someone could break a leg but still be able to farm.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>All of us in the farming fraternity must address the issue of depression. Unfortunately, depression is very difficult to deal with from a clinical point of view but if additional information from a psychiatrist were part of the appeals process, I would hope that would support the applicant. I appreciate that from a clinical viewpoint it is very difficult to determine whether depression would restrict a person, within the reference years, in their farming practice.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred earlier to it being a case of &ldquo;a stitch in time&rdquo;, in medical terms, in respect of people visiting their GPs. Those with medical cards can receive treatment at the appropriate time rather than being obliged to do without it. The fear of losing their medical cards is a major disincentive for these people to take up even low paid employment and their relationship with poverty is thus maintained.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The number of full medical cardholders has dropped dramatically from 38.3% of the population in 1983 to 25.7%. This decrease occurred despite the target in the programme for Government to have 200,000 new medical cards. The GP-only medical card will merely be a substitute for the real thing and I do not know whether the same service will be provided to those who possess such cards. These medical cards should, however, at least cover prescription costs or a significant proportion thereof. The payment of &euro;85 per month for medicine represents a major outlay for those on low or even reasonably high incomes.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The timescale relating to the introduction-implementation of GP-only medical cards is a matter which requires urgent attention. A number of community welfare officers do not know what is happening in respect of these cards. The fact that no monetary guidelines have been issued in respect of the cards is making life difficult for everyone involved, particularly people living on the fringes. Not everyone in receipt of social welfare payments qualifies for a medical card. Income guidelines have not kept pace with social welfare increases and this has given rise to certain problems. The guidelines should at least have been index linked. There should be no question that people in receipt of social welfare payments should not be entitled to a medical card. Many people who previously qualified for full medical cards will no longer qualify. No one can claim that people living on social welfare payments are living in luxury. As stated earlier, there should be a moratorium on the withdrawal of medical cards until the doctor-only cards are introduced.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Supreme Court judgment on the controversial Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004, this legislation makes provision for the imposition of charges on elderly people in nursing homes and in full-time care. A great deal of money was taken illegally from people in the past <Col N="1403"/>and one presumes this will have to be repaid to them. It must be recognised that money taken in 1976 has lost its purchasing power and there is no point returning it to people now. In that context and if we use the formula used by health boards, namely, the addition of compound interest at a rate of 7% per annum, we will discover that a pound taken in 1976 is now worth in excess of &euro;9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised by the fact that a Minister of State has been charged with taking the Bill. It is inappropriate that this should be the case. The T&aacute;naiste should be present for the debate on a Bill of this magnitude and importance.</P>
    </Speaker><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State opposite is from the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, but the senior Minister at the Department of Health and Children should be present for the debate. It is a reflection on the House and on the public in general that neither the T&aacute;naiste nor any of her Ministers of State is present.</P>
      <P>The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004, which was introduced before Christmas, was rushed legislation. Such legislation is almost always bad. The Bill before us is also being rushed through the House and will be the subject of a guillotine at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow. Members will not have had an opportunity to discuss it in the time available.</P>
      <P>I wish to put a direct question to the T&aacute;naiste in respect of private nursing homes. Has she obtained legal advice on the position of private patients in private nursing homes? Did she request such advice and has she received it? If she has not requested it, will she please do so and communicate the details of it to Members when she receives it? A serious legal issue has arisen in respect of private patients in private nursing homes in terms of whether they are covered in the same way as medical card holders in public hospitals and nursing homes are covered. I meet people on a daily basis who have been forced to enter private nursing homes &mdash; they are paid a subvention to facilitate this &mdash; because when they applied, through their relevant health board or through the Health Service Executive for places in public hospitals or nursing homes no such places were available. These patients are entitled to full coverage in the homes to which I refer. The T&aacute;naiste should either outline the advice she has received in respect of that matter or seek such advice and pass it on to Members.</P>
      <P>As regards medical cards, this is another issue on which the Government has reneged. In the most recent general election we were promised that 200,000 full medical cards would be provided. That promise has not been kept. I predict that in a short number of years there will be more &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; or doctor-only medical cards than <Col N="1404"/>full medical cards. These cards represent a way to undermine the entire medical card system. The promise relating to medical cards that was made during the general election campaign should be kept. People who suffer from conditions such as asthma should be entitled to full medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a dual purpose Bill. First, it gives effect to those parts of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 that were found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court and, second, it introduces the GP-only medical card announced by the Government last November. These are two distinct and separate matters and I must question their inclusion in one Bill. I also question the rush to enact the first part of the legislation in the absence of clarification on how those people wrongly charged by the State for long-term residential care are to be reimbursed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Government is moving swiftly to ensure that those inpatients receiving long-stay care who can be charged following the Supreme Court judgment will be charged as soon as possible. There is no similar rush to repay those unlawfully charged over a period of many years. In the memorandum to the Bill, the estimated cost of the loss of income to the State since 9 December 2004, when charging was stopped, is &euro;2 million per week. Where is the estimate for what those mostly elderly and infirm people are owed by the State?</P>
      <P>We have been informed that a Cabinet sub-committee has been formed to decide on the scheme of reimbursement. However, I detected a distinct lack of urgency on the part of the Government. It is certainly in contrast to the swift production of this Bill. This is all the more unacceptable, given that we now know about the extent of the knowledge within the Department of Health and Children and successive Governments about illegal charging of long-stay patients over many years. The system knew people were being wrongly charged but did nothing to stop it. Since this issue came to light there has been widespread concern and confusion among the families of people in long-stay residential care. Following the Supreme Court judgment, they are still none the wiser about the next steps to be taken and the implications for their personal circumstances. We learned this week that the Health Service Executive had allocated only six staff members to the dedicated helpline. An additional four staff has made no appreciable difference as long delays in answering calls are still experienced. I tried that line before coming into the House for the recommencement of this debate and I had to hang up in total frustration after waiting for a long period.</P>
      <P>My fellow Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and I have had many inquiries to our offices on this matter. I presume other Deputies have been contacted by many people seeking information, and there is none. There is a dearth of information. The State&rsquo;s response to date has been disgraceful. The Government must start to make decisions and get <Col N="1405"/>the information out to the general public. Above all, it must repay all those entitled to repayment.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the second part of the Bill, the doctor-only medical card. What has become known as the &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; medical card appeared out of the blue last year. Whether it was inspired by the blue sky over Inchydoney is anybody&rsquo;s guess. There was no indication previously that the Government would take this route. During the 2002 general election campaign, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party promised to provide a further 200,000 people with medical cards. It is often forgotten that the PDs made a similar promise when its manifesto in 2002 ensured eligibility criteria would at least keep pace with movement in income. Not only have the promises of both coalition partners not been fulfilled, but the situation has gone into reverse. There are now 64,478 fewer people with medical cards than when those promises were made in 2002. There are 109,767 fewer people with medical cards than in 1997 when the current coalition came into Government. It gets worse, however. In January this year 6,296 people lost their qualification for medical cards. The figure for the month before was 2,068, so since Deputy Harney took over as Minister for Health and Children well over 8,000 further people have lost their medical cards. Where does this leave the Minister&rsquo;s estimate that in the region of 200,000 should qualify for the doctor-only medical card?</P>
      <P>It is a convenient figure for the Government, which has been haunted since 2002 by its own extravagant promises. Does the figure have any meaning? The reality is that many of these cards will go to people who were previously entitled to full medical cards but who lost them because their incomes rose above the disgracefully low level of the income guidelines.</P>
      <P>On budget day, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children, asking the approximate cost of the doctor-only card compared to full medical card. She stated that the doctor-only card would cost approximately &euro;250 per year while the annual cost of the full medical card is &euro;1,000. Both in terms of the numbers qualifying and the value of the new card, it is clear that Government&rsquo;s claim of generosity is by no means all that it would like the public to believe. We also have to take into consideration the Government&rsquo;s hiking of hospital charges and medicine costs to see that it is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. While the extension of free GP services is welcome, as far as it goes &mdash; how far remains to be seen &mdash; the Government cannot fool people into thinking they are getting the full value of the medical card. They will still bear the heavy cost of medicines, which together with hospital charges, represent three-quarters of the value of the real medical card.</P>
      <P>This Government has been responsible for a succession of steep rises in the costs of medicine. Those who fare worst are people whose incomes <Col N="1406"/>are just above the medical card income guidelines and who must take regular medication. A year ago they had to pay &euro;70 a month before they were entitled to a refund under the drugs payments scheme. After two rises in the threshold over the past 12 months, they must now pay &euro;85 per month. For people on low incomes, especially those dependent on ongoing medication for their very lives, this is a disgraceful rise.</P>
      <P>This Bill maintains the myth that entitlement to a medical card is based on undue hardship. The reality is that the entitlement is based on income guidelines drawn up by the Minister and her Department within the constraints set by the Minister for Finance in the annual Estimates. Only in the most exceptional circumstances will people above those income guidelines be considered for a medical card, no matter how much undue hardship they and their dependents experience. All Deputies, without exception, will have had experience of representing people in such circumstances who have been denied medical cards. This Bill introduces a further euphemism. It states doctor-only cards will go to people for whom payment of GP fees would be &ldquo;unduly burdensome&rdquo;. Again the reality is dictated by the income guidelines and not by the individual circumstances of each applicant, no matter how heavy the burden they may carry.</P>
      <P>This Bill in both its parts, adds another rickety extension to a ramshackle, ill-planned, inequitable and inefficient health service. It comes at a time when the Minister, Deputy Harney, is accelerating the development of private medicine and giving favoured treatment to the private health business. The accident and emergency crisis continues in all our hospitals. Local hospitals are being denuded of services, including those in my own constituency. The development of primary care, supposedly the cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s health strategy, has been put on the long finger.</P>
      <P>The Government may be rushing this Bill through in time for the by-elections. The Minister denied there was any connection when I asked her this question about a week ago. However, I do not believe the good people of Meath or Kildare will be fooled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am tempted to say to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that it might do his party the world of good to visit that place of pilgrimage in Cork. They might take their scriptwriters too, and it might change their attitude.</P>
      <P>To be serious, I have been listening carefully to the debate. I listened in particular to the Minister of State this morning. There has been some talk as to what Minister should have been here and I will not get involved in that. However, I have great admiration for the work of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, and what he does in the Department. He blazes a trail struck for him by Deputy Callely, who certainly impressed greatly as regards services for the elderly, in the short <Col N="1407"/>time he was at the Department. Deputy Se&aacute;n Power&rsquo;s speech this morning was measured, particularly as regards services for all the people. He also made the point, in fairness, about the doctor-only medical cards. The term &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; has a good soundbite, and perhaps that is all right, but we should be careful about upsetting people who wish to qualify for such medical cards. Perhaps we should find a different phrase. The occasional soundbite is all right, but let us remember the Government is trying to create a situation whereby people on lower incomes qualify.</P>
      <P>As a Government backbencher I support the view that we should help those who are in need of medical cards. Since I have picked on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in I will give some credit to Deputy Crowe who has made the point, as I often have, that the best way to get people out of the poverty trap is through employment. Many people in my constituency often make the point that where they are unemployed, receiving different assistance benefits and want to go to work or into full-time education, it is often difficult to make such a decision because they must do it in the knowledge that they will lose benefits. There is often an issue with medical cards, although the situation has improved a little in recent years.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on issues related to the provision of services for older people and to support what the Government is doing in that regard. I speak as a representative of the constituency of Dublin South-West where there is a young population, particularly in Tallaght, but also in Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and Brittas. There are also many elderly people in those communities and I am always happy to support the groups that look after them. The significant progress which has been made in the growth of funding available for this sector is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the ongoing development of health funded services for older people.</P>
      <P>One of the great achievements of western societies in the 20th century has been the increase in life expectancy. As the standard of living for the young and middle aged in this country has risen, so the quality of life of successive generations is improving. Modern medicine, social policies, political will and community enterprise mean that more people live longer and more fulfilling lives. The majority of older people are healthy and fit and hold good positive attitudes. I recently spoke to a gentleman in my clinic who let slip that he was aged 81. I was astonished and it is great to see that kind of attitude in our elderly.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that there are more than 60 million people in the European Union who are aged 60 and over. Figures from the Central Statistics Office collated from the results of the census suggest that the average age of the population is increasing. Projections based on the <Col N="1408"/>1996 census indicate that in 1996, 11.5% of the Irish population was over 65. Forecasts suggest that 18% to 21 % of the population will be aged over 65 by 2031. The Government is aware of this trend and addressed some of these issues in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, published in 2001. The Government is committed to developing services for older people, both residential and community based, to meet the needs of our growing older population. We know there are economic and financial consequences of people living longer. Each generation of people in their active years must accept responsibility towards the support of the elderly.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people can clearly be demonstrated by outlining the resources made available in recent years for service developments. In excess of &euro;287 million in additional funding was provided for health services for older people between 1997 and 2004. This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to improving services for our older population. In 2005, a further &euro;15.228 million in additional funding was allocated to services for older people. This funding is being used for a variety of services, including the nursing home subvention scheme, the home care grant scheme, home help service, elder abuse programmes and support for voluntary organisations. Since 1993 there has been an unprecedented level of investment in the nursing home subvention scheme. A total of &euro;5 million was allocated for the scheme when it was introduced in 1993. The total expenditure on the scheme in 2005 will be &euro;120 million.</P>
      <P>In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme was undertaken by the Department of Health and Children in association with the Department of Finance. The review was carried out by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea and the objectives of the review were to examine the objectives of the 1993 nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which they remained valid, to assess the service delivered and to establish what scope, if any, existed for achieving the programme objectives by other more efficient and effective means. Professor O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s report, Review of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme, was launched in June 2003 simultaneously with the Mercer report, Study on the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Community supports are vital to maintain older people in their homes for as long as possible. Long-stay nursing care should only be a last option in care planning for older people, with the community supports acting as a real support for older people who wish to live in dignity and independence in their community. Numerous studies have highlighted that older people would prefer to remain living at home rather than going into <Col N="1409"/>long-stay care. The Government is committed to developing the various community and home support schemes. The total expenditure on the home help service in 2005 will be &euro;118.75 million. I would like to be unusually parochial and mention my support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to mention my support for the Tallaght home help services which provide great service. If I do not tell the House where I am from, the Deputies will not know so I have to remind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not forget to mention Marino as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned those places in the Deputy&rsquo;s absence. I am happy to record my strong support for the Tallaght home help service which is part of the Tallaght welfare society.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive areas have piloted home care grant schemes as an alternative to long-term residential care to assist older people living at home in the community. Older people who are discharged from the acute hospital system, as well as those living in the community, are targeted under these schemes. In the HSE eastern regional area, people have been discharged from acute hospitals under the Sl&aacute;n Abhaile and Home First pilot projects. In the HSE southern area, a similar project, C&uacute;ram, has been piloted. The Department of Health and Children has been working with the HSE to develop a national home care grant scheme. A draft of the scheme is being finalised by the HSE for presentation to the Department. Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2005 to introduce the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that there is insufficient provision of public long-term care beds to cater for the growing elderly population with a resultant over-reliance on the private nursing home sector. I served on the Eastern Regional Health Authority along with Deputy Mitchell and other colleagues and am brave enough to lament its passing. I know it might get me into trouble in some quarters but I am not that happy about its passing. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Area Health Board are particularly affected because of a lack of public long-term care beds. This was acknowledged when the Department of Health and Children was preparing the health strategy and there is a commitment in the strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, 600 additional day hospital beds and facilities encompassing specialist areas such as treatment for falls and osteoporosis, fracture prevention, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and other prob<Col N="1410"/>lems. In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care community nursing unit places over a seven-year period that would include the provision of long-term care beds for people with dementia.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, capital funding of over &euro;253 million is being made available for the provision of services for older people in the period 2000 to 2006. On a national basis, this will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day care facilities to be put in place as well as the refurbishment of existing extended care facilities and the replacement of older unsuitable accommodation. The House will recall that I mentioned the elder abuse programme. The publication of the report, Protecting Our Future, in late 2002 was a momentous occasion for the elderly in this country. They were given a blueprint to deal with the scourge of elder abuse and a pledge that this blueprint would be implemented. Up to recently, there was a feeling that elder abuse did not exist in this country, but the report confirms that there is a problem, the extent and nature of which remains to be identified.</P>
      <P>By defining elder abuse and recommending implementation of structures to deal with suspected cases, the report will, I hope, give older people who feel they are the victims of it the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to social workers, public health nurses, garda&iacute;, professionals or care workers. While the report is the first attempt to deal with elder abuse, it is still an important one. As abuse can come in many shapes and forms, there is need to make the general public more aware of the problem. It is even more important to target relevant service providers to make them aware of the steps taken to respond to elder abuse and the procedures that will be available to deal with it. I hope greater awareness of the problem will lead to lessening of its incidence.</P>
      <P>As recommended in the report, a national implementation group has been established. A number of the report&rsquo;s recommendations are based on experience gained from two pilot projects. Despite the absence of major publicity, sufficiently serious and numerous cases have come to light to justify the process. The Department of Health and Children is determined to press ahead with gradual implementation of the report. Funding of &euro;800,000 was provided in 2003 to commence implementation of the elder abuse programme. Last year, an additional &euro;750,000 was allocated to each health board area to ensure the continued implementation of the programme, including the appointment of case workers. An additional &euro;900,000 has been allocated for 2005.</P>
      <P>I concur with the broad thrust of the report, which recommends placing the response to elder abuse in the wider context of health and social care services for older people. As the number of older people rises, we should not forget that they have been instrumental in building the healthy <Col N="1411"/>State we enjoy today. Their contribution to the economy is widely acknowledged and the Government is fully committed to improving all aspects of their lives by focusing on issues that affect their well-being. The cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s health policy is to keep older people living in their own homes for as long as possible. To remain at home has been shown in research as the preferred choice of older people. All Members will have seen this finding corroborated through their constituency work.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report will help to ensure the observation of the fundamental right of older people to be treated with respect in their twilight years. The starting point for making the changes called for in the report may well involve each of us reflecting on our attitudes to older people. We must begin to question our attitude to older people to satisfy ourselves that we do not harbour the in-built negative feelings towards them, which can often be the source of unintentional abuse. We must proceed on a journey during which we absorb much and learn to cope with what may be considerable fallout.</P>
      <P>In November 2004, the T&aacute;naiste announced additional funding of &euro;70 million to implement a ten-point action plan to improve delivery of emergency services. The T&aacute;naiste met senior management of the Health Service Executive with which the Department of Health and Children is working closely to ensure early implementation of the plan. The measures outlined in the plan include transfer of 100 high-dependency patients to suitable private nursing home care, negotiation with the private sector to meet the needs of 500 people annually for intermediate care of up to six weeks and the expansion of home-care packages to support an additional 500 older people at home. Funding of &euro;16.8 million to the former Eastern Regional Health Authority will result in more than 600 patients being discharged to more appropriate settings. A total of &euro;5 million was provided to the former Southern Area Health Board under the delayed-discharges initiative 2003-04 to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute hospital system.</P>
      <P>It will be clear to the House from my contribution that the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna F&aacute;il have an undeniable commitment to older people. While we acknowledge the need to avoid complacency about the continuing development of services to meet growing demand, the Government and its immediate predecessor can be proud of their record to date. We are aware that we must continue with our efforts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have mentioned the following earlier, but I was trying to avoid being too parochial. I have been particularly pleased by significant recent developments in the care of the elderly in the Tallaght area. There was no nursing home in the area for a long time, but one has been operating at Kiltipper Woods for several months. It is a tremendous facility, the work of which I support strongly.</P>
      <P>While the Ceann Comhairle would not encourage me to tell a story, I often think of my late uncle who died at 93 a few years ago in the context of discussions of care for the elderly. As I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, discuss the way the Government has <Col N="1413"/>developed services, I remembered my uncle Mick calling me to come close for him to tell me that while the home he was in was great and he was well fed, the only problem was that it was full of old people. Perhaps that sums up the way we should treat and care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>I appreciate fully the measure of the contribution older people continue to make to society. Older people have a wealth of experience that can be harnessed and embraced for the good of the country and our communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, but it is absolutely outrageous that the Minister for Health and Children is not present. There is nothing more important on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s agenda than this Bill. Despite having got it wrong once, she does not appear to care that she might get it wrong again. There is nothing more important for her to do than to attend to listen to this debate. When the Bill was before the Supreme Court, her senior counsel argued on her behalf that it would be catastrophic for the State if the charges were found retrospectively to be illegal. While it was found that the charges were illegal and that the money must be repaid, the T&aacute;naiste has not bothered to come to the House to deal with the catastrophe. We should ask what signal her failure to attend sends to taxpayers and the people affected by the court&rsquo;s decision.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the T&aacute;naiste is not present, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation as I did not have a chance to discuss the failed Bill which passed through the House before Christmas. It is small wonder that the Bill was struck down by the Supreme Court as we all know rushed legislation is never sound. Even if it does not constitute an outrageous attempt to legalise a practice retrospectively, rushed legislation is of no use. I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste was motivated by naivety, poor advice or absolute desperation in attempting to legalise charges retrospectively, but her approach was doomed to failure. The Supreme Court has clarified the position and restitution must be paid.</P>
      <P>While the matter was before the court, a rush of blood to the head prompted another poor and ill-considered decision to pay everyone affected &euro;2,000. At this stage she must be learning, albeit, the hard way, to be very wary of advice from the Department, because good advice is based on good information. Despite worthy people in the Department and the best of intentions, the reality is that they do not have good information. They only have a very tenuous grasp of what is really happening on the ground, which is why, year after year, budgets over-run in hospitals and health boards and time bombs continue to go off in the health service yet nobody ever seems to see them coming.</P>
      <P>I asked several parliamentary questions last week to try to elicit the exact extent of the State&rsquo;s liability following the Supreme Court decision. The answers were much as I expected in that they <Col N="1414"/>basically have not got a clue. That is the reality. No matter what they say about it being &euro;500 million or &euro;2 billion depending on how far back one goes, the reality is that they do not know. How could they possibly know? The information may be there somewhere, but it seems utterly irretrievable. One cannot retrieve any kind of information regarding the health service. When the Department introduced medical cards for the over-70s, it could not tell how many people over the age of 70 were alive. How could it possibly know the number who have died over the past 30 years, as well as those alive today?</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has promised a Supplementary Estimate later in the year to pay for this mess. The Minister of State can pass the message on to her that it may be the first Estimate to pay for this, but it will not be the last. It will be years before we know how much this will cost. Not only do we not know the numbers involved or how far back we will have to go in repaying people, we also do not know whether repayments will reflect the value of the charges at the time they were levied or the current value.</P>
      <P>The situation is also not clear with regard to people who had medical cards or partial eligibility and could not get into public beds. Several people have raised this appalling matter. Ignoring the problem will not solve it because it will keep coming up and the Government will have to face up to it. Legally the State must repay charges paid for those in public beds. If there is one group with a genuine grievance, it is those forced into private nursing homes despite, in many cases, having medical cards and circumstances which entitled them to some form of help in terms of getting into a State-run home or a public bed in a private nursing home. These people were on low incomes, and many were pauperised and spent their entire savings paying for a nursing home. They sold their homes and once that was gone their children had to take over payments at the very time they were trying to raise their own families and had big demands on their resources. The Minister must deal with these people in a fair and open manner and reimburse them.</P>
      <P>Reimbursement must not be made dependent on whether people can produce a written application form for a public bed, as has been suggested. The Minister, and any public representative who has had any dealings with the elderly, will be aware that the allocation of nursing beds was, at best, <i>ad hoc</i>, and probably in most cases absolutely chaotic. There was no formal system of application and no consistency of application, either geographically or over time. Clients in precisely the same financial circumstances in different health board areas were dealt with in a completely different manner simply because some areas had larger numbers of public beds than others. For example, I read that Donegal had a huge number of public nursing home beds relative to the population compared to a built-up area such as Dublin.</P><Col N="1415"/>
      <P>In some cases, people were moved into a public bed in order to vacate a bed in an acute hospital, where demand for beds was greater than in other hospitals and a higher turnover was needed. This was done whether people could afford it or not, and in many cases they could well afford a nursing home bed. Sometimes the situation depended on the time of the budgetary year, in that one had a better chance of getting a contract bed in January than in December when health board budgets were exhausted. There was no consistency, application forms or clarity surrounding the matter. Over the years, many people parted with far greater sums of money than the 80% of old age pensions about which we are now speaking. If they are not included in at least the same level of compensation the T&aacute;naiste can look forward to spending much more time in the courts dealing with that problem.</P>
      <P>There are estimates regarding the amount that is owed, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. The actual exposure of the taxpayer is completely unknown, which is why the T&aacute;naiste should be here listening to this. Deputy O&rsquo;Connor gave us a stream of consciousness which did not deal with this problem in any way. This is the biggest catastrophe for the taxpayer and the elderly in many years, and it is being made to appear as a slight little hiccup in the overall process of Government.</P>
      <P>So far we have had no accountability. Nobody wants to sit up and say, &ldquo;This is my fault.&rdquo; No heads have rolled and no one has acknowledged any sense of responsibility. The taxpayer will just have to pay up and shut up and that is the end of it. If a private sector company overcharged the public, we would be here jumping up and down saying the company must repay moneys. If the shareholders realised the kind of liability that had been built up, they would have given the board of management their walking papers long ago. Unfortunately, taxpayers are not in the happy position to do that but they will vent their anger eventually.</P>
      <P>We do not yet have the Travers report regarding how this situation happened and how it was allowed to drift for so long. I was a member of the health board and, whatever happened before 2001, following the report of the Ombudsman and the introduction of the medical card for the over-70s, everybody with anything to do with the health service knew there was a problem with regard to charging. Since 2001 public representatives have been receiving queries about the legality of charges. Health board members knew this was a potential problem and it was discussed in and between health boards and the Department. It is unbelievable that the Minister did not know about it. If she did not know, then the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, was even more removed from reality than I thought at time. It was the topic of conversation. Even the previous Minister&rsquo;s much-vaunted reform programme was <Col N="1416"/>very much informed by the recognition of the growing cost of care of the elderly. The legality of charges, their lack of consistency and clarity, the subventions and their inadequacy, the failure to increase the subventions, the implications for the public purse of the medical card for the over-70s and the entitlement to nursing homes were all constant topics of discussion among everybody involved in the health services.</P>
      <P>On top of all that came the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report and the subsequent debate about the distinction between entitlement and eligibility, behind which the Government is still hiding. There was then a promise in the health strategy of legislation to clarify the distinction between eligibility and entitlement which we still do not have. It was not faced up to because this problem would have come to light. It is inconceivable that the then Minister for Health and Children, in a period of intense debate surrounding the issue of the cost of care for the elderly, somehow never heard a hint that the charges for nursing homes had a questionable legal basis. Without a doubt, he had more than a hint, as had his Department. He and the Department undoubtedly reached a very comfortable accommodation with each other which was a mutually beneficial arrangement. He agreed not to rock their boat and they agreed not to rock his. I am not suggesting there was explicit collusion, but there was definitely implicit collusion. A decision was made to allow the position to drift and to go on indefinitely. It was not faced up to in 2001, 2002 and 2003, so the bill for the taxpayer increased. It suited the then Minister to have a soft landing out of the Department and perhaps the whole matter could be swept under the carpet until after a general election. If it was not for the efforts of Deputies Kenny and Perry the matter would never have come to light. In short, the T&aacute;naiste was dropped in it because clearly she did not have her finger on the pulse of what was happening in the Department of Health and Children. The previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is off to Australia but I would say it is not far enough as far as the T&aacute;naiste is concerned.</P>
      <P>I support the notion of charges for health services, including nursing homes. It is perfectly reasonable that people should make a contribution towards nursing home accommodation costs from their pensions. It is becoming clear that everybody is now eligible for a nursing home bed and the maximum they will have to pay is 80% of their pension. I would love to think that is what will be facing me and everyone else, but that was never envisaged when medical cards were introduced for the over-70s. It was never budgeted for and it is certainly not affordable without a major change in our tax system. We are not talking about small Supplementary Estimates; it is a major change in the fiscal system, if that can be afforded. That provision is not being faced up to in this Bill.</P><Col N="1417"/>
      <P>I can tell the Minister of State &mdash; I wish the T&aacute;naiste was here to listen &mdash; that this matter will eventually end up in the Supreme Court. Whether it intended to do so or not, the Government has created a legitimate expectation among the public that they are entitled to a nursing home bed and that all they will have to pay is 80% of their old age pension. Sooner or later that fact will have to be recognised but it has not been faced up to in the Bill. Unfortunately, that means the taxpayer will once again end up with a big bill when the matter is referred to the courts and ends up in the Supreme Court. It is a difficult nettle to grasp but it must be dealt with, otherwise it will be allowed to drift.</P>
      <P>People can reasonably say they do not need to make provision for the future through savings as they are all entitled to a nursing home bed. The queuing system for acute hospital beds that operated in the past will not work in this case. One can only go so far in arguing about the distinction between eligibility and entitlement. The previous Minister for Health and Children promised to clarify that legislative aspect, but the clarification has not been made. It must be clarified, however, otherwise we will end up forever in the courts with a taxpayers&rsquo; bill exceeding the appalling vista we already face with retrospective payments of God knows how much. At the same time, services will have to be reduced across all health programmes.</P>
      <P>This position is truly catastrophic, as was argued in the Supreme Court, for the elderly and the taxpayer. We are still burying our heads in the sand as regards what future provision is required to accommodate the elderly in nursing homes. There is a retrospective difficulty but we are building up an even bigger one for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. We are all well aware of the reason this legislation is before the House; it is to create a legal framework to apply a reasonable level of charge for the maintenance element of long-term, public residential care units and to create the legal process whereby 200,000 extra people can be granted medical cards which will permit a doctor&rsquo;s visit without charge.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to extend the provision of medical cards. The number of additional cards is estimated at 200,000. We have had an assurance that if the figure employed for eligibility &mdash; that is, 25% above the current level &mdash; does not lead to an extra 200,000 people obtaining cards, it will be modified to do so. A sum of &euro;60 million has been allocated to that end.</P>
      <P>Over the years, many representatives of all parties on health boards and elsewhere have requested such facilities. Various descriptions were used, including limited liability, but it basically concerned the introduction of a second type of medical card. That concept was strongly supported over the years. I have heard the request being made by members of all political parties at <Col N="1418"/>public meetings, on health boards and on the Committee on Health and Children. Many interest groups, including GPs, have sought a similar facility. The rationale behind the request for GP-only medical cards was that in many instances no treatment, other than a doctor&rsquo;s examination and reassurance, is required for patients. The cost of visiting a GP was an inhibiting factor for some people. In some instances, parents became sick from stress and anxiety over their concerns for their children&rsquo;s health. GPs have made the case that often a simple examination can reassure a patient and if further treatment is necessary they can point them in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The worst possible form of politics is for party spokespersons to try to denigrate this positive and constructive move by labelling these cards as &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo;, thus suggesting that they are of little or no benefit. The latest attempt in this regard was made by our friend in Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. He said that others referred to the cards as &ldquo;yellow packs&rdquo;, but that was just adding the same tag to them. Not only is this the worst possible type of politics but it is also patently untrue to say the GP-only cards are of no benefit to anyone. Some &euro;60 million will be invested in the scheme this year to the benefit of 200,000 people. Apart from any other aspect, that is proof of the benefits involved.</P>
      <P>The scheme will apply to those who are marginally above the current eligibility limits for medical cards. We have been seeking a re-examination of the situation to target that group and this is now being done. It would be almost impossible to draw up a scheme to provide 200,000 extra medical cards for full eligibility because, as we all know, the cost of drugs is open-ended. Unfortunately, in the past, we found that in many cases there was not much control in this area, even though we had concerns about it. We can quantify the cost of medical cards directly, while we could not do so for the supply of drugs, although there is a separate scheme in place for that. The bottom line is that at least &euro;60 million is being diverted from other areas to a targeted group of people who are less well off.</P>
      <P>Political honesty is required from those who oppose this scheme. There is a clearly identifiable group who require preferential treatment, including targeted services. The GP-only card scheme goes some way towards meeting their needs. This kind of targeting includes the medical cards for the over-70s scheme, which has been opposed by several speakers today. I campaigned to extend that scheme to include the over-65s so they would automatically become eligible for a medical card. Many of my colleagues, from all parties, who served on the Southern Health Board were anxious to implement such a scheme.</P>
      <P>I am intensely annoyed by the mischievous comments that have been made about the proposed scheme, particularly when the commentators were among those who campaigned for <Col N="1419"/>such a scheme over the years. Last night we heard a further outburst in that regard when one Deputy from the west, who shall remain nameless, told us that we were giving medical cards to billionaires. I am sure they are running down to the doctor every day, card in hand, seeking some service. Perhaps his previous claim that we gave cards to millionaires no longer made the headlines, so he changed the story a bit.</P>
      <P>When the occasion demands it the commentators can come in here and paint a vivid picture of the deprivation being suffered by people in certain circumstances. They can make certain cases in an almost tearful manner. In spite of that, if they hold clinics, they know that some of the greatest cases of hardship were among elderly people without a medical card. These people were fortunate enough to have a small private pension, but they were unfortunate in the sense that it resulted in them being over the means threshold for a medical card. Desperation was evident among these elderly who were in need of health care. In some cases that might only amount to reassurance on their health concerns. This group was in need of particular help and attention and I am proud we gave them that assistance.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the scheme for two unfortunate reasons. First, the Departments involved could not supply a figure for the number of people who would be eligible. In other words, as Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated, they did not know the number of people in the country aged over 70. That was a fact. That should not change the concept of giving benefit where it was needed. The second reason is that the IMO, the doctors&rsquo; union, was able to hammer out a very good deal. It certainly got the last ounce out of that measure. I still believe that this was a good decision.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine any millionaire or billionaire going down to join a queue at a doctor&rsquo;s surgery to get the benefit of his or her medical card. That type of emotive statement should not be made. What happens is that because of the negative things that have been said, people will shy away from worthwhile schemes. I ask that people be more positive, especially when dealing with the elderly.</P>
      <P>The critics love to refer to the elderly as the people who built the State. They say that we owe them and should give more to them. However, we indulge in saying the opposite to attack the former Minister, Deputy Martin, or the Minister, Deputy Harney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Dennehy should be allowed to speak without interruption. Deputies will have an opportunity to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s party was on our side for a long time until we granted the cards and then the party voted against us in the House. I believe the IMO is in favour of this scheme. I am sure it will get the same rate as usual.</P>
      <P>I welcome the review of eligibility guidelines for the full medical card. It is expected that at least 30,000 additional people will qualify. The actual increase is 7.5% on the 2004 figure. Two of my former Southern Health Board colleagues are in the House. We had concerns about how the guidelines were reviewed every year by the eight CEOs because their aim was probably to keep the budget as low as possible. The increase was usually 2.5%, but this year it is 7.5%. That will be of considerable benefit.</P>
      <P>A great deal of honest comment and input is required if we are to succeed in establishing a proper system of care for the elderly. People are living longer and our elderly population is growing as a percentage of the population, which may create financial problems. The fiasco of the figures supplied for the over-70s medical cards should not prevent us looking at schemes like this.</P>
      <P>Similarly the figures were incorrect in regard to the initiative which the Government took to benefit old age pensioners living abroad, also people who had built the State. Again, the figures were all wrong but the concept was right. It was the correct thing to do. We must provide for a proper service in the future. We have never achieved this to date.</P>
      <P>The reason we have so many private nursing homes is that the State has failed to provide sufficient long-term care beds. Something has been achieved in terms of acute hospital beds but we have never attempted to provide step-down facilities. We have never handled it properly and we will have to look at that. Private nursing homes have filled that void, admittedly at a cost. They have done a good job. We are facing a changed situation. The age profile of the population is changing. The people who would have looked after family members in the home are no longer there. People are now going out to work who previously would have stayed at home. Many other factors also come into play.</P>
      <P>We will have to look carefully at other options. I refer to home help and home care packages which appear to offer a solution in that people would be paid to provide a facility and the back-<Col N="1421"/>up service would be provided by local authorities. We will have to make decisions and take action quickly on these options.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong of anybody to suggest that we should give somebody who is in full-time care their full old age pension to be put aside for other family members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is saying that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is suggesting that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Dennehy should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not be viable and would not help other areas of the health service. Many people such as carers need assistance. We must use our money to the best possible advantage.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated, we were all concerned at the amount of money being taken in the past. Everyone who served on a health board has had that worry and voiced it in the past. We need to make changes and move on. It is essential that we have a level of charge. I hope the matter can be quickly dealt with and that the people who in the past made a great deal of money from Army deafness claims and other matters will not be the ones to benefit from this issue. It was amazing how quickly the legal profession had advertisements in place &mdash; they were in place almost as soon as the court decision was made. I found that a bit depressing.</P>
      <P>I do not advocate a one-party approach. No doubt we will have arguments as people will hold different opinions. I will voice my concerns at parliamentary party meetings, with Ministers and decision makers. We must have the debate on the future care of the elderly.</P>
      <P>I read a timely article today by Liam O&rsquo;Sullivan, the national development officer for Care Alliance Ireland in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> which referred to that organisation&rsquo;s upcoming conference. It asks questions such as whether we want to live in a society where care of elderly and vulnerable people is provided mainly by paid care workers. I will leave that question hanging. It also asks a number of other questions such as whether we want to facilitate people to stay at home. Every report on the subject has concluded that the elderly wish to be in their own homes and their own environment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Although it is not always possible because of medical reasons, we must try to provide for this. We must have a debate about what can be done, who will fund it, how much it will cost and what is the best way in which to spend the money. All Deputies will support this Bill because they all accept there must be some level of charge. We need to divert money into different aspects of the care of the elderly.</P>
      <P>The article to which I referred is a very balanced piece in which compliments are paid to <Col N="1422"/>the Government for its initiatives as well as criticism where it is due. Anyone interested in this Bill would do well to read it. We must increasingly examine this issue. We know that our elderly population will grow in number, that the dependency level will increase and that there is a shortage of long-term care beds and funding for carers. We also know within reason how much money will be available this year and for the next three or four years if the Government is still in power. We will try to keep the economy going well in any case. Nonetheless, the money will have to be provided.</P>
      <P>Decisions must be made on these issues. For example, Mr. Liam O&rsquo;Sullivan has posed the question whether the public is willing to pay another 2.5% in taxation or PRSI to provide health care for the elderly. The question will never be put that baldly to people but we need to examine the package of money we have and decide on priorities for its use. When the Government does something well, it must be recognised and supported and when it does something wrong, it must take the criticism, which it has done. We will also voice that criticism as quickly as anyone else.</P>
      <P>The medical card was called for by general practitioners and representatives of all parties. It is therefore no good to criticise it now. If we could get another 200,000 people fully covered by the GMS, it would be great, but we are told this is what we can afford. The initiative is a welcome move. The 7.5% increase in the eligibility rates is also welcome and people should congratulate the Government on it. We would like for drugs to be covered next year.</P>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor said that the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly was a step in the right direction. However, we need to continue to move in that direction. Other than holding on to the job for a while, Deputies hope that, when we need it, there will be a good environment and someone to care for us. We will be thankful for it and, I hope, live long enough to enjoy it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that this Bill, unusually, has been introduced to the House without an explanatory memorandum. This has not happened in my short time in the House. It may have occurred in respect of the previous Health Bill, although I am open to correction. This Bill will be sent to the Seanad where, had it been introduced there, would have required an explanatory memorandum under that House&rsquo;s Standing Orders. This matter should be examined in this House. When Bills have come before the Supreme Court in the past, explanatory memorandums have been examined prior to the court <Col N="1423"/>giving its judgment. This is a strange departure from precedent and one which has not been adequately explained by the Minister for Health and Children. I call on her to explain why this is the case.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputies Perry and Kenny for their pursuit of the issue of illegal charging in nursing homes. It is clear from the Supreme Court decision that, despite Government attempts to muddy the waters in recent months and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statements, the issue of overcharging became much more apparent from 2001. Moreover, there is strong evidence to suggest that the Minster for Health and Children at the time, Deputy Martin, and his Ministers of State abdicated their responsibilities in their handling of the issue from December 2003.</P>
      <P>Part of the reason for this Bill being presented is the outcome of this position. It is a shame that the Travers report is not available to the House. We are told we should learn from our mistakes but it is very difficult for the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, current Minister, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, and her Ministers of State when they and we cannot see the report into the handling of the issue before we discuss another Bill which effectively deals with the same issue. This is a pity because it would have been good to have had recourse to the report while discussing the Bill prior to its enactment after Friday, 11 March next.</P>
      <P>I refer to the issue of overall care for the elderly. The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, attempted to deal with the matter in his speech to the House. It is nice to have noble aspirations, a term used by other Ministers in recent times, but we need more than that. We must have long-term planning, not only in terms of public and private nursing home care, but also in terms of the adequate provision of long-term care of the elderly within their homes. There are people who would rather be cared for at home if all the facilities were in place.</P>
      <P>Many inroads have been made in this regard and better facilities have recently been provided for the care of people in their homes than existed ten or 15 years ago. However, we have a long way to go to make it a viable alternative to long-stay nursing home care and we have not yet bridged that gap. This is an important consideration which requires long-term planning because stop-gap measures will not work.</P>
      <P>We will perhaps never reach the optimum number of nursing home beds but we must aspire to it. The community nursing unit in Birr opened recently having lain idle for two years. I am glad it is finally open now, the staff having been provided to run the beds as promised. However, this goes back to long-term planning. How can we decide we need a unit, provide the money for it and yet leave it lying idle for two years? It is a serious question. People are concerned to see other facilities supposedly coming on stream but <Col N="1424"/>which could be left lying idle. For example, Riada House in Tullamore and Ophalia House in Edenderry, where extensions were promised years ago to provide the needed beds, have not come on stream. This brings one back to the issue of overcrowding within hospitals and the use of beds by people who would perhaps be better cared for elsewhere. The lack of available beds is unfortunately forcing people into private nursing homes at great cost to themselves or their families. The care is not necessarily any less but it is not always the optimum choice for people and many find they cannot afford it. In this context, one must consider the issue of the variation in the cost of subvention.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to describe the position one is in since the abolition of the health boards. People write the same letters to the same people with similar titles and addresses, except that it is the Health Service Executive midlands area rather than the Midland Health Board. I had hoped that the one good aspect of the abolition of the health boards would have been that anomalies between regions would have been addressed and we could have achieved a better, fairer and more equal standard of care throughout the country. However, this has not happened yet. Subvention is a perfect example in this regard.</P>
      <P>I accept that owing to pressures of population, private nursing home care may be more expensive in some parts of the eastern region than others. It might be more expensive in some parts of the eastern region to secure private nursing home care but I cannot understand why enhanced subvention in the eastern region should be up to &euro;520 whereas in the midlands region the rate paid is only between &euro;50 and &euro;90. That is a huge difference of up to &euro;430. It is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The midlands region borders the eastern region and many of the same population pressures affect places such as Portlaoise, Edenderry, Mullingar and even Longford. I do not understand why such a disparity exists. Furthermore, 1,098 people in the eastern region were able to avail of the enhanced subvention whereas only 32 people in the midlands region could avail of it. These matters must be addressed. It is important that the Health Service Executive deals with such anomalies and ensures that people are treated properly and equitably. It certainly is not happening at present.</P>
      <P>Recently, I attended a meeting of an Alzheimer&rsquo;s group in my constituency. The difficulties it faces are no different from those faced by other groups. However, the main points the group raised with me were the cost of care, subventions and the availability of care. Not every nursing home is willing to take in a person suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. They generally require a greater standard of care than other residents of nursing homes. Care is often far more expensive because of the greater care requirements. This must be addressed.</P><Col N="1425"/>
      <P>I believe there is only one bed dedicated to Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients in County Offaly. Compared with the number of people at the meeting who have relatives suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, it is a negligible allocation and has no impact. That is unfair and wrong. Certainly, public community nursing units and nursing homes have a duty to address this. It might be more difficult to force private nursing homes to do it although I would have no difficulty with such a decision being taken. They should not be in the position of picking and choosing the residents they accept. When they have the facilities available they should ensure that everybody is able to avail of them.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of help for carers in their homes. Due to the shortage of spaces, many people are forced to deal with patients and relatives suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in their homes. That imposes huge burdens and involves 24-hour care. There is no way around it due to the nature of the illness. The Government should examine and address this issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy spoke about opposition to charging for public nursing home care. It certainly did not come from this side of the House. We accept the principle that people must pay for care and nobody in Fine Gael has stated otherwise. The Bill provides for an 80% charge across the board. The Minister should consider that different people have different needs. A person who is bedridden in a nursing home might not need the same amount of money by virtue of the fact that he or she is bedridden and might be incapacitated either mentally or physically.</P>
      <P>However, there are others in nursing home care who might be able to go to Mass or to the shops for the newspapers and so forth. This leaves such people with a small amount of disposable income. I am not suggesting a scale but we should examine this provision to ensure that it could be applied in a fairer manner. Everybody, regardless of whether they are in a nursing home, has the right to a quality of life, and a resident of a nursing home has the same desires as other people to buy things, have their hair done and the like. We must ensure that we give them the dignity and quality of life of being able to do that. It is important that this point is made.</P>
      <P>The current Minister for Health and Children has not handled this issue well &mdash; she has handled it badly. There has been little clarity. Legislation was rushed through the House before Christmas, despite warnings from all sides of the House. The end result is as expected. Despite the fact that the Minister was rushing the legislation through the House, she made a tokenistic and patronising gesture of paying everybody &euro;2,000. There is a different figure for everybody in terms of what the care cost, what they paid and how they were illegally charged. The payment of &euro;2,000 across the board was nonsense. The end result is that this matter will cost us a fortune, while dealing with it will be an administrative nightmare. There should be <Col N="1426"/>clear guidelines from the Government on how it intends to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>The doctor-only medical card was a good idea. Deputy Twomey suggested it initially, before the T&aacute;naiste, but as a temporary measure. The means-testing method in the Bill is extremely interesting. There will be another trip to the Supreme Court if the Government is not careful and if the Minister does not accept amendments to it. It is certainly discriminatory and an attack on marriage. That is unusual and a pity. Why should a married couple be treated in a more negative way than a couple who are cohabiting? A married couple will be means tested against the spousal income but that will not happen to a couple who choose to live together and not get married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is trying to put a spin on this Bill. I heard a Minister describe it as a good news Bill but if we consider its background, we will soon find out from where the good news came.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, the two Ministers of State and a secretary of the Department discussed this subject in 2003. Somehow, however, the senior Minister neither heard nor knew what happened. It was obviously troubling the Department and the Minister; they knew they were sitting on a time bomb. After this, the Ombudsman wrote about the issue and the former chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Perry, raised it. It was then raised by the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny. That is what one could call whistleblowing. Had that not taken place, a Bill would not have been rushed through the House before Christmas and we would not be dealing with this Bill today. That explains the origin of the current mess.</P>
      <P>Why are the most vulnerable people in society, people with nothing, asked to carry the can all the time? It would not happen to the higher level professions in this country. Invariably, it happened to people who had nobody to speak for them. A chain of events led to this Bill. It is fortunate that the President acted as she did and that the Supreme Court did what it had to do. Let nobody tell me the Government was the originator of this Bill; it was brought screaming to it.</P>
      <P>I have much to say but, unfortunately, I do not have sufficient time. I believe the Government will be back before the Supreme Court before long, as Deputy Enright mentioned, on the question of eligibility for the medical card. There will be an uprising throughout the country. The Government has decided that a married couple are less likely to get a medical card than a couple who are cohabiting. There will be a remarkable reaction, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>There is another important matter. The Supreme Court found that the people who were affected are entitled to compensation. I sincerely hope they get it. I hope they will not be pushed into the courts but that they will get it by right. The advertisements Deputy Dennehy saw in the <Col N="1427"/>newspaper are a matter of concern. However, at the end of the day, the Government is in office to govern. A serious mistake has been made and insult given to those at the bottom of the ladder in our society. I hope they will be treated with respect and dignity in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The public listening to this debate will not take much notice of the comments of the T&aacute;naiste, who stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I refer to future services for older people specifically. It has been the policy of successive Governments to endeavour to help older people maintain themselves in the community while at the same time providing for residential care which is not prohibitively expensive.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I do not have time to comment on the rest of her contribution. How does this statement square with the situation of an 80 year old man in north Galway who recently had circulation problems in his legs, suffered serious pain and was hospitalised for several weeks? The man and his wife, who is crippled with arthritis, have medical cards. He was told that an appliance, like a big shoe, which would put pressure on the veins to help the circulation of blood in his leg could be hired from a Dublin firm. The man must use this appliance at home for five hours each day. If it was not in his house, he would have to take up a bed in one of the hospitals in Galway. What did the Health Service Executive do? It slapped the man with a bill for &euro;1,550 for a 90 day rental. When 90 days is up, he will have to pay another &euro;1,550.</P>
      <P>It was put to the former health board and the Health Service Executive that this man was helping by not taking up a hospital bed and that he has a better quality of life at home, where he should be, as the T&aacute;naiste stated in the comment referred to above. Moreover, he would be less of a financial drag on the State. I hope the T&aacute;naiste takes notice of this. There is no relationship between her statement referred to above and what is happening in the country. Unless she gets her act together, many will not believe a word the Government says on anything to do with health.</P>
      <P>If we do not treat people, particularly the elderly, with dignity and respect, it will be a mark against society in general. There must be a major input by the Government. These elderly people worked hard, paid their dues and, as such, should be treated with respect and dignity, which many are not.</P>
      <P>I highly commended Deputy Twomey for his courage in openly stating that the doctor-only medical cards were a means to an end, which was not opposition for opposition&rsquo;s sake. He never stated, and neither will I, that this development should finish at the first stage. We sincerely hope that whatever Government is in place in the next couple of years will try to change doctor-only cards to full medical cards to give people that to which they are entitled. However, despite the 30,000 extra cards which were to be issued this year, some 10,000 cards were taken out of the <Col N="1428"/>system last year, which reduces the number of extra cards to 20,000. If my figures are correct, the increase in wages means it is doubtful 20,000 extra cards will be granted despite the 7.5% increase in the eligibility threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn. I welcome this attempt to address the difficulties caused. I recognise the point made by Deputy Connaughton in regard to Deputy Twomey. Opposition for the sake of opposition was not Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s role and I recognise his responsible attitude on this issue. However, it should also be recognised that it is not the Government&rsquo;s role to create difficulties for the elderly. I will not rehash the statistics on increased funding for the elderly in all areas because this has the effect of annoying Members. However, I will not accept condemnation of the Government as being miserly towards the elderly as that is not the case</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to clarify some issues related to it. In recent weeks the impression has been created that the Government is intent on removing supports for the elderly and ensuring that they must pay for all of their care and attention. There is a belief that this care and attention should be free across the board. While I have not heard it suggested in the House, this impression has been created.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have noted major improvements to nursing homes and care centres for the elderly in my constituency. I do not highlight this to justify the difficulties created in recent months and years. I fully accept difficulties exist and that we have a job to redress these. If elderly people are entitled to a refund in full of money taken, I would fully support this. However, it should also be noted that over those years great strides were taken to put in place proper facilities for the elderly. I have visited care centres in my constituency, including at Mountmellick last week, and witnessed the major improvements made. It galls me that people suggest the Government intends to remove entitlements.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for me to address this issue as I may be asked why I do not support the elderly. However, I must recognise the huge costs involved. I was surprised to find that the cost of catering for a patient in my local hospital for the elderly &mdash; I am sure it is the same across the board &mdash; amounts to &euro;1,200 per week. As pensions are approximately &euro;170 per week, the level of care now extended to the elderly could not be considered unless there was an adequate funding base &mdash; I understand the cumulative figure for this is approximately &euro;2 million per week.</P>
      <P>I am delighted supports are in place. This issue does not only concern board and lodging but many aspects across the spectrum. I was delighted to note the advances in services at Mountmellick, Shaen in Portlaoise and Abbeyleix, the centres for care of the elderly in County Laois, and similar advances in County Offaly. A range of services which were not available five years ago <Col N="1429"/>are now in place, properly so. However, they could not have been initiated or continue unless funding was in place. I am glad we have moved away from the ordinary issues of board and lodging. My local hospital, quite properly, contains a wide spectrum of facilities for crafts, art, music, reflexology and relaxation.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>It should not be imagined, though in our minds it unfortunately is, that the only way to care for the elderly is to locate places for them in nursing homes. I take the point made by Deputy Connaughton. I do not see this as a good news package. Why should we see it as such? I see it as focusing on the needs of the elderly. That is not a cop-out by way of admitting that we have been wrong on this issue and now have the opportunity to right it. We should not do so by suggesting that the only way forward is to provide nursing home places. The former health board members among us have regularly made the case for the need to increase subventions in the area, though I recognise that over the past few years, the level of funding in that area has quite properly increased.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>It is also fair to recognise that the age profile of the elderly is ever on the increase and the demands placed on the State by that situation are also increasing, as is the demand for further Exchequer funding. We must debate how we care for our elderly. It has often been said that a state is judged on such care, and I accept that. The most important aspect of this debate must be how we move towards providing funding for the elderly and towards recognising that it is not just a matter of finding health board care centre places for them. The possibilities of further grant aid or tax breaks for nursing homes must be opened up.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate. I greatly regret the pain caused but do not think that handing &euro;2,000 to individuals to make up for times past is just a gimmick. I see it as an honest attempt to recognise that a mistake has been made and to rectify it.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the medical cards initiative. I do not see it as a yellow pack answer, a quick fix or a cheap gimmick. It is clearly focused on bringing a further 200,000 people into the net. From talking to GPs in my area I am satisfied that a certain barrier has been removed in the case of families, particularly where asthma is a problem, who are often reluctant, especially if there are two, three or maybe four people in the family, to attend their local GP. The initiative has been worthwhile. I take the point that there are fewer people on medical cards than there were. I do not want to throw in a red herring but surely that is related to the fact that we have a growing economy with more people at work, so clearly there are more people outside the previous medical card net.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative. I do not see it as an attempt to downgrade the elderly. It is a way of focusing on how we can further support them. I thank the T&aacute;naiste for recognising that. On the day of her press conference I thought it was a bold initiative on her behalf to recognise that <Col N="1430"/>while we could not immediately extend the medical card numbers, this action could be taken. I believe the initiative showed great promise. Goodwill has been shown towards it and I too welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health (Amendment) Bill for a number of reasons. It is important to focus our attention on looking after elderly people within our communities and on low income families who found it so difficult to avail of GP services over recent years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legal framework set out in the Bill for charging patients for the maintenance element of inpatient services in publicly funded long-term care residential units. After 29 years, it is important that this be put on a sound legal basis. From speaking over the past few weeks to people in the community and those working for the former Western Health Board in my area, now the Health Service Executive, I know that people find it incredible that a situation like this could have been allowed to develop over the terms of successive Governments for 29 years.</P>
      <P>The number of written and telephone inquiries to the Health Service Executive on this issue has been unprecedented and it is clear from public debate on the radio that people have been unable to get through to the helpline. Calls to my constituency office show that this issue will be a major one and an administrative nightmare over the next few months but in the end, people have a sound legal basis for their claims. I welcome the statement by the T&aacute;naiste that this matter will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding nursing homes and people being looked after in the community, people recognise that nursing homes provide a valuable service. The contributions of people towards the cost of this service represent a small percentage of the overall cost so it is important that it is put on a sound legal footing.</P>
      <P>The matter gives me an opportunity to raise an issue in the programme for Government which affects my constituency, namely, providing for elderly people in their own community. Coming from Mayo as I do, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the claim on behalf of the people of the Ballinrobe area who have been seeking a nursing home in the town for over 25 years. I was chairperson of the Western Health Board in 1999 and the board purchased a site for the purpose just before 2002, for &pound;300,000. Unfortunately we are still waiting. It was not included in the national development plan for capital projects in the Western Health Board area. We were awaiting funding from the Department of Health and Children to honour a commitment given by the parties in government that they would provide for community nursing in the areas where the elderly people are. I hope that a nursing home in Ballinrobe will be considered a high priority by the Government in the near future because the com<Col N="1431"/>munity there has worked very hard in achieving its objective.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>When the T&aacute;naiste came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children a number of weeks ago, I raised the issue of the level of subventions paid in different parts of the country. It is completely discriminatory that within the former Western Health Board area a person can get a subvention only up to a maximum of &euro;220 weekly, while someone living in Dublin or in the eastern part of the country can get up to &euro;500 or &euro;600 weekly. That is unacceptable. Looking at the costs involved, even for example the cost of providing a nurse on the east coast <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the west, there is no massive discrepancy involved. It is unfair to expect nursing home owners in the west to provide an essential service when they are treated unfairly.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on the fact that she acknowledged to the committee that this was discriminatory. Indeed the situation is worse in the east where one could have a nursing home on one side of the road getting a &euro;300 subvention per client while one on the other side of the road gets &euro;600 per client. That needs to be addressed and I ask the Minister to look at it in the near future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Supreme Court decision that it was unsound that retrospective provisions would be put into a Bill making lawful the imposition and payment of charges for something that occurred in the past. That is welcome because it would have set an unfortunate precedent. One would have to call into question the legal advice given when the Bill was brought to the House before Christmas. It is important that we take our time with legislation that is vitally important to all citizens. We now have to deal with the position in which we find ourselves. It is important to move forward, to recognise the excellent work being done by the State and by private nursing homes in our community and to put them on a sound footing in the future.</P>
      <P>The other significant issue this Bill deals with is the doctor-only medical cards. I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that within the former Western Health Board area, particularly in my county, we had the biggest decrease in medical cards in the country from the period 1997 to October 2004. In County Mayo during that period, 8,319 people lost their medical cards. I put a number of parliamentary questions to the T&aacute;naiste at the time noting that income levels in County Mayo have not increased sufficiently to sustain that level of decrease in the number of medical cards. The programme for Government states that medical card eligibility would be extended in line with the recommendations of the national health strategy. How may that tally with a reduction of 8,300 cards in County Mayo? I welcome the 7.5% increase in the income threshold, which will result in the provision of 30,000 additional medical cards. I also welcome the provision of 200,000 doctor only medical cards. When the annual review of medical cards is car<Col N="1432"/>ried out next year, I hope there will not have been another significant reduction in the number of traditional card holders in County Mayo and that there will be an increase in doctor only cards. I hope doctor only cards will not be a substitute for traditional medical cards because the value of such cards to families is significant. I welcome the provision of the doctor only cards, as they will enable many low income families to avail of GP services. Many of them have avoided bringing children to their GPs and, unfortunately, the consequences have been serious. I hope we will not witness the demise of the traditional medical card through its substitution by the doctor only card.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, an individual can attend a variety of doctors. Will the Minister of State explain how that will work? I tabled a parliamentary question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children seeking reasons for the loss of 8,300 medical cards in County Mayo and she replied that 8,047 cards were lost because the holders had died. A total of only 253 people, therefore, lost their medical cards on the basis of income. In addition, the doctors involved were paid as if the medical cards were still in use, even though the holders were deceased. That money will be recouped over time but it was a serious waste given that the money could well have been used to provide medical cards for people in need. The figures must be analysed and money paid on foot of a card held by a deceased person should be refunded.</P>
      <P>The post polio group appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children recently. A finite number of people are affected by this illness, which they want covered under the long-term illness scheme. Unfortunately, the Department has not extended cover to illnesses under this scheme in recent years. I ask the Minister of State to consider adding this illness, as it affects a finite number of people who have suffered greatly. Their needs are quantifiable and while, in a number of cases, they are being looked on sympathetically by the Health Service Executive through the discretionary arrangement available to chief officers, unfortunately, the discretion is not applied consistently throughout the State, resulting in discrimination between HSE areas. When I sought the issuing of guidelines to chief officers regarding the use of discretion, I was informed that if guidelines were put in place, the discretion would be removed. However, there is discrimination between various HSE areas and the Department could easily solve this problem if it was willing.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the legislation, it is unnecessary. If more time had been put into planning and drafting the original legislation before it was introduced in the House in December, we would not have to debate the issue again.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to re-examine the position of Ballinrobe nursing home. The community has campaigned for 25 years because there is a serious need in the area. Both Govern<Col N="1433"/>ment parties reiterated their commitment to the area in the programme for Government and it should be forthcoming. I look forward to a positive response in this regard in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Lynch. The Bill will amend the Health Act 1970 to address two matters &mdash; the charging of patients for maintenance and inpatient services in residential hospitals and the introduction of doctor only medical cards. The issue of who is entitled to be refunded as a result of illegal charges in community hospitals where contract beds were provided is clear but many elderly people were told they had to take beds in private nursing homes because no beds were available in community hospitals. One can imagine the trauma experienced by elderly people who knew their own families were involved in debating with the liaison officer at the time. They accepted the transfer because they had no choice. They were given application forms, which were all but signed for them in many cases. They had no choice but to accept a private nursing home. Over the years the Government provided private nursing homes and provided substantial tax breaks to private enterprise to build them but the Government did not consider nursing home subvention payments. The families of elderly people transferred them to private nursing homes but did not realise the subvention payments were much less than the weekly cost of care in the homes. In some cases elderly people were forced to sell their homes to pay the charges. Most people I know from rural areas in my constituency had to sell their cottages, even though they were entitled to full subvention because of their medical needs.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party does not object to charging elderly people through deductions from their pensions but we are seeking justice and fairness for everybody. I followed this issue closely as a former member of the Southern Health Board. The former Ombudsman stated that under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 an elderly person in need is entitled to inpatient accommodation in a public or private nursing home. I hope the Minister of State will address this issue when he replies. Will people who were resident in private nursing homes receive refunds? It is staggering to consider that the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, spent &euro;30 million on consultant reports but continually ignored the issue of nursing home charges.</P>
      <P>I refer to the provision of doctor only medical cards. The saddest aspect of the nursing home scandal is that medical cards provide good value for money, speedy access to GPs and can reduce the cost of prescription drugs and hospital charges for individuals and families on low incomes. A few years ago 39% of the population had medical cards. I remember approximately eight years ago it was 49%. I understand that it is now 27%, and that gives one an idea of what has been happening. Many people who find themselves marginally over the limit are refused a <Col N="1434"/>medical card and are offered doctor-only cards instead. The Minister says this allows a patient to avail of a doctor&rsquo;s services for free and to claim back the cost of drugs in excess of &euro;85 a month. I am well aware that there are people who do not have a medical card who visit doctors and do not go to the chemist because they cannot afford the drugs. They are marginally over the limit. In my region there is a community welfare officer, a superintendent community welfare officer and a referee. There was a time some years ago when one person would do all that in his or her own time. It might have taken a little longer but that person knew what was happening. They did not have the problems we do now.</P>
      <P>In 2001 we were told that every person over 70, irrespective of wealth, was to have a medical card. That the cost of the scheme was underestimated is a further example of the maladministration of this Government. I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Dennehy, speak at length on the subject, but he did not know what he was talking about. I would give the following example. A person refused a medical card because of being marginally over the limit went into a chemist despite the fear that it would be impossible to pay. Beside that person was a farmer with three farms and one of the wealthiest people in the locality. He presented his medical card to the chemist while the other person could not afford what was prescribed. That is not an exaggeration, and that is the issue. A means test should have been carried out to determine whether the person was entitled to a medical card. For people on fixed incomes, it is simply not possible to pay prescription charges even though general practitioner charges are covered by these new cards. The scheme does not work for those on a low income.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister will address these questions when replying. I have said over the years, especially during health board meetings, that the way the most vulnerable elderly people have been treated in terms of health services is appalling. The current Health Service Executive is not inspiring confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This is probably the longest debate that we have had on the care of the elderly and how we are to treat them in future that I can remember having taken place in the D&aacute;il. That is an indictment when one considers that all the statistics tell us that we have an aging population. That may have changed slightly in the last five or six years, but the bulk of our population will soon be heading into the elderly bracket. Despite this, the only occasion that we take time to debate this issue is when we put right a grievous wrong perpetrated over almost 30 years. That is an indictment of the Government.</P>
      <P>There are several matters regarding this issue that we must discuss. For instance, not one of three Ministers came away from a meeting they all attended questioning the legality of what was taking place. Not one of them has been held to account either. The former senior Minister in the <Col N="1435"/>Department of Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has walked away from the issue in such a way that one could almost swear that he had never had anything to do with health. He has left a minefield in his wake. The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was right when he said that he felt that the Department of Health and Children was like Angola. The current Minister for Health and Children, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, must surely feel that way given what she has been landed with.</P>
      <P>No one can walk away from the blame. It was clearly an issue that was known. The Ministers attended that meeting, yet none of them has said in the House that the matter was raised or spelt out or if it was clear or unclear. We do not know, but the meeting was clearly called to discuss something and was ignored because it was near the time of a general election and the Government cares about nothing other than winning such elections. It will sacrifice everything else as long as it wins the election.</P>
      <P>We in this House are discussing for the first time how we treat the elderly. Each of us at our advice centres receives calls every day from daughters, husbands, wives and sisters about an elderly relative who needs full-time care and attention that is not available. I remember, eight or nine years ago, listening to Deputy Sherlock talking about this very issue and that it was illegal to charge elderly people who were in the care of the State and had full eligibility. I am not simply saying that today; I have been saying it for a long time. I remember Deputy Sherlock raising the issue on the Southern Health Board and his being ignored. He and others knew it, but the matter was not to be discussed because no one wanted to deal with it.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>Up to last year there were terms in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> such as &ldquo;bed blockers&rdquo;. The reason there was such a crisis in accident and emergency departments is that we had bed blockers. In the main they were elderly people too sick to go home and with nowhere else to go. The geriatrician in the Southern Health Board region had declared that they were in need of full-time care and attention &mdash; the same geriatrician who was on the team that produced the Hanly report. He was very well thought of and clearly an expert in his field. He assessed elderly people and said that they could not go home since they were in need of full-time care and attention. However, none was available from the State. Just as Deputy Sherlock has said, they were handed the subvention forms and told to apply. On top of that, they were given a list of nursing homes and told where beds were available. That is still happening. It is not past history because it occurs today. That is how we still treat the elderly. Exactly that happened to someone today in hospital after an assessment.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>When it first arose, being recommended for a subvention of any kind took up to two months. Enhanced subvention at health board level is now <Col N="1436"/>taking up to 12 months because the funding has been cut back. We now know who is to be refunded, but to suggest at this late stage that it will be &euro;2,000 per family or per person is premature. We do not know how much it will cost, and people have rights in that respect too. To try out the figure of &euro;2,000, as was provided in the legislation before Christmas, is premature, and the Minister needs some advice on that. That is not how it will pan out. However, those really put to the pin of their collars were those who had to enter private nursing homes that cost &euro;600 or &euro;700 per week and whose families had to try to scrape together what they could. The entire network of family is being put under tremendous pressure to pay it and it continues to happen. We are not talking about history; this is happening now.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We are not putting enough money towards providing places for the elderly. A Government backbencher spoke earlier about the marvellous strides we have made. We have made strides but from a very low base and there is much more to be done. Was that not the slogan during the election &mdash; much done, more to do?</P>

	<P>There is much more to do.</P>

	<P>And we are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case, but that is a debate for another day. When it comes to the elderly we should have debates like this regularly. We should not try with sleight of hand to put right what we did wrong in the past. That must not happen. We must take responsibility for the elderly. The two greatest needs in society now are child care and services for the elderly.</P>
      <P>The issue of institutional abuse arose on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with Joe Duffy today. The next major inquiry into the way the State treated people or ignored their needs will be about the care of the elderly. We will be sitting at home or in a home one day and remembering when this issue first arose and that we should have taken much more interest in it at the time. The next major scandal that will break will be the way we have treated the elderly, and we had better start doing something about it while we have the money. The rest of the world has done it and I do not understand why we cannot do the same.</P>
      <P>On the medical card element of the Bill, and I am glad Deputy Cooper-Flynn raised the issue, these cards will be more than welcome to families who have lost their medical cards because they went over the income limit. I am talking about people with young children or those who have a teenager suffering from asthma, which is not a long-term illness and does not carry the same entitlement to a medical card.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Cooper-Flynn, I have a sneaking suspicion that we are not adding to the medical <Col N="1437"/>card scheme but dismantling it. We are seeing the first step towards the replacement of the medical card which provides access to doctors&rsquo; services and medication. More of these cards will probably be issued next year and at the same time we will see a decrease in the number of full medical cards issued. Only a Progressive Democrats Minister could introduce a scheme such as this. While I feel sorry for the T&aacute;naiste in terms of what the former Minister, Deputy Martin, left behind him in the Department of Health and Children, I will have no sympathy for her if that is her intention, which I believe it is.</P>
      <P>This measure is much more sinister. We are beginning to see a dismantling of the medical card scheme that has served this country well. As Deputy Sherlock rightly said, the percentages have dropped dramatically. Fewer medical cards are issued in every county than was the case in 1997. That is happening; it is not a gimmick. It is a planned initiative to dismantle the medical card scheme and no better Minister to do that than a Progressive Democrats Minister.</P>
      <P>This short but significant Bill is no more than the first step in a debate which must take place on the manner in which we care for the elderly. There is one element of it which really annoys me &mdash; the notion that elderly men and women would be left with &euro;30 in their pockets each week as if they were children. One&rsquo;s needs do not diminish as one gets older. If anything, they increase. As a woman I know that women only realised in recent years that the dignity that comes with financial independence cannot be replaced. Even if people are well cared for, they still want to be able to put their hands in their pockets and pay for their little comforts. For someone to be left with &euro;30 at the end of their years is a scandal. In replying, perhaps the Minister would indicate whether this measure represents a dismantling of the medical card scheme and explain what happened at that meeting. When will we hear about that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important and topical Bill. It is important and topical because of the immediate impact it will have on the lives of many people. There are two aspects to the Bill and I would like to deal first with the section on long-term stay.</P>
      <P>Every Member of the House will be aware of the decision of the Supreme Court regarding the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004, which was passed by this House just before Christmas. While most media attention has focused on the findings of the Supreme Court that retrospective charges are unconstitutional, another finding by the court which received much less coverage is that the practice of asking patients in long-term stay insti<Col N="1438"/>tutions to contribute something to the cost of their bed and maintenance is constitutional.</P>
      <P>This practice has existed for many years but the underlying legislation has been defective. Why the practice was allowed to continue in the light of such defective legislation is an important issue, and I welcome the speed with which the T&aacute;naiste has moved to clarify this point. The report by Mr. Travers into this point will be published in the next few days and we will then be able to ascertain the reason this unsatisfactory position was allowed to continue for so long.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that this situation has existed for 30 years under 11 Governments of all political hues and nearly every party in this House was in Government at some stage during those 30 years. This report will clarify the reason that position existed. The openness of the Minister for Health and Children and the speed at which she has moved has displayed a welcome example of transparency.</P>
      <P>It can never be correct to charge people for a service when the basis for that charge is defective in law. To do so to a group of people who are among the most vulnerable in society &mdash; the elderly and, in many cases, the infirm &mdash; is wrong and must not be allowed to occur again. Any such charges were deducted from the old age pension. That was, in many if not all cases, the only source of income for those elderly people. For many of the years during which the practice continued, the old age pension was at a derisory level and it was only in 1997, when the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government came to power, that the old age pension started to attain a reasonable level.</P>
      <P>The result of all of this is that many elderly people had no disposable income to spend on the essentials we all need such as toiletries, clothes etc. I know from attending long-term stay residences that the quality of their lives would have been intolerable had it not been for the generosity of their families and friends who spent their own money to give some dignity to their elderly relatives and neighbours. It is easy to forget today, when the old age pension is approximately &euro;166 per week, how much more difficult it was to survive on a pension of £30 or £40 per week. I understand some health boards were in the habit of taking all the pension entitlements of people who were in long-stay accommodation. I welcome the speed at which the Government, in particular the Minister, moved to stop deductions as soon as it became apparent that there was a legal difficulty with these charges.</P>
      <P>I ask that the Health Service Executive increase the number of people manning the information hotline, advertised in today&rsquo;s newspapers, because many of my constituents in Sligo-Leitrim are experiencing difficulties in obtaining information on the repayment scheme. There is a great deal of confusion among members of the public regarding when and how repayments will be made. The sooner this confusion is cleared up <Col N="1439"/>the better. The Supreme Court ruled that such charges are illegal under the existing legislation, and the sooner such moneys are repaid the better.</P>
      <P>I wish now to deal with the second aspect of the Bill, namely, the introduction of doctor-only medical cards. As I stated on many occasions, despite the widespread and welcome growth in our economy in recent years, there are still people who find it increasingly difficult to access medical services, particularly those at primary or general practitioner level. This is especially true of those whose incomes just exceed the threshold relating to medical card qualification. In many instances, these people have families with three or four children. In the normal course of events, children succumb to the usual childhood illnesses such as upper respiratory tract infections. In many cases, these illnesses are self-limiting. Occasionally, however, they may progress to become more serious illnesses such as pneumonia.</P>
      <P>I am aware of instances where parents delayed attending their GP in the hope that the ailment affecting their child might be self-limiting. Unfortunately, this has sometimes had disastrous consequences leading to patients requiring urgent admission to hospital. Cases such as those to which I refer came about purely as a result of patients&rsquo; parents being unable to afford the cost of a visit to the doctor and not through any negligence on their part.</P>
      <P>Inability to access medical care should not be allowed in any society. It is an affront to all standards of decency. I and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il have agitated for some time for an extension of the general medical service to cover an increased number of people. Some weeks before the recent budget, a formal motion I proposed was unanimously adopted at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party. I was delighted when the Minister for Finance announced the provision of the additional 200,000 medical cards on budget day.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides the legislative basis for these welcome medical cards. Some members of the Opposition have tried to deride these cards. I have no doubt that the people who will benefit from the cards do not share that viewpoint because they will enable them to avail of medical care when they might otherwise, for the reasons outlined, be reluctant to do so. I understand that the additional funding of &euro;60 million being provided in the current year will allow for approximately 200,000 of these cards to be issued and that it is the intention of the HSE to set the income threshold relating to the cards at approximately 25% above the existing level. These cards should be available next month. I urge the Health Service Executive to process applications for them as soon as possible. Any person who is just outside the current financial limit and who believes that he or she will come within the 25% range should apply immediately.</P><Col N="1440"/>
      <P>I commend this important and timely Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Little did any of us think we would be welcoming legislation of this nature so early in the new year. There is much reason to welcome the Bill. However, the fact that this is happening so soon after the introduction of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 must make us aware of the dangers of bringing forward hasty legislation. I do not believe anyone on this side of the House was not aware of the difficulties of bringing forward such legislation in an attempt to save the State some money. The previous Bill was brought forward on good advice from the Attorney General, and a Minister can only act on such advice. The President, in her wisdom, saw fit to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. We must be grateful to her for that because it has been determined that the previous Bill was unconstitutional. It is our job now to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides legal certainty in respect of charges. I do not believe the House is divided on the question of charges. Everybody recognises that the State is not in a position to provide total care free of cost. With one or two exceptions, no one in the House is seeking that the State make such provision.</P>
      <P>We must thank the T&aacute;naiste for her swift action in terms of dealing with this issue. It has been stated that people knew the position regarding charges for over 20 years. True to form, the T&aacute;naiste was prepared to do something swiftly about it. The only criticism one could level at her is that she moved hastily but, as stated, there were good reasons for her doing so.</P>
      <P>With the Bill before us, we are now in a position to deal with the legal certainty of providing for the imposition of charges. The House is not really divided on that matter. However, this is an area in respect of which we must act responsibly. Demographics indicate that the population is getting older and we must consider how we will provide for care of the elderly. The latter is particularly relevant because we will all grow old in the not too distant future and we would like to believe that there will be adequate services available to us. One of the Government&rsquo;s priorities is to put in place a proper and sustainable care programme for the elderly.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer now to the difficulties that arise when dealing with the monolith that is the Department of Health and Children. The Department must be reorganised and streamlined in order that the money goes to the patient and not necessarily be spent on infrastructure or bureaucracy. I accept that beds and buildings must be provided. Where these are in existence, however, they must be opened and operated in a cost-effective way. In the area I represent, beds are available at the Blackrock Hospice and Leopardstown. I would like the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that these beds are opened to elderly <Col N="1441"/>members of the population in the area I represent, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, who need them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill relating to GP-only medical cards. When one is in a position of responsibility, as is the case with all governments, one must set priorities. The Government cannot sign blank cheques to be used for the provision of services. Of course we would like to provide optimum services for every patient but that is not feasible. When the T&aacute;naiste recognised that parents frequently did not go to their doctors, either in respect of themselves or their children, because they could not afford to do so, she determined to provide them with the reassurance of access to free visits. We had been faced with an either-or situation, namely, should we provide more full medical cards to a smaller population or provide the security offered by free GP-only medical cards? The Government has wisely chosen the latter route. Even Deputy Twomey knows these cards are a good idea and I am sure he will support them, particularly as they represent an effective use of the resources available.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Supreme Court decision, resources will be ever more stretched. We need to ensure, therefore, that resources for patients are provided in the most appropriate way. The IMO has welcomed GP-only cards and the Health Service Executive is about to enter into discussions in respect of them because of anxieties relating to administration of the scheme. However, I am sure the latter will not delay the introduction of the cards. We all know a GP&rsquo;s priorities are for the patient and swift intervention so that any anxieties are allayed or that the required treatment may be undertaken as soon as possible. That will not be much of a barrier because when both parties to any negotiations have the same objective in hand, there is no reason consensus may not be delivered quickly.</P>
      <P>The question of legal certainty for the future is another matter that is welcome. It was something that needed to be addressed and the Minister has courageously decided to do this promptly. That it is being done through legislation dealing with medical cards is significant as well. I suppose a type of belt-and-braces approach is being taken in that it is not being done by means of a statutory instrument so that we will not find ourselves in the current position in future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill. I hope it has a swift passage through legislation. I hope people who deserve whatever recompense they are entitled to because they had their contributions taken from them, illegally as it now transpires, avail of the service. It is the least the State can do to provide a more transparent service for people while making a charge for what is a very good care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Cowley. I do not wish to talk about the introduction of the doctor-only medical card under this proposed legislation. My colleague, Deputy <Col N="1442"/>Gormley and other members of the Green Party have spoken and will speak on it. I broadly welcome it, although I share some of the reservations already expressed.</P>
      <P>I want to use this opportunity to outline my absolute disgust, which is probably too weak a phrase, for this legislation. Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley has just left the Chamber. She praised the T&aacute;naiste for her clarity and foresight in identifying this little glitch whereby taking money from the elderly for services they had already paid for over the years through graft and taxation was illegal. The T&aacute;naiste brought the matter to public attention. However, it is an even greater sin, having known that it was illegal and morally unjustifiable, to proceed with it and try to legalise this robbery.</P>
      <P>I could not help thinking of the analogy with Robin Hood and his merry men. There were many merry men in the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenches, but in this context this Administration and previous Governments are &ldquo;Robbing Hoods&rdquo;. The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, is the sheriff of Newcastle who, having collected the taxes from the local villages, proceeds to legalise the law that says, in effect, that they can be plundered and the money taken off them again. I believe my parents, grandparents and great-grandparents who contributed to this society over the years deserve better.</P>
      <P>This is a timely opportunity to outline the sort of policy we have towards the elderly for the future. Older people lived through the Emergency or the Second World War. They saw the first boom in the 1960s, the oil crises of the 1970s, the recession of the 1980s and the emergence of the Celtic tiger in the 1990s. They, more than any other segment of society, contributed to this. They are the people who paid tax at 48% during the dark days. It is they who contributed to the economic miracle which is world renowned but which has not done much for people&rsquo;s quality of life. The people who contributed to this have paid with their blood, sweat and tears, from the mothers who reared children or worked outside the home to the fathers who minded their children and who paid taxes at 48%. In this context I am also talking about people who emigrated and sent money home to keep the local economy going, and who are not treated with as much disdain as they reach the twilight of their years. I am thinking in particular of the emigrants in London, but that is for a later debate. I want to confine myself to the elderly in Ireland seeking care who are being treated with contempt.</P>
      <P>People who have already paid in spades through the taxation system should not be asked to pay a large proportion of their pension for residential care. It is what Deputy Joe Higgins would describe as an unfair double taxation. I believe that giving someone the best part of &euro;30 in pocket money is an insult to his or her dignity. Teenagers these days earn more than this in one night working in a pub or in McDonald&rsquo;s. It is a joke and an <Col N="1443"/>affront to a person&rsquo;s human rights and dignity. Fianna F&aacute;il might be complacent in thinking the majority of voters over 60 vote for it or its Thatcherite spawn, the Progressive Democrats. Looking at how society is developing, however, it is the older generation in particular which believes that quality of life is diminishing. They are coming to realise that what Fianna F&aacute;il Governments have given them over the last 30 years is not what it appears to be. I would not be so smug at the next general election in thinking that the elderly will take this ignoble insult on the chin and continue to vote for this Government. I certainly hope they do not.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few suggestions about how quality of life may be improved for the elderly. The Progressive Democrats seem to think that if a person is incapacitated and has no economic merit, he or she is dross and should wait to have life terminated or wither away. I have news for the T&aacute;naiste. The majority of older people are active and contribute to life and society. They should be provided with better opportunities to do this and there are ways and means.</P>
      <P>Although I am a Catholic, I disagree with Pope John Paul II on a number of moral issues. However, here is a shining example of a person of advanced years who has made a unique contribution to society. Let us listen to some of his words. He said the elderly should not be allowed to think of themselves as a burden on the community and sometimes even on their families. He also said they represent a resource to be valued. This beacon for millions of Catholics said as much in his Lenten homily this year. It is a message the Pope can convey, even in his ill-health. I hope the Government takes his words into account.</P>
      <P>Age Action Ireland has made a number of proposals in terms of what may be done to help elderly people. They can get financial aid in residential care and if that means abolishing this measly tax, this is fair enough because while it is only 10% of the overall cost of care, it is a much larger proportional share of an older person&rsquo;s income. Services could be provided to older people in rural areas. That means keeping post offices open and the social fabric alive. It means allowing proper public transport systems to be set up so that the elderly may network and get out and meet people.</P>
      <P>It is a very ageist attitude but many people think that older people are just waiting to wither away and die. When a person finishes active contribution in terms of work, he or she is often seen as not having anything to do. Dr. Garret FitzGerald made a proposal which should be considered, even though I have no opinion on it one way or the other at the moment. He proposed raising the retirement age to 70, which would also have a beneficial economic impact. All the studies have shown that for a person to be kept active in his or her older years by contributing to and being valued in society has positive health and <Col N="1444"/>economic benefits. Community employment schemes have a contribution to make in this regard, and not just for training which was their original purpose. Older people can make a contribution through part-time work as part of community employment schemes, through job sharing etc. These are ways through which older people, who are a major resource as Pope John Paul II has said, may continue to contribute and be valued and cherished.</P>
      <P>Reports have shown that proper nutrition and proper exercise such as weight training and yoga represent the way to ensure that health care costs are kept to a minimum. The Heidelberg guidelines, as proposed by the World Health Organisation, suggested that there are ways and means of promoting physical activity among older people. An independent older person is a happy, vibrant person. We should not aim just to treat people who are sick, but to ensure that fewer elderly people are sick. People are living longer and they should be able to live healthy lives. Anything that is done to promote a healthy, active life should be considered and it would also save the State some money. Education courses are another way forward because keeping someone&rsquo;s mind active is another way of saving the State money.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to think about planning before the demographic time bomb explodes. It should think about providing homes for elderly people mixed in with homes for younger people. Due to the high price of housing in the greater Dublin area, people have moved to Meath and Kildare. Their parents live in the city centre and suburbs, but they cannot spend time with their parents as their time is spent commuting. If we want to build a real sense of community, we have to give incentives to elderly people so that they can live near their families, or to families so that they can afford a house in the area in which they grew up. That sense of community will also save the State money because rather than paying large amounts in cr&egrave;che fees, the elderly member of the family can perform some of the child care duties. That has a cost saving and is a way of valuing older people. Rather than looking at it as a cost and a burden by trying to take 10% of the total cost of care, we should consider giving pensioners their dignity and rights and consider ways of saving the State money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is a fiasco and is 29 years too late. Serious questions need to be asked on how we arrived at this situation. There should surely be some mechanism in this State to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen. We have already had the situation regarding medical cards for persons over 70, where the Department of Health and Children did not know how many people were over 70. That scheme cost many more millions of euro than was ever anticipated. In the course of time, memos from the Department will tell their own story, but I wonder will the report that we are to receive tell the full story.</P><Col N="1445"/>
      <P>The Minister has spoken about systemic maladministration in her Department, which shows how she feels about it. I do not think that anybody is blameless here. The entire fiasco does not augur well for the organs of the State and it cries out for reform. I do not begrudge anyone the repayment from the scheme to be set up. It is estimated that &euro;6,000 will be paid for each year that someone spent in public care. However, I fear that relatives who had very little to do with older people will do well out of this. There will certainly be people who will have passed away and on whom little or no records will have been kept. There will, therefore, be money that will go unclaimed. The dormant accounts fund might be considered as a source of money which could be made available where it was impossible to repay it to the people concerned. This has been a great victory for the property rights of older people.</P>
      <P>There are many things that could be done with such a fund. For example, we have no social workers for the elderly in many of our health boards. Older people must try to find the wherewithal to go to medical clinics which they are obliged to attend. They are unable to go because of lack of funds from the Government. There has been a campaign running for a home for elderly people in south Mayo since 1971. Just &euro;400,000 would bring this project to design stage. I met the Minister of State, Deputy Power, with the people of Ballinrobe to discuss this. An assessment of need was done and it was designated a priority. It would certainly do wonders for the trolley count in Galway and Castlebar.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider guidelines on how this money can be distributed. Guidelines must also be drawn up for staff in institutions. When they see relatives arriving like flies to a honey pot, they need to know what to do, what to say and how to say it. There is great room for the exploitation of elderly people so the Minister should set guidelines to address this issue. An old colleague of mine, who has since passed away, used to say that where there is a will, there is a relative. That will be the case in this instance more than ever. Elderly people need someone to represent them. When they cannot have a guardian or a ward of court, they need some advocacy system.</P>
      <P>I am calling for an advocacy system similar to that proposed under the Disability Bill. A group such as Comhairle should be set up under this Bill to act as an advocate for older people. Where people can afford it, a small amount should be deducted for maintenance. However, it would be much better if the amount deducted from the pension left more to the older person so that they could keep body and bone together. For example, 70% should be deducted, rather than the proposed 80%.</P>
      <P>Does this Bill represent the beginning of the process where doctor-only medical cards end up becoming the only medical cards? This is not what was promised. We were promised 200,000 <Col N="1446"/>medical cards, but now we have 200,000 doctor only medical cards. I welcome the fact that the parents of children will be allowed to continue to get treatment without having to reapply, but this will only apply to a small number of children with very serious illness, according to the Minister. The Minister can surely do better than this. I ask him to look at this measure again and extend it to children suffering from any illness.</P>
      <P>Pharmacists have been saying that the new doctor-only medical cards will create great confusion. There is a suggestion that some letter be put on the prescription so that when someone presents at a pharmacy looking for a GMS prescription, the pharmacist will understand that this is a doctor-only medical card. Confusion arising in this regard might represent a roundabout way of introducing a prescription charge. There is a great need for fair play. What has been happening speaks volumes on how we treat our older people.</P>
      <P>There has been a diminution in the number of beds in institutions for elderly people. In my area, we are down about 100 beds in the past few years. People have been forced into the more expensive, profit-driven, non-community nursing home sector. This is not a criticism of nursing homes, where the staff are doing a good job in the absence of a community alternative. People should have the opportunity to stay in their own area. It is not acceptable that beds are taken out of the system and not replaced. The Minister should give serious consideration to breaking down the barriers that prevent communities from looking after their old people. I have yet to meet someone who wanted to leave his or her own area. Nobody wants to leave his or her own area and be part of the sad, silent migration of older people to institutions, where they lose heart and die like the old Indian.</P>
      <P>I have considerable experience in this area and our older people can be maintained at home for a longer period if they have the necessary supports to stay at home. Such supports include proper home help provision and appliances, neither of which has always been available. When a person can no longer be maintained at home, the least they should expect is to be maintained in their community. While it may be second best, it is certainly an option people should have. Services provided through facilities like St. Brendan&rsquo;s village in Mulranny include low, medium and high support at home together with day centre support. The service guarantees that no matter how old or disabled a person is, he or she can remain in the local area. It is what we would all like to do.</P>
      <P>We must ensure the continuation of the trend to reduce the numbers in institutional care in State facilities. With the increase in the number of private nursing homes comes the need to ensure the provision of a community alternative. An alternative can never be provided in the absence of proper support. Communities have <Col N="1447"/>been involved in providing sheltered housing which successfully caters to people who do not have great needs. People with greater needs who can forget to turn the heating on and the cooker off pose a danger to themselves when they are on their own. While sheltered housing and alarms allow them to be maintained in the community for longer, when they can no longer look after themselves they must enter a nursing home. If it is a strange place, they will not do well there. Communities should be involved in the provision of high-support facilities.</P>
      <P>It is possible to support older people in the community. Low-support facilities require a defined funding scheme to meet people&rsquo;s needs. The necessary high support facilities require capital funding as well as a revenue stream. These can only be provided if the Government has the will to replace lip-service to community care with the resources to make it a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be able make a brief contribution on the Bill, the purpose of which is twofold. It seeks to provide a framework to charge patients for the maintenance element of inpatient services and publicly funded long-term care residential units and to facilitate the introduction of general practitioner medical cards. Since I entered the House, I have pursued the introduction of something which is more than a medical card. Rightly or wrongly, medical cards have become more than a way for a person to see a doctor and obtain medicine. They are associated with everything in the system, including free examinations in schools. People often direct at public representatives comments to the effect that they cannot take up work because they will lose their medical cards if they do. The medical card has so many implications beyond health that there is a need to create more tiers in the provision of available services.</P>
      <P>If I were Minister, I would consider creating cards for services at stages between doctor visits and the entitlements of a full medical card. For example, a person with an income exceeding the threshold by a certain amount should receive ten free doctor visits and ten free prescriptions per year. At another income level, a person should receive five free visits and five free prescriptions. While there will always be people who fall outside whatever categories are established, an approach like the one outlined would greatly advantage those who are not regular visitors to their doctor but would find some provision valuable. I would like to think that the proposed general practitioner cards represent an initial point on a journey to a different form of provision. I noted in the Minister&rsquo;s speech a reference to a review of the system after a certain period to ascertain its operation for the 200,000 card holders. As no Member would describe the medical card income limits as generous, the 25% increase represents a necessary starting point. Many <Col N="1448"/>people have great needs which relate not only to health but to associated factors.</P>
      <P>Visiting a doctor should be as much about prevention as treating illness. I was astonished to discover at a recent briefing in Buswells Hotel at which the Irish Cancer Society informed Members about cervical smears that medical cards do not cover prevention. It is an issue which needs to be examined. It is much cheaper to intervene early to stop something from happening than it is to treat it afterwards. At the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, of which I am Chairman, we discuss the issue of obesity. If one addresses such matters early, one will not have to spend significant sums later. The concept that a medical card can be used to provide only treatment in an age in which so much knowledge of prevention exists is outdated. Prevention should be top of the list.</P>
      <P>As I was a student in Belfast, I am called for smear testing every two years. Despite my Donegal address and attempts to encourage the practice in question to accept that I am no longer a patient, I continue to receive the communication. I imagine there is a legal requirement to continue to inform me that the practice is available to perform a smear test. It is very comforting to think that someone is watching out for people and calling them for testing rather than leaving matters in their hands. It was recently said that if one did not have to take one&rsquo;s car to the car testing centre, one would not do it. It is because one gets a letter that one attends, despite that the test is provided ultimately for one&rsquo;s safety.</P>
      <P>It is important to find out if something is wrong before it becomes a problem that can kill. The faster we create screening programmes which call people for tests, the better. Such programmes should include cervical smears, breast examinations and tests for male cancers, including prostate cancer, which kill just as many people per year as their female counterparts. While I acknowledge that there are cost implications in extending the medical card system, I implore the T&aacute;naiste and her officials to consider the long-term gains rather than the short-term pains. As with the smoking ban, any short-term pain such as expenditure on medical cards is bound to yield a preventative result.</P>
      <P>Previously, the Minister discussed the efforts of successive Governments to keep older people at home or within their communities in residential care. There have been tremendous advances in primary care provision in my area. I attended another briefing recently at which a group sought to promote a holistic approach to primary care. When I asked them what could be done to improve services in the north west, they had to apologise and say that if they had realised I was from the region, they would have told me how proactive the former North Western Health Board had been in improving services.</P><Col N="1449"/>
      <P>Many people want to help people to stay at home, but there are simple problems. A few months ago, a constituent of mine was assessed for a home subvention which was approved. The family has not received any support to this day. None of them is particularly wealthy and every one of them is involved in activity. Some of them are students and some of them work. However, they are doing their best to keep the show on the road. They could easily have told their father they were going to leave him in a home or in one of the hospitals, but they chose not to because they wanted to deal with the matter themselves. However, they need a break and a bit of support. Spending months trying to get home subvention is not in keeping with what is said about the policy of trying to help keep older people in their own location.</P>
      <P>I wish Ms Gertie Monagle, the former matron of Carndonagh Community Hospital, well in her retirement and wish her replacement, Ms Maura Gillen, every success. She said her goal is to ensure that people coming to the hospital live until they die. One hopes this is the goal in many district hospitals. In Ms Gillen&rsquo;s case, Carndonagh&rsquo;s gain will be Buncrana&rsquo;s loss. However, she is in the area and will make sweeping changes.</P>
      <P>There is a question whether money should have been taken in the past, but this Bill will ensure that money is taken in future. It is important that money will be applied exclusively to the health services and will not go back into the general Exchequer. The Minister said earlier that it is part of health funding and should be maintained in that area because it is needed there.</P>
      <P>The new doctor visitor medical card will attempt to target 200,000 people. There are adjustments in the income guidelines in respect of standard medical cards, and changes will help 30,000 people qualify for the standard medical card. Perhaps there could be a certain number of free prescriptions or doctor visits for people who fall just outside the general guidelines.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new provisions for parents of children with illnesses which persist from year to year. This is a new concept and I hope it will help the vast number of people who need it. The provisions mean that they will not need to reapply for the medical card every year. I know many people affected by this and, unfortunately, the children will never get better. Until medical science advances significantly, the types of conditions they have will not improve, yet they are subjected to medical card income reviews. These are not even based on income but on medical evidence. I am glad the system is being changed.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to a small number of children with serious illnesses who will be involved. The number will not be very small, but neither will it be very large. I have come across people who, at a very young age, have degenerative rheumatoid arthritis. At the age of 20 they have to get two hips or possibly an elbow replaced, yet they must <Col N="1450"/>prove every year that they have a problem with their health. I do not understand this situation. They have a serious medical condition and a doctor can reasonably state they will not get better. It is similar to disability benefit in that somebody whose case is solid and whose situation will never substantially change should not have to go on to a scheme to prove him or herself for a year. Perhaps we are being optimistic in thinking that something might change.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with the drugs payment scheme increasing considerably because for many of the people to whom I refer, the prescription might be the bother. Some people try to be clever or prudent by going at the start of the month to get their medication and then again on the very last day of the month to get the next month&rsquo;s supply. The pharmacist tells them they cannot do that and must come back tomorrow and pay another &euro;85. I am unsure of the standard procedure in this regard. Is the pharmacist right or is the individual right in trying to maximise what he or she gets in the month? I would like the matter clarified at a later date.</P>
      <P>A figure for gross income might suggest that a household earns a great deal of money. What if the spouse does not get a fraction of that money? Often a spouse can have a medical problem but may not be in a position to go to the doctor because he or she does not get a fair share of the money coming into the household. I know of cases where people are living on very meagre weekly allowances and must save to get the money to go to the doctor. We should be aware of genuine cases, flexibility should be maintained with regard to welfare officers and people must realise that sometimes such shocking situations exist.</P>
      <P>I was trying to attain a broader modernisation agenda with regard to medical cards. Section 4 of the Bill deals with those who are exempt, a person&rsquo;s reasonable expenses needs are taken into account in the application of section 45, and the issue of undue hardship is reflected in that.</P>
      <P>We have potentially one of the best health systems in the north west. The hospital in Letterkenny constantly strives to have more facilities and is achieving more specialties. It is also achieving great birth rates because the population in Letterkenny has increased by 42%. Hospital facilities, however, have not expanded to meet population needs or the ageing profile of the demography or the new specialties which need space. However, we have one of the most committed staff in the country, if not Europe.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue on the Adjournment debate last week. This is not bed blocking or a case that one hears of in another part of the country where people are crying wolf. These are genuine facts backed up by statistics. Thirty thousand people cannot go through an accident and emergency department with only six bays. People referred by general practitioners and in need of inpatient terms of stay cannot be dealt with without sup<Col N="1451"/>port for the accident and emergency unit &mdash; which is being progressed &mdash; and providing a significant number of new beds. There is no viable reason for a delay. We can talk about the need for money, but if the statistics and facts are irrefutable, the matter must be progressed.</P>
      <P>A nursing unit in Buncrana needs simple stuff such as tarmac in the car park, PVC windows, fascia board and work on the main entrance. Given that an application has been made to the minor capital works scheme, that will happen. With regard to the hospital in Carndonagh, I hope the extension to the dining area, the day hospital, the required painting and decorating and the tarring will proceed.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste should speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, with regard to voluntary housing schemes where volunteers develop a number of sheltered housing locations. In some cases, particularly at district hospitals, people are fit to leave hospital but their families are not in a position to deal with them. However, with a little support, these people would be able to live on their own. There should be a move between the Departments of Health and Children and Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure sheltered accommodation for people who are fit to leave hospital. It would be worthwhile if they could move into sheltered accommodation with either a nurse or a caretaker to oversee them and ensure they are in safe hands.</P>
      <P>The BreastCheck service and a breast surgeon are needed for Letterkenny.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion. It is clear from our discussions in this House that the McCartney case has struck a chord with people North and South, and overseas. It is not hard to see why. First, from what we know of Robert, he is someone with whom many people can identify &mdash; a family man respected in his community, with no connections to paramilitarism or criminality. There was nothing to mark him out as someone who might meet with a violent death; nothing, it seems, except his willingness to stand up for himself and his friend against a particularly evil gang of assailants. That courage is a family characteristic, as embodied by his sisters&rsquo; response to this crime.</P>
	<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Second, the nature of the attack was particularly vicious and brutal. The extent of the injuries to Robert and to his friend, Brendan Devine, tells us much about the nature of the person or people who were involved in the attack. Such senseless violence is frightening in the extreme. It is even more frightening to think that the perpetrators enjoy any sort of organised support, but they do. Despite the words and statements, they have not been handed over to account under the law for what they have done.</P>
      <P>Third, as cited in the motion, what happened after the attack is particularly deplorable. It seems the perpetrators of this crime had at their disposal a team of skilled and ruthless accomplices who were immediately ready and willing to remove from Magennis&rsquo;s Bar every trace of forensic evidence which the crime had produced. They were able to be that composed, while Robert McCartney and Brendan Devine were left for dead on the street outside and no medical help was sought.</P>
      <P>As we know, destruction of evidence is in itself a crime and, as the McCartney family has said, the people who carried out that crime should also be pursued through the courts.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the fourth element of the general revulsion at Robert McCartney&rsquo;s murder. In order to secure a conviction in a society which <Col N="1453"/>operates under the rule of law, the courts rely not only on physical evidence but also on statements from witnesses. There were many witnesses to this murder but to my knowledge few, if any, have yet come forward to make a statement that will lead directly to an arrest.</P>
      <P>The McCartney family believes, and I have no reason to disagree with them, that this is because they have been intimidated or threatened &mdash; another crime. Those involved in witness intimidation must themselves be held accountable before the law. Robert McCartney&rsquo;s life was far too short but in that life he obviously inspired great love and loyalty in his family. The solidarity, bravery and dignity of his sisters and his partner Bridgeen have moved us greatly. They have also been the catalyst for a huge reaction within their own community. They challenged the unspoken rule that paramilitaries and those close to them are somehow untouchable. They challenged the idea that anyone, no matter how well connected, should expect to be able to commit murder and get away with it.</P>
      <P>The IRA has expelled three members who are believed to have been involved in this crime. They claim to have &ldquo;advised&rdquo; them to take responsibility for their actions but this seems to have been advice which has been easy to ignore. Those involved in intimidation and destruction of evidence have attracted no censure from the IRA. I call on all political parties to be unambiguous in their advice to those with information on this case. Intimidation must stop. Those in a position of influence in this regard should make 100% clear that witnesses should come forward and that any threats against them will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>The McCartneys have asked people to co-operate with the police in securing convictions. No party which claims to support the family&rsquo;s position can at the same time refuse to acknowledge the need to co-operate with the police. Witness statements must be admissible in court to be of any use. They should be given to the investigating police. When this is done, we look forward to a day in the near future when the criminals from Magennis&rsquo;s Bar can be brought before the courts to answer for their crimes. Then we can hope that the Short Strand community can be allowed to heal itself, free of the menace of criminal gangs who claim immunity for acting as part of a republican movement but use it as a licence for their own local status and interests. Try though it may, Sinn F&eacute;in cannot avoid dealing with this awful deed. Through the members of the republican movement involved in it, they have colluded in the denials and distractions. They have failed to accept the moral clarity required. They have failed to bring their own paramilitaries to book. If those who wield the armalite can so casually damage their own ballot box, and be protected for it, we may reasonably ask of Sinn F&eacute;in which they value more. We will have our answer when they lift their reservations and the killers of <Col N="1454"/>Robert McCartney stand in the dock and face justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The killing of Robert McCartney was by any standards, as Deputy Kirk has said, a cruel and horrific murder perpetrated by a gang of brutal cowards. That this was done to an innocent victim is bad enough, but that his family and loved ones have been forced to take on themselves an immensely brave, public struggle to bring the perpetrators to justice, compounds the naked evil of his murder.</P>
      <P>Having met and spoken to his sisters and his partner here in Dublin, I am lost in admiration for their unique combination of bravery, dignity, determination and hunger for justice. They are not seeking vengeance or retribution, they are merely seeking justice. They could simply have imploded emotionally from the shock, grief and outrage of the savage attack on Robert, which would have been the reaction for most of us faced with their terrible experience. These brave women refused to be trampled down by thuggery, however, and they refused to let the light of justice be snuffed out by fear. Nothing will bring Robert McCartney back from the dead but, equally, nothing will wash away the stain which his killing has left on the provisional movement. Nothing but the arrest, trial and conviction of his murderers will amount to justice in this case. His loved ones are right to insist that the agencies of public justice should have access to the evidence needed to bring his murderers to the bar of justice. We should remember that information and intelligence, no matter how reliable, are not admissible as evidence in courts. There is no substitute for witnesses. Due process, whether North or South, requires that statements of proposed witnesses should be served on the accused before there can be a trial or, for that matter, a conviction.</P>
      <P>This is not the first cowardly killing of this type. Torture and mutilation are, I regret to tell the House, part of the Provo&rsquo;s stock-in-trade. The threat of murder drives many, if not all, of their base criminal activities. The greatest provisional republican deceit, which has been swallowed by a small minority of media commentators, is the suggestion that IRA thuggery and criminality is the sole responsibility of the IRA and that Sinn F&eacute;in is some separate democratic chrysalis seeking to break out of a paramilitary cocoon and become an exclusively peaceful and democratic butterfly. People pose as liberation politicians but I am afraid that as regards the provisional movement, the truth is more Mugabe than Mandela.</P>
      <P>The provisional movement is a single entity which terms itself the republican movement. It has a single leadership. The entire movement, including Sinn F&eacute;in, regards that leadership as the authentic source of political legitimacy on this island. Its decisions are law. Its murders are mere executions. Its tortures are but punishments. Its robberies are just legitimate expropriations. Its <Col N="1455"/>network of crime and money laundering are merely the financing of the movement. As we all now know, its actions are, by definition, never criminal. The public is beginning to see the shape of the threat to democracy posed by a movement which uses crime on a massive scale to engage in politics. What has been on view in recent weeks is but the tip of an iceberg. While the public were led to believe that the provisional movement was  struggling internally to leap directly, in a clean break, from paramilitarism to politics, the truth was a little more complex. It was, and is, that the army council was preparing to transform the provisional movement by stealth into one in which the political loss-making &ldquo;hardware division&rdquo; of the IRA, with its semtex, kalashnikovs, rockets and missiles, was to be replaced with a lightly-armed IRA <i>gendarmerie</i>. The latter would in future act as the enforcers for the criminal and control strategy underpinning Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s drive for political power. We now know that the IRA was not planning to go away. It was planning to mutate into something else. It would be the lightly armed means whereby the crime went on, the smuggling zone in the Border counties was protected, the rule of the army council was to be enforced, the funds for politics and power were to be amassed and the Short Strand and many other enclaves were to be dominated and ruled. It was to be the means whereby opponents and rivals would be intimidated and silenced.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about another murder victim, Eamonn Collins. His mutilated body was found a few years ago by the roadside in Newry. His death rivalled that of Robert McCartney in terms of the barbarity and cowardice of the perpetrators. In his case, however, he knew he was a marked man. His crime was to testify before a Dublin jury, to tell the truth and point out that Thomas &ldquo;Slab&rdquo; Murphy was chief of staff of the IRA and a member of its army council. His crime was to show that the libel case which was being brought against <i>The Sunday Times</i> was a colossal lie and an attempt to punish the media for telling the truth. The jury of Dubliners believed Mr. Collins.</P>
      <P>I mention this case because a handful of media commentators still refuses to face up to the truth about the IRA. They apparently do not want to know who is involved. They do not want to see who raided the Northern Bank, how they are laundering the money and what they want to spend it on. I remind them that free speech has its moral duties as well as its legal rights. I also remind them that a terrible price was paid by Eamonn Collins for the right of the Irish people to know the truth about the IRA and its leadership, and for the right of the media to publish the truth. The Provos exacted that price.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that any journalist, especially that small minority of journalists who refuse to see the truth, would never forget the fate of Eamonn Collins, or for that matter forget <Col N="1456"/>what the moral duty of professional practitioners of free speech which journalists are, demands of them. Like the sisters and partner of Robert McCartney, it demands bravery. That is the issue we have to reflect on tonight, it is simply a matter of bravery. The community across Ireland has to stand up in just the same way as the 300 people who went on the march the other day and confront the threat to our democracy, the rule of law and life itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the short time available I wish to support the motion and make a few observations. In deploring the murder of Robert McCartney by members of the IRA and others, and commending his family&rsquo;s remarkable courage in demanding justice, it is worth remembering there are 2,000 other unresolved murders arising from the Troubles in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>What makes this murder so significant politically and in terms of its implications for Sinn F&eacute;in is not that it cannot be wrapped in the immunity usually conferred by the &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; but that it has come at a time when that central question of IRA criminality is now the single obstacle to achieving a final settlement of the conflict as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>As has previously been said in the debate, this was no drunken brawl, it was premeditated slaughter. It was a cover up by those who abused their power, a power which for decades has rendered the IRA immune from criminality and even disapproval in the eyes of its own community. Over the past few months Sinn F&eacute;in leaders have found themselves refusing to describe past republican actions as crimes. To concede that label of criminality for IRA activities over 30 years would offend the integrity of what its members perceive to be their struggle against injustice and occupation. In their minds it would be a slur, a diminishing of their version of history, which is noble and patriotic. Those republicans who killed and died for Ireland must from a Sinn F&eacute;in perspective be retrospectively protected from the label of common criminality. One man&rsquo;s crime was another man&rsquo;s patriotic struggle for justice.</P>
      <P>After years of protracted discussions there is still no shared or agreed view of the cause of the conflict; perhaps there never will be. What we had hoped for in the peace process was for the building of a shared vision for the future and a fresh start. Whatever about putting behind us the crimes of the past, post-Good Friday Agreement there cannot be any acceptance of ongoing criminality.</P>
      <P>The peace process was built on the basis of acceptance of the integrity of the other side&rsquo;s quarrel. It was about burying the hatchet and working together to agree a settlement, which would remove the cause of the conflict. It required significant concessions from all of us, the release of prisoners, evacuating treasured constitutional positions, inclusion in democratic politics of former paramilitaries, the demilitarisation of <Col N="1457"/>Northern Irish society, reform of policing and judicial systems, admissions of past failures and a plethora of inquiries into the wrongs of the past.</P>
      <P>For those Ministers close to the process &mdash; there have been Ministers from many parties &mdash; it has been an exercise of faith, hope and, unfortunately, serial disappointment. It was a high-risk investment. As David Trimble said, it was a &ldquo;white-knuckle ride&rdquo;. I reject the suggestion that the Governments turned a blind eye to criminality. The job of Governments in the process was to steer a ship through stormy waters, to progressively build confidence among the parties representing paramilitaries, which would result in an exodus from violence and the embrace of democracy and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Many of us had &ldquo;dark nights of the soul&rdquo; about the risks being taken with fundamental democratic principles. We knew on Good Friday that the Agreement was just a start. Sadly since then we have lurched from crisis to crisis but in the round, as Mo Mowlam would say, things are immeasurably better. I do not despair or recriminate that it has taken this long to come to the crunch decision for Sinn F&eacute;in on the issue of criminality. It is a critical challenge and opportunity for that party. For a long time we were stuck on the issue of decommissioning of weapons. George Mitchell once said it was the decommissioning of the mindset that mattered. We are at that juncture now.</P>
      <P>I do not begrudge or question Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s mandate. The whole idea of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement was that Sinn F&eacute;in would embrace politics, that politics would work for its members and that they could legitimately pursue their political aspirations through totally non-violent means. Never for a moment did we imagine that thuggery and criminality would replace the military campaign as a <i>modus operandi</i>.</P>
      <P>As one who engaged with Sinn F&eacute;in in good faith as a Minister of State in respectful negotiations I urge those in Sinn F&eacute;in and the many thousands of people who support them to be worthy of the trust which I and many others placed in them in the past ten years. They should not use weasel words in responding to the McCartney family. They should seize the opportunity to take a new road for the republican movement. Peace with justice has become a Sinn F&eacute;in mantra. For too long justice has been a one-way street. Human rights was something it demanded; not something it ever imagined would be expected of it. How else could the barbarity of punishment attacks on young dysfunctional youths be squared with human rights? It is difficult to understand why the wider republican community has given the IRA immunity for those terrible crimes over many years?</P>
      <P>The brave McCartney sisters are not only posing compelling and uncomfortable questions for Sinn F&eacute;in, they are posing the same questions to their own community. They are asking if they <Col N="1458"/>really need protectors who are battering their own people to death when the mood takes them. It is truly a defining moment to see the people of the Short Strand rise up against IRA criminality. Mo Mowlam&rsquo;s dream of the peace process becoming a people&rsquo;s project is just starting to become a reality for the people of the Short Strand and the wider republican community. I hope the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership has the courage to listen to and hear the strong messages coming from within its own constituency. Perhaps we have come to a time when Sinn F&eacute;in and the rest of us can at least have a shared understanding of what is justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in deploring the murder of Robert McCartney. It would be impossible to do otherwise. Any murder is abhorrent, but Robert McCartney&rsquo;s murder was particularly shocking. A murder which apparently arose from a bar room brawl quickly escalated into a cover up operation, startling in both its speed and its scale. This is something which would normally only be undertaken by a structured and trained organisation. It was an automatic reflex by an organisation determined to protect its own. There was no question of even rudimentary justice. The first instinct was to get away with it; for self-survival. Whoever they were, the people who rendered Magennis&rsquo;s bar forensically sterile are guilty of a very serious crime. They should face prosecution for their actions as surely as the person or persons who were guilty of stabbing Robert McCartney and Brendan Devine should face prosecution.</P>
      <P>In order for such prosecutions to be successful and in the regrettable absence of physical evidence, witnesses will have to take the stand against these men. I am happy to respond to the motion by adding my voice to those of other public representatives who have encouraged those with knowledge of this crime to give statements to the investigating police so that the justice in the courts sought by the McCartney family can be achieved.</P>
      <P>When laws are drafted and enacted in this House or any other parliament in the world, we build in protections to ensure that no one can be convicted without compelling evidence. However, as legislators we are particularly affronted when those protections are abused by the guilty to protect themselves from conviction for their misdeeds. Destroying evidence and intimidating witnesses hits at the very foundation of a criminal justice system. Although the situation seems bleak at present, I hope and believe that justice will be done in the end. The demands of the McCartney family should not and must not be ignored and the will of the people cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>When those accused of the crimes which took place in Magennis&rsquo;s bar come to justice, they will face the consequences of their actions. Are they so far removed from any sense of morality or per<Col N="1459"/>sonal responsibility that they are more content to expend their energies on protecting themselves and yet damage the cause to which they claim absolute allegiance? We deplore the summary justice of paramilitaries. This House does not recognise any &ldquo;court martial&rdquo; held by the IRA. The IRA is not qualified or mandated to try anyone. Only the courts can perform that role, operating under the laws enacted by democratically-elected representatives of the people.</P>
      <P>The McCartney family has made a simple, dignified and consistent plea for those with information to co-operate with the police. We can only imagine the strain which the events of recent weeks have placed on the family. They have found themselves not only bereaved but suddenly on centre stage as spokeswomen for their community. I hope they are drawing strength from the support they are receiving. It is evident in the House today, as it was last night, that there is almost unanimous support for this motion.</P>
      <P>The people of the Short Strand too have found themselves in agreement on the McCartney case, which represents a fundamental moral choice and a key political decision for the party most implicated in it. They have come out publicly in support of the McCartney family, standing in vigil on the streets of their community, wanting justice to be done, appalled that anyone, much less their erstwhile political leaders, should shield the perpetrators from the law. Their comments have prompted Sinn F&eacute;in to make some public statements. However, in those statements and in the amendment which they presented to this House on this motion, Sinn F&eacute;in does not accept the core issue, which is the need to work with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Instead of leading, Sinn F&eacute;in has taken the back seat hoping all of this will go away. Much hard work on the ground has gone into the reform of the police service in Northern Ireland. With no help from Sinn F&eacute;in, local communities have nominated representatives to district policing partnerships to work with the policing board to deliver a service which can inspire the confidence of all the community. No one is asking Sinn F&eacute;in to make a leap of faith on policing, only to co-operate with the fundamental role of the police in bringing the perpetrators of a heinous crime to justice.</P>
      <P>We have seen what can happen in a community where public support for policing is obstructed. It allows, and is meant to allow, a situation where paramilitaries are themselves entirely beyond the law. That attitude was the critical factor in the murder of Robert McCartney and its attempted cover-up. That is why it has such implications for society and the peace process as a whole. However, the McCartney family, the people of the Short Strand and the plain people of Ireland will no longer stand for those who set themselves up as an alternative judge, jury and executioner at the expense of justice for an innocent man <Col N="1460"/>slaughtered without compunction. I support the motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion is very difficult in the context of having met with the McCartney family, acknowledging and identifying in every way possible with the situation in which they find themselves. The sisters of the late Robert McCartney and his partner, Bridgeen, it must been acknowledged have been an inspiration to us all to uphold justice with clarity, without ambiguity and without being a prisoner of whatever conditioning any of us have picked up along the way. The lesson I have learned from the McCartney family is that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann can do nothing other than recommend that people go to the PSNI. To do anything else would indicate a lack of respect for the laws which people voted for and the institutions of the State here or those in the North, which were copper-fastened by the Good Friday Agreement, and were only to be changed having set that reference point in place.</P>
      <P>The reason we are here is to ask why people are not coming forward to give evidence. People are scared and the question of why they are scared must be answered here tonight. There is no doubt that they are scared of the summary killings, beatings, intimidation and the harassment of family members. They are also scared when even former Sinn F&eacute;in members such as Martin Cunningham are derided by Sinn F&eacute;in members on his council when he called for justice. I am sure people do not need to be reminded of the various atrocities perpetrated by loyalists, republicans or state forces but people are scared.</P>
      <P>I was in Belfast at the weekend and found that people cannot accept that Sinn F&eacute;in is serious about the policing issue given that the party knows members of the Provisional IRA have gone to the police with their solicitors following car crashes, burglaries and so on. The police have been there and republicans are dealing with the police at one level. Therefore, it is important that it is taken into account. People find it hard to accept that this is anything other than cold-blooded murder when, whatever about the orders given to kill Robert McCartney and attempt to murder Brendan Devine, an order was certainly given to undertake a forensically sophisticated clean-up afterwards. People also find it hard to see this murder as anything other than a calculated attempted to exert control on the community. Why was no ambulance called? Only for the passing police patrol, we would be discussing two murders tonight.</P>
      <P>This vicious murder and attempted murder brings into sharp and inescapably clear relief a <Col N="1461"/>dual reality in regard to the definition of what a crime is and the constitutional definition of a crime. We must go beyond that. Due to this dual reality, the D&aacute;il is not singing from the same hymn sheet with regard to what justice is and how to achieve it. This day of reckoning was bound to come. Now it is here. I appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in, in the interests of everybody, to seize the day and the challenge and recognise this reality. Justice will not be done unless the police is assisted with its inquiry in every way. This will in itself be a catalyst for transformed and fruitful progress towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which is our common goal.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to recognise that we are still in a sensitive political situation. This debate is not the most helpful way of dealing with it. We should be dealing on a one-to-one basis. Opposition parties have been excluded from the process for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In the last paragraph, after &ldquo;police&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or, for those who do not support or trust the PSNI, to bring forward any information they may have to the family, a solicitor or any other authoritative or reputable person or body,&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">On my own behalf and on behalf of my fellow Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, I extend deepest sympathy to the McCartney family. The brutal murder of Robert devastated a family and shocked a local community deeply. I met the McCartney family and Robert&rsquo;s partner in Leinster House last week and I salute their courage and determination to achieve truth and justice.</P>
      <P>As the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership locally and nationally has done many times, I reiterate the call for anyone with information on this murder and the circumstances surrounding it to come forward with that information and actively to assist the family. I wish to put on record some of what Sinn F&eacute;in President, Mr. Gerry Adams, said today:</P>
      <P LI="1">My clear intention . . . was to encourage those who have information to make that information available so that whoever is responsible for the killing of Robert McCartney is brought to justice. I note that this has not happened. And although many people have come forward &mdash; others have not, particularly some who may have been directly involved in Robert&rsquo;s murder. In my view these people must give a full account through whatever conduit they choose.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">I want also to restate with absolute clarity that whoever killed Robert McCartney should come forward and take responsibility for this. That is what I meant when I said that if I was involved I would make myself accountable to the courts. So far Robert McCartney&rsquo;s killer has not had the courage to do this. Self-preservation and selfishness will not prevail in this case. I am not letting this issue go until those <Col N="1462"/>who have sullied the republican cause are made to account for their action.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Given that we wish to see truth and justice for the McCartney family, we should not close any avenue through which information or evidence can be brought to light. Sinn F&eacute;in has not sought to close any avenue. People have gone to the PSNI and no doubt others will do so. That is their right and nobody should stand in their way. There are others who do not trust or support the PSNI, not because of what Sinn F&eacute;in says but because of their experiences and that of their communities at the hands of the Northern state. For those people, there are other avenues which can and must be used if they have relevant information.</P>
      <P>This fact has been pointed out by the McCartney family who have said that those with valid reasons for not going to the PSNI should go to a solicitor, the Police Ombudsman or whoever with whom they are comfortable. Mr. Hugh Orde said today he would encourage people to go through a third party if they did not feel confident about going to the PSNI directly. He compared it to his experiences in London where &ldquo;some communities who did not trust us&rdquo; would go through third parties.</P>
      <P>The PSNI also recognised this reality when it began the re-investigation of the loyalist killing of Se&aacute;n Brown in Bellaghy, County Derry. It issued an appeal which encouraged people to use a named firm of solicitors or the Pat Finucane Centre to bring forward information as an alternative to dealing directly with the PSNI. Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s efforts last evening to portray this otherwise merits only contempt. I note that this evening it has been announced that the Police Ombudsman will take statements on the murder of Robert McCartney.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the thrust of the Fine Gael motion. We do not wish to delete a word of it. However, in failing to recognise a reality that even the PSNI concedes, the final paragraph restricts the means by which information may be given to help bring the killers to justice. For this reason, Sinn F&eacute;in asked Fine Gael to accept its amendment which does not detract from but adds to the motion before us. Its refusal is most regrettable.</P>
      <P>Time does not allow me to respond to the stream of party political invective against Sinn F&eacute;in last night and tonight. The refusal of the Fine Gael Party to accept a reasonable proposition, and its contributions and those of other Members of the House, shows what can only be called a cynical exploitation of this serious issue for the narrowest of political motives.</P>
      <P>Misinformation has been flung around the Chamber, not least by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Last night he stated: &ldquo;The only information that will help put the killers of Robert McCartney behind bars is information given directly to the PSNI which will lead to statements that can be used as evidence in a court of law.&rdquo; The Minister had to alter his emphatic position <Col N="1463"/>when the PSNI itself recognised that there were other ways to bring forward information. The Minister who, like so many others, was blinded by his deep rooted antipathy towards Sinn F&eacute;in was obliged to do a complete U-turn today and face reality when he said people could use other avenues as well.</P>
      <P>The logic of that U-turn and of all the information before the House is that every Deputy who truly wants to see justice served in this deplorable case should accept and support the amendment put forward by the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies. If this essential amendment is defeated, we must, regrettably, withhold our endorsement of the motion, only because it is too narrow in its construction.</P>
      <P>Make no mistake, we are not interested in engaging in a party political battle on this issue. Some may be satisfied with a headline tomorrow such as &ldquo;Sinn F&eacute;in isolated&rdquo; as an outcome of this debate. However, I believe the majority of people are interested in truth and justice for the bereaved and that is what Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to pursue.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this discussion. What was different about the murder of Robert McCartney? Why is this crime on everybody&rsquo;s lips? There have been many murders perpetrated by all sides. There have been many victims and the devastation of their families and friends was no less than that of the McCartneys.</P>
      <P>Certainly, the fact that the murder occurred directly after the Northern Bank robbery had an impact. The utter viciousness of the crime coupled with the intimidation and bullying of witnesses were critical. However, the courage of Robert McCartney&rsquo;s family, who faced down that intimidation and who were supported by the local community, has brought us to this point tonight. We could have talked ourselves hoarse condemning the murder and there could have been reams of newsprint condemning the awful act but they would not have mattered. What mattered was that friends, neighbours and other decent people from the area supported the family. Ultimately, the community shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;. It took people power to turn the tide and to seek justice and truth.</P>
      <P>I listened to Robert McCartney&rsquo;s aunt on the radio programme &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; two weeks ago and was riveted by what she said. She spoke the simple truth without spin. She described life as it is and Robert&rsquo;s death as it was. She forced all of us to confront the horror of the situation. I welcome the statement by Gerry Kelly this afternoon, echoed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in this evening, that Sinn F&eacute;in is behind people who are prepared to come forward and give evidence about the murder.</P>
      <P>It was suggested initially that this could undermine the peace process. I disagree. I believe it will move it forward. Peace is more than the <Col N="1464"/>absence of war. It means that communities and individuals are free from intimidation, regardless of where it originates. Robert McCartney&rsquo;s murder requires us to confront that truth. Watching the participants in the peace process over many years, in which many people were involved, I often thought very few women were involved. In terms of conflict resolution, women often have a different perspective, not better or worse, just different. It has taken the women of the McCartney family to make us confront the truth about intimidation and fear in communities. That recognition is a significant step in moving the peace process forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I met the McCartney family last week in Leinster House. I gave them a commitment that I would support them in their efforts to get justice for their brother. That is why in this debate I welcome the opportunity to support them and once again offer my deepest sympathy.</P>
      <P>This horrific murder must be dealt with and the perpetrators brought to justice immediately. Regardless of politics, this must be faced. I also ask that the political parties in this House and other places not use the murder of an innocent man to score political points. This debate is about the murder of Robert McCartney and the best way for his family to get justice. I urge those trying to slip in other issues to respect the feelings and sensitivities of the families.</P>
      <P>From my experience of working on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, particularly on the sub-committee on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1972 to 1974, it is important to always put the victims and their families first, at the top of the agenda. I again urge caution, sensitivity and respect for the family&rsquo;s feelings. Sadly, this is not happening at present.</P>
      <P>I support the motion but have some sympathy for the amendment. We support the McCartney family. We must also take on board that sections of the Nationalist population, after 30 years of violence, death, destruction and collusion, have problems with policing. This amendment gives them an opportunity to come forward. Hugh Orde today agreed with that position and I believe that some members of the McCartney family support it. Members should reflect on this as we all want the McCartney family to make progress.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is one simple solution to this issue, namely, that the perpetrators come forward and give themselves up. This immediately deals with the issue of intimidation and saves the family protracted grief. I would say the same regarding the Brian Murphy case. The people involved should take responsibility for their actions. There should be no fudge on this issue. Let us also remind ourselves of the words of the great Martin Luther King who said:</P><Col N="1465"/>
      <P LI="1">Forgiveness does not mean ignoring what was done or putting a false label on an evil act. It means, rather, that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That barrier will be removed when the McCartney family get justice.</P>
      <P>I deplore all sectarian violence and I call for an end to all sectarian attacks in the North. I deplore the fact that the Oireachtas sub-committee on the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1972 and 1973 did not receive co-operation from the Northern Irish and British authorities. I demand that the suffering of all victims be addressed. I call for the removal of all guns from the island of Ireland. Then we will all win and the nation can move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, when the monsters who disfigured Brendan Devine and inflicted unspeakable violence on Robert McCartney thought they could escape accountability by cynically organising a forensic cleansing at the crime scene and by intimidating witnesses, they did not reckon on the intervention of six formidable working class women, the McCartney sisters and Bridgeen Hagans. I salute them for their resilience, courage and determination. They have challenged the intimidation of the bullies who became so used to strutting around the Short Strand and Markets area they thought they could literally get away with murder.</P>
      <P>The mobilisation of the community demanding justice is a message to the paramilitary organisations, not only on the republican side but also on the loyalist side, that working class communities in the North have had enough of the undemocratic control exercised by these organisations over their communities. It is ironic it is suggested that the McCartney family might be invited to the White House by President Bush, a man who has visited unspeakable violence on others. I warn that justice for Robert McCartney will not be found in the White House or any other big house but on the streets and in the communities of Northern Ireland in the form of the mobilisation of the community that is taking place. In that sense, a rally that may be organised outside the pub where the atrocity took place should draw support from throughout Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole, the trade union movement and, I hope, activists and working class people from Protestant and Catholic areas.</P>
      <P>I may be convinced that Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA are serious about their demands that justice be done when witnesses come forward and tell what they know because this would mean the intimidation has been lifted. I will support the Sinn F&eacute;in addendum to the motion so that no one who can assist in bringing these killers to justice has any excuse for not coming forward. However, that addendum or people coming forward in that way will only have effect if those people are prepared to give evidence in court about the atrocity they <Col N="1466"/>saw and name those who carried it out. This must be added as a rider to this call that people can come forward without necessarily going to the PSNI.</P>

	<P>This is a very important debate. It is the second time in recent weeks Fine Gael has devoted its Private Members&rsquo; time to such an important issue, the national issue, the ideal of peace in our land and, particularly, the ending of violence in our country forever. I listened carefully to the Sinn F&eacute;in speaker, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. He missed the whole point of the Fine Gael motion, which was summed up when Deputy Kenny urged Sinn F&eacute;in to &ldquo;match their pious announcements with real action and let the tragic death of Robert McCartney be the catalyst for the separation of Sinn F&eacute;in from its criminal associates once and for all&rdquo;. It is not for the isolation of Sinn F&eacute;in but the IRA that the motion is before the House. This is the real difference between all the parties in this country and D&aacute;il. We want a total end forever to violence. The only way to achieve this is by taking the peaceful path.</P>
      <P>Today, I viewed the Sinn F&eacute;in website to ascertain the links and connections, seamless or otherwise, between Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA. Perhaps it is a small matter, but for sale for &euro;15 on the Sinn F&eacute;in website &mdash; not the IRA website &mdash; was a T-shirt printed with the phrase &ldquo;The IRA &mdash; the undefeated army&rdquo; and another IRA T-shirt. I will not go into other issues in regard to the website. It is when those items are no longer for sale on the Sinn F&eacute;in website and when there is crystal clarity in regard to where Sinn F&eacute;in stands on the issue of violence that there will be total acceptance of its political position.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in goes on about republicanism and claims it is the republican party. The reality is that any true democrat is a true republican because what he or she wants is a true democracy. He or she wants liberty, equality and fraternity, the true ideals of republicanism and the ideals of Wolfe Tone, which sprang from the French Revolution and which are in all our hearts and minds. All the parties in this House exclude violence totally from that equation of republicanism and nationalism, and do so without fear. We speak in the House, stand before the electorate and fight our fight in the political field.</P>
      <P>Whatever reasons there might have been in the 1790s for the struggle of the United Irishmen, given the economic and political position between Britain and Ireland as they were, none of these reasons survives. As I said before, in the British Houses of Parliament we have a united policy on Northern Ireland. We have a policy regarding this country and in Downing Street we have a Prime Minister who has no imperialist <Col N="1467"/>views or ideas. For many years the British Government has sought to have peace in our land, peace between green and orange, and it has sought to assist that peace. In America we have had a very influential number of recent presidents, in particular President Clinton, and indeed President Bush, who are making every possible effort to bring about peace. They have brought in Sinn F&eacute;in and their leaders and have allowed them to raise money in the US. There was no need to raid banks. They were allowed to run a perfectly legitimate operation in another country because the Americans and British want what the Irish want, an end forever to violence. That is the message.</P>
      <P>Those of us who went to school and did our bit of Leaving Certificate science learned about titration of chemicals. Historically one had the green, nationalist colour and the orange one. Mixed together, unfortunately up to now the colour that has emerged has been the colour of blood, such as was spilled a month ago in Belfast. We are talking of the blood of thousands of people who have died. What we are trying to do, and what successive governments, oppositions and everyone wants is a re-mixing of those colours with the result being peace, or a white colour. It can be done scientifically and it can be done in the hearts and minds of the people.</P>
      <P>This is what the people want. They are entitled to it and must get it. The ambiguity in Sinn F&eacute;in, obvious in their website and their words, must end. It may be that because of the grip the IRA has on the people of Belfast or certain parts of it, none of the 70 people who saw the murder could use a mobile phone for fear of dying themselves. An ambulance could not be called for fear that those who called it would also end up on the street with the poor people attacked. If the grip of the IRA is so strong, Sinn F&eacute;in must walk away from it. At the end of what they call the struggle, that violent struggle, we can talk business and then walk together into the future Ireland that people want.</P>
      <P>The current situation cannot continue. We are now at the final point. The people will put up with this no longer. If the McCartney family cannot get justice for the awful murder perpetrated on their brother because of fear and intimidation, another justice can be meted out. That is the justice of the voice of the people through the ballot boxes, North and South. This must happen. If people are terrorised by the IRA and fearful of it, and none can blame them when we see what has happened, then the greater truth will become known. I do not know if Gerry Adams is going to the White House on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day but I damn well think the McCartney family should be there because they speak for all of us.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we want an end to the violence. We support the McCartney family in its struggle. It is very difficult to stand up to fear and <Col N="1468"/>intimidation. It is very difficult if one has been a Sinn F&eacute;in voter to go out on the street and get 200 or 300 people to say &ldquo;Yes, we backed you. We want an end to this&rdquo;. It is going to happen because the people will make it happen.</P>
      <P>This is the moment for Sinn F&eacute;in to grasp. I echo Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s concluding comments. Sinn F&eacute;in must grasp peace now, go for it and stand apart from the IRA. We want Sinn F&eacute;in in this House. We want it to play its full part in democratic politics but there can no longer be any ambiguity about violence, death, murder and intimidation. There must be an end to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd for sharing time. I am delighted to speak on this important motion. Looking back at the 20th century, when Fine Gael stood for a united Ireland, going back to Arthur Griffith, we have a long history of campaigning for that great ideal.</P>
      <P>All of us have been inspired by the courage of Robert McCartney&rsquo;s family, its bravery in standing up to the hoods and rejecting intimidation. That has been a turning point in the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The family has shown a persistent unwillingness to accept double-speak or lame excuses and is committed in its quest for justice. It is hard for us to fathom the family&rsquo;s ability to pursue this objective so relentlessly in light of the immense grief it has suffered. However, the family has secured one objective which thousands have failed to achieve previously. It has shown that the IRA can be shamed into adopting the standards of behaviour accepted in every normal decent society.</P>
      <P>It is shameful that it took the IRA nearly a month to respond and that its members and supporters played such an instrumental role initially in destroying evidence and intimidating witnesses. For far too long, the IRA and its political suits have managed to evade, avoid and subvert through the clever use of evasive language and the constant portrayal of their members as victims. What the McCartney murder has shown is that in this instance the real victims of the Troubles in Northern Ireland are the very communities the IRA claims to protect. The savagery and brutality inflicted on Mr. McCartney display a sick and psychopathic mindset. It is hard to see how people could be held in such high esteem in any so-called army of justice when they can so coldly and callously butcher a defenceless man and leave him to die. Even more disturbing has been the way the republican movement in Belfast was able to orchestrate a riot when police sought to investigate the crime and how it expertly disposed of the forensic evidence in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in cannot use the words freedom, truth and justice as long as the killers of Robert McCartney remain at large. Any organisation which objects to or frustrates the investigation of this crime by the police and the prosecution of the wrongdoers by the courts can play no part in the normal political processes. Such organisations <Col N="1469"/>should be shunned and excluded until they clearly demonstrate an understanding of the basic requirement of transparent accountability for such wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>What has also been inspirational about the McCartney women is that they have refused to accept spin or prevarication. They have also laid out their objectives very clearly and will not rest until they have been achieved. This is one of the few occasions where I have seen the slick Sinn F&eacute;in PR machine cough and splutter. It is also a rare event to see the IRA humbled and humiliated to the extent that it had to issue two statements and go through the charade of expelling three volunteers.</P>
      <P>The McCartney killing must bring home to us that it is time to end all the charades including the one that the IRA is the legitimate army or that it deserves to be recognised as having the various organisational elements associated with the Irish Army in this State. There is no place for the IRA or its structures in modern Ireland and the sooner it closes camp and removes the cloud of shame that must hang over some of its elected members in this House, the better.</P>
      <P>The impact on the southern six counties has been huge. There has been a considerable impact on the potential for economic development across the Border and the opportunities which peace would bring to the whole island, particularly to the six Border counties. It is regrettable that when the opportunity for peace is there, the level of criminality which exists across the Border has such an impact on so many institutions of the State. This is a watershed. Sinn F&eacute;in must stand back from the criminality of the IRA and embrace the democratic process. We are going to move on and we cannot have two armies in the State. The McCartney sisters have put it up to Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA that people will no longer tolerate the situation. What was covered up was entirely regrettable and would not have been revealed but for the sheer determination of the McCartney sisters to seek justice. There is now no place for the IRA. That has impacted on the economic development of Sligo and all the Border counties. Fine Gael has had a long history campaigning for a united Ireland and it is regrettable that thousands of people lost their lives for no gain. Punishment beatings, the recent bank robbery and racketeering have diminished Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad but I hope prosecutions will follow. The cover up that took place in Belfast with the removal of forensic evidence is regrettable but I am confident witnesses will come forward and the people responsible will be brought to justice and serve their time. This is an important motion and it is important that Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA should get the message. We have a solid mandate to debate this issue, as have the people of Ireland. It is time Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA listened and took heed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The killing of Robert McCartney has left a family without a father, a son and a brother and this terrible loss must be <Col N="1470"/>acknowledged. He was an innocent man having a drink with his friend, Brendan Devine, and he should have been able to go home to his family when the pub closed. Instead, he was systematically stabbed, cut open like a gutted fish, brutally kicked in the head and left to die. This barbaric act was carried out by known members of the provisional movement who proceeded to lock the doors of the pub, instruct those inside not to call an ambulance and set about removing every piece of evidence to cover up their bloody trail as Robert McCartney lay dying in an alleyway.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>If this killing had been carried out by a loyalist gang, Sinn F&eacute;in spokespeople would have been first to demand justice but the butchers of the Short Strand belong to their organisation and Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA tried to cover up the truth by pretending this was nothing more than a drunken brawl. They denied involvement until the pressure built to such a point that denial was fruitless.</P>
      <P>The provisional movement has been forced to give ground for weeks in the face of the dignified grief and implacable courage of Robert McCartney&rsquo;s sisters &mdash; Paula, Gemma, Catherine, Donna, Clare &mdash; and his partner, Bridgeen. I pay tribute to these ordinary women who have become extraordinary out of their tragedy. They inspire in all of us hope for the future of Northern Ireland. Their bravery has triumphed over those whom they rightly describe as &ldquo;psychopaths with power&rdquo;. Justice has not been delivered to them yet but there is an imperative about the righteousness of their cause.</P>
      <P>They will not give up their quest for justice and they are not alone. The community in the Short Strand is standing with them both in their sorrow and in their struggle for human rights. Last night the democratically elected members of Belfast City Council stood with them and tonight we, the democratic community of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, also stand with them.</P>
      <P>The provisional movement has for so long held sway in communities such as the Short Strand but it is under pressure. Following all the punishment beatings, intimidation, exiling, extortion and other criminality, the claim of being the protector of this community, which the IRA has made for years, has finally been exposed for what it is, a lie. There is no justification for the ongoing existence of the IRA and no case whatsoever for an armed conspiracy that shelters within its ranks the murderers of Robert McCartney. No matter what claims its members make, they are not the defenders of nationalist communities.</P>
      <P>The record shows that the IRA has killed more people than the combined forces of the UDA, UFF, UVF, RUC and the British Army. It is estimated that more than 400 Catholics died at the hands of the IRA. The recent revelations by Richard O&rsquo;Rawe about the H-Block hunger strike and the role of the army council show that when it comes to its own members, the IRA has acted with breathtaking callousness. Men died on hunger strike, according to O&rsquo;Rawe, because <Col N="1471"/>Gerry Adams, on behalf of the army council, prevented them from accepting a deal offered by the British Government. History may judge that revelation in the future but history is being made by the McCartney family, who have challenged all of us to confront the role, purpose and methods of the provisional movement. There is an obligation on us to support them in every way we can until the killers of their brother are brought to justice.</P>
      <P>People are not only fearful about going to the PSNI. When Robert McCartney and his friend were attacked in Magennis&rsquo;s bar on 30 January and the subsequent events took place, fear of the thugs, not the PSNI, stopped people from calling an ambulance. Until that fear is confronted, as it has been by the McCartney family, it will be extremely difficult to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.</P>
      <P>This is a test of the provisional movement and I urge its members to live up to the test. Others have done it previously. Most parties in this Parliament have been associated with violence in the past. This is the time for Sinn F&eacute;in to move forward. There are decent members in Sinn F&eacute;in who are deeply disturbed by what has happened and that it has not been resolved. There is still fear of retaliation, intimidation and thuggery among the community in the Short Strand, not fear of the PSNI. This is understandable when one considers what has happened not only in Belfast but in other parts of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the motion, the House has rightly declared its dismay and outrage at the appalling events of 30 January last, which culminated in two men being left to bleed unattended on the streets of Belfast, one fatally. The shock initially felt by many people at the cold blooded nature of such an horrific crime has turned to anger at the audacity of those responsible, as they attempted to cover up and deny their actions by intimidating witnesses, threatening their own community and obstructing the police.</P>
      <P>As the McCartney family has made clear to everyone on this island, its members and the partner of Robert McCartney want justice to prevail, as defined by any citizen of the new shared island, established by the Good Friday Agreement &mdash; justice in the courts on this island. They want those directly responsible for Robert McCartney&rsquo;s death, as well as those responsible for the clean-up operation that followed, to face police investigation, prosecution in court and the appropriate custodial sentence for their appalling crime.</P>
      <P>The people of the Short Strand and the Markets have responded to the McCartneys&rsquo; call for justice in a manner befitting the memory of Robert because they knew without question that he was undeserving of such a heinous attack. They also knew that the perpetrators of this <Col N="1472"/>criminal act were not deserving of the usual protection offered to those who present themselves as volunteers of the IRA. The character of these men was well known to the local community, despite the protection they continued to enjoy through their membership of that organisation. The courage, determination, dignity and honesty of the McCartneys have stirred in us all a passionate desire to see their wishes fulfilled and the murderers indicted and convicted.</P>
      <P>The witnesses and evidence necessary for this to happen are readily available. There were reportedly 72 witnesses to this crime, 50 of whom were in the bar at the time. Some, if not many are in a position to offer key evidence against the perpetrators. Some may have been in a position to see what happened outside the premises in question, where the fatal wounds were inflicted. Under different circumstances, a witness to such blatant disregard for human life would have immediately called the authorities and attempted to assist the badly injured men. Co-operation with the police is an automatic response in a normal society.</P>
      <P>However, life for these witnesses is different because they live under the shadow of paramilitaries, who claim status by association with the IRA and enforce that status through menace and violence. Being witness to such a bloody attack, they are under no illusions about what the perpetrators are capable of and would resort to once again to protect their selfish interests. Witnesses were warned that they would act contrary not just to the perpetrators but to the organisation to which they claimed allegiance, the IRA. In such circumstances, only the most direct and convincing statement and actions by Sinn F&eacute;in leaders and the IRA could redress the balance and encourage those witnesses to come forward and co-operate with the police.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated last night and repeated today, the litmus test for Sinn F&eacute;in and the Provisional movement now is in bringing forth the evidence which will mean that those responsible face the full force of the law. Whether that is through the IRA ordering those responsible to turn themselves in or through the IRA unconditionally and in a convincing manner lifting the threats imposed on witnesses to the murder itself, or any other such action, is secondary to the actual result that it produces.</P>
      <P>Evidence that will stand up in court is the key to unmasking these supposed republicans, and it must be allowed to emerge in a manner conducive to the rule of law and justice for the family. The proposal to amend this motion by Sinn F&eacute;in was rejected by this House, as it was in similar circumstances last night by Belfast City Council. Sinn F&eacute;in can point the finger at the PSNI, the courts, the public prosecution service and any other body if it feels that it may help muddy the waters further around this matter, but it will not work. They can direct people to other <Col N="1473"/>sources of authority, such as solicitors, but unless the information is eventually imparted to the police and courts, it will not help the McCartney family find justice.</P>
      <P>As the McCartney family said yesterday, people can go to the Police Ombudsman, a solicitor, or whomever they are comfortable with so long as they are prepared to stand up and give their information in court. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs made clear last night, the Government is not playing politics with policing, seeking somehow to use this case to compromise the Sinn F&eacute;in position on the issue. It will be apparent to many that it is Sinn F&eacute;in that is playing politics with policing in its persistent attempts to avoid the co-operation with the police necessary to bring the killers to justice.</P>
      <P>The challenge facing the leaders of the republican movement is crystal clear. As the Minister pointed out, the double-speak of Sinn F&eacute;in will be tolerated no more. From misleading comments on knife culture to the insidious killing or manslaughter reference by Gerry Adams, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s selfishness has been matched only by its insensitivity. Convincing and effective action on its behalf and on behalf of the Provisional movement is urgently required to bring these killers before the courts. The McCartney family, and the people of Ireland, demand no less.</P>
      <P>Until justice is done, it will be impossible for Robert McCartney&rsquo;s family, partner and children and their friends to mourn his sad passing fully or properly. Let us do all we can to allow them the opportunity to grieve for the terrible loss that they have suffered and give them the justice that they so obviously need to move on. I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to that family that the case will stay on the agenda until it is fully resolved to their satisfaction and that of the people of Ireland, North and South. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We in Fine Gael regret that Sinn F&eacute;in, despite many public announcements about its new attitude to criminality recently, has refused to join the other democratic parties in this House in this motion of solidarity with the McCartney family. Sinn F&eacute;in has again opted to isolate and exclude itself. As I see it, it is but a further expression of the cynical approach evidenced by Sinn F&eacute;in to the murder from the beginning.</P>
      <P>It is utterly dishonest to suggest that there is any comparison between the investigation into the McCartney murder and that into the killing of Se&aacute;n Brown. It is also dishonest of Gerry Adams to speak of being willing to go to court to help represent those personally involved. He knows full well that the criminal justice system does not operate like that. It is dishonest of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in to quote Hugh Orde as saying that people can go to third parties. Of course, he left out the vital words &ldquo;in the first instance&rdquo;. The Deputy saw no point in quoting that in full. That <Col N="1474"/>is what we have been getting from Sinn F&eacute;in regarding this murder from the beginning.</P>
      <P>Everyone in Sinn F&eacute;in, this House and the country knows that the McCartney family is entitled to justice, and if they are to get it, witnesses must come forward to make full statements to the investigating authorities and be prepared to give evidence in court. The authority established by law is the PSNI, the body that can investigate who did what, who saw what, who lifted the video recording from the CCTV camera, who conducted the clean-up, who organised it and who participated. Those are the issues that any police authority in any country in the world deals with when there is a murder, especially a brutal one of this sort. It is not acceptable for Sinn F&eacute;in to come here tonight with pious platitudes about its support for the McCartney family without being prepared to get behind this motion, which is supported by every democratic party in this House. That exposes it, and one questions its approach to this entire affair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Sinn F&eacute;in that key questions were posed during this debate to which no answers have been provided. Why did the former Sinn F&eacute;in Lord Mayor of Belfast attack the SDLP&rsquo;s Alastair McDonnell for saying that IRA men were responsible for the murder? Why did Alex Maskey try to dismiss the murder as &ldquo;knife culture&rdquo;? Why did he rush to condemn police searches &mdash; the PSNI doing its job, as it does in any democratic state &mdash; of suspects&rsquo; houses? Why were there organised riots to disrupt the police searches? Why did the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in tell people on the ground not to go to the PSNI? Why did Gerry Adams wait for two weeks until after the family had spoken out before he found anything to say about the murder? Why have all 12 of those now commonly understood to have been responsible for or involved in this murder not been expelled from the IRA? Why were three selected?</P>
      <P>I will return to the 12 accomplices later. However, at this stage, I would like to focus on the issue that is causing Sinn F&eacute;in such a problem but is the main reason that Fine Gael wanted to have this issue discussed by the House. We want it to support the McCartney family fully, unequivocally and totally, and that is why we have tabled this motion. Let us be in no doubt about it, the McCartney family has done a great service to our nation, not just because of their courage in facing down the Provisional mafia &mdash; that goes without question and they have been complimented by everyone on that &mdash; but the real service that they have rendered to the Irish people is that they have ripped away the hypocrisy, the lies, the subterfuge and falseness of the Provisional movement. They have given courage to countless others to stand up to its thuggery and criminality, and that is what causes it the real <Col N="1475"/>problem. They did this by exposing the pseudo-patriotism, the selfish criminality and the cruel intimidation of the greatest band of thugs ever seen in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Essentially what we see now is the relevance of the stand taken by the McCartney sisters. We are witnessing a turning point in our nation&rsquo;s affairs, and the catalyst for that sea change has been that brave group of women, whom most of us honour tonight. I believe that they are going to the United States, and I wish them God-speed. I hope that they will be recognised in the White House on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day; they are absolutely entitled to that. I am proud to have them there representing all that is decent in the Irish nation. It is important to look back on how this has been handled by the provisional movement in its military and political wings.</P>
      <P>A major comparison is emerging between the double-speak of the provisional movement and the truth as spoken by the McCartney family. We all know the provisional leaders whose spokesmen are past masters of double-speak. They could give university lectures on equivocation and double-talk but all that double-talk has been seen for what it is before the simple truth spoken by the McCartney sisters. It reminds me of the line: &ldquo;Truth is great, it shall prevail; when all is done, the lie shall rot&rdquo;. That is what is happening before our very eyes, and is it not marvellous to see it.</P>
      <P>It is clear at this stage that the brutal murder of Robert McCartney brings Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA to a crossroads. It also highlights the point made by many speakers during this debate that Sinn F&eacute;in has an option. It can use this tragedy to break its links with a military wing and with criminality once and for all because all of us have to face the facts as they are tonight, more than a month after this murder. The killers are still walking the streets of Belfast. It is clear this was a brutal crime carried out by well-known members of the IRA who are responsible for hiding behind smoky mirrors. The IRA expelled three of its members, allegedly as a token of its disgust at republican ideals being betrayed, but there were 12 accomplices. What about the other nine? No answers have been given on that.</P>
      <P>When they were talking about their disgust at the brutal murder of Robert McCartney and the expulsion of three members of the IRA as a consequence, did they give any thought to expelling the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, who was gunned down in cold blood? Did that thought ever occur to them? In so far as they would take any notice of any comments on that, might I suggest to them that they could at this stage give consideration to that?</P>
      <P>What is now clear from all the evidence in the Short Strand is that the self-proclaimed protectors of the people have turned out to be the predators of the people. Essentially, the guard dogs have turned into wolves. What is also clear is that <Col N="1476"/>in confronting this, the McCartney family has provided a formula for the right kind of response to fight these predators. They had the courage to do it and they have spoken up with simple truth and before that simple truth the double-talk falls. It reminds me of the line: &ldquo;Beauty is truth, truth is beauty. That is all I know on earth and all I need to know&rdquo;. That is the simple point that has been demonstrated time and again in the past four or five weeks by the McCartney family.</P>
      <P>What is also clear is that if this matter is to be brought to an end, these killers must be brought to justice and to achieve that Hugh Orde and the Police Service of Northern Ireland will need hard evidence that will stand up in court. The intimidation of witnesses to date has meant that those who want to give evidence, in so far as they do, have received death threats making them stay quiet. The provisional movement has stooped to absolute thuggery warning people not to go to the PSNI because it was IRA business but the IRA had not bargained on the brave stand taken by the McCartney sisters. People are tired of the sham of these IRA pseudo-patriots prancing around like local warlords in the Short Strand and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>What has also emerged recently is evidence of a complex web of IRA criminality uncovered by the law enforcement authorities in this jurisdiction. That makes it clear that the provisional movement is addicted to criminality. There is the evidence of the Northern Bank raid and otherwise in this regard. The Garda investigation into the money laundering operation was so thorough one must wonder at the wisdom of the Government&rsquo;s willingness to ignore such activities in the pursuit of a deal last December. It is clear that the issue of an IRA commitment to ending criminal activity was only introduced into the equation after the talks had broken down, but I am not making any political point on that.</P>
      <P>My real concern is that the huge proceeds of this criminality is to be used, and is being used, to corrupt our democratic process. It is vitally important that all political parties here operate under the same rules and fund-raising constraints. All IRA criminality must be permanently ended if Sinn F&eacute;in is to be accepted as a fully democratic party. Sinn F&eacute;in must use its influence in this regard and in so far as it is unable to deal with any members of the provisional movement and get them to accept that approach, those people must be expelled.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear to those in Sinn F&eacute;in that I want them fully involved in the democratic process here. I suppose in the coming days we will be bombarded with posters of Sinn F&eacute;in and Gerry Adams celebrating Sinn F&eacute;in 100. One would think, particularly in the light of recent events, that the founder of the original genuine Sinn F&eacute;in, Arthur Griffith, would turn in his grave at being associated with this 1969 breakaway group now calling itself Sinn F&eacute;in. In the light of the recent evidence of criminality and the enormous <Col N="1477"/>amount raised by the provisional movement over the past 15 years, now totalling &euro;200 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had a real opportunity through this debate to commend the courage, consistency and honesty of the McCartney family. In regard to the Robert McCartney case the Fine Gael message is simple. We want Sinn F&eacute;in to actively encourage those who witnessed this appalling act to give statements to the investigating police. That is the only effective way of ensuring that prosecutions can be pursued. Sinn F&eacute;in does not have to look too far to find the perpetrators of this crime. Most of them are republican activists. In dealing with Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA, it is also clear that while the scales have been removed from our eyes in recent times regarding the criminality of the provisional movement, we must understand, in terms of Sinn F&eacute;in, that we are dealing with a Marxist-Leninist organisation that has no commitment to the insti<Col N="1478"/>tutions of this State and which has given evidence over time of a dogged determination to overthrow the institutions of this State by one means or another.</P>
      <P>Recent days have shown what can be achieved when pressure is brought to bear on the IRA and the provisional movement. That pressure has been mounted because of the truth, sincerity, honesty and courage of the McCartney sisters. It must be maintained and all of us who are genuine democrats must continue to support the sisters' campaign for truth, honesty and justice to ensure that those who committed this brutal murder are brought to trial and put in jail. The McCartneys deserve no less from the people of Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. The people of Erris, who have been compelled to have the Corrib gas upstream pipeline adjacent to their homes, are scared out of their minds. They have discovered, through the Minister&rsquo;s replies to my parliamentary questions, that no independent quantified risk assessment has been carried out on the Corrib gas upstream pipeline which passes near their homes.</P>
        <P>When I phoned the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I was informed that an independent QRA was carried out by Andrew Johnston on 28 March 2002. When I read the Johnston report, which the Department supplied, I was convinced that it was not a QRA. I subsequently learned from the Minister&rsquo;s replies to my parliamentary questions <Col N="1479"/>and from Shell that the Johnston report is not the QRA and is just a desk study of what the Department is now calling the QRA. The document referred to by the Minister as the QRA was &ldquo;in fact a quantified risk assessment report commissioned by the then named developers in 2001, Enterprise Energy (Ireland) Limited, on the onshore pipeline&rdquo;. The QRA &ldquo;was undertaken by a firm of consultants, J.P. Kenny, on behalf of the developer who himself had worked on the design brief for the pipeline and on which the QRA was based&rdquo;. This is scandalous because J.P. Kenny conducted the QRA on his own work. Where is the independence?</P>
        <P>There is more. To me the old saying, &ldquo;He who pays the piper calls the tune,&rdquo; sets the agenda here. I asked the Minister for Communications, Marine and National Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to make available for public examination the quantified risk assessment report commissioned by Enterprise Energy (Ireland) in 2001 on the Corrib gas pipeline. He replied to my parliamentary question on 1 March 2005: &ldquo;Since the QRA report forms part of the deliberate process under which Shell has sought consent to install and commission the pipeline, it would not be appropriate to release the report at this stage.&rdquo; I do not know exactly what that means except that for some reason the Minister does not want the report released. I had asked the Department and Shell for this report to be released, but this did not happen. Why is it that this report is not being released? Is there something to hide? People believe there must be something to hide when it is not being released. Is there something the people are not supposed to know? Who knows?</P>
        <P>I also asked the Minister in the same parliamentary question, which was answered on 1 March, whether he thought that the Enterprise Energy (Ireland) report was acceptable as an independent QRA since it was commissioned by the industrial promoters of the project, and whether he would consider commissioning an independent QRA in view of the health and safety concerns of the residents in the Erris area. I ask that again because I did not get an answer to it. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for this situation and for the safety of the residents since it is the Department that has given Shell permission to proceed. How can the Department reassure the residents, in the absence of an independent QRA, that everything is all right and that it is safe to live there?</P>
        <P>One local resident who is familiar with fire hydrants says the 10 bar water pressure produced by a fire hydrant would pin a man against a wall at 50 yards. Yet the pipeline is designed for 345 bar pressure and will be 150 bar initially. This man has to live beside the pipeline with his family, and he is very concerned. These are serious concerns. Serious health and safety ques<Col N="1480"/>tions are involved. How can the residents of Erris be reassured? Releasing the QRA for public inspection would be a first valuable step and commissioning an independent QRA would also be essential. Would the Minister of State live beside the pipeline without an independent QRA or where the QRA has been commissioned by developers? I would not. The people need reassurance and answers and are not getting them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am addressing this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in a recent parliamentary question reply to which Deputy Cowley alludes that he does not intend to release the quantitative risk assessment carried out for the onshore pipeline as it now forms part of the deliberative process in connection with the application for consent to install the onshore pipeline which he has received from the developers of the Corrib Gas field. In these circumstances it would not be appropriate for the Minister to release the QRA at present.</P>
        <P>The QRA report carried out on the onshore section of the pipeline addressed and carried out an assessment on the risks present during the operational phase of the onshore section of the pipeline only, that is, the section between the mean low water mark and the first isolation valve upstream of the big trap in the terminal. The purpose of this assessment was to identify and assess all risks associated with the operation of the onshore section of the pipeline.</P>
        <P>The assessment makes recommendations for risk reduction where appropriate and demonstrates that the residual risk associated with the operation of the onshore pipeline have been reduced to tolerable levels. It showed that even in the worst case of the pipeline being ruptured and the gas being ignited, the occupants of a building 70 metres away would be safe. The design of the pipeline means that the risk of such an event or any other type of gas escape is infinitesimally small. The Deputy will be aware that the QRA formed part of the information supplied by the developers to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Fahey, with their application to construct a pipeline. He commissioned an independent assessment on the pipeline design code by Mr. Andrew Johnston, a very reputable petroleum pipeline consultant. Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s study covered design, methodology, operating conditions, pipeline commissioning, public safety, welding and testing, pipeline material and quality and protection from interference.</P>
        <P>Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s report suggested certain updating of the QRA and the developers duly agreed to carry this out. Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s report was entitled Corrib Gas Pipeline Project: Report on Evaluation of the Onshore Pipeline Design Code <Col N="1481"/>and was submitted at the end of March 2002. The report, a copy of which has been provided to Deputy Cowley and many other persons in north-west Mayo, makes a number of recommendations for risk reduction where appropriate. Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s conclusions were as follows. The pipeline design code has been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations and is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions. The design of the onshore pipeline is generally in accordance with code selection and best national and international industry practice, provided that the actions recommended in section 2.2 of his report are followed. The pipeline is considered to be adequately protected from third party interference by burial to a depth of approximately 1.2 m and provision of marker tape above the pipeline. The pipeline is considered to meet public safety requirements as outlined in the selected design code, provided that the actions recommended in section 2.2 are followed. The recommendations of section 2.2 of Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s report have been incorporated in the statutory approvals issued for the Corrib pipeline development.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, his Department is considering an application for consent to install the onshore pipeline. Both the QRA and the Johnston report will form part of this process. In so far as there may be issues in the QRA that need further clarification, elaboration or even additional material, Mr. Johnston will provide the necessary advice for the Department.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>Prior to approval for the production of first gas the Minister will need to be satisfied that condition 3 of his approval of the plan of development has been complied with. This condition states, <i>inter alia</i>, that all production operations regarding Corrib be conducted according to all requirements of the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum production operations. It also requires, prior to commencement of gas production, the receipt of a letter or letters of acceptance for all Corrib installations, pipelines and associated engineering infrastructure from the Minister&rsquo;s auditor indicating that third party independent verification has been carried out and completed satisfactorily on the development.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue this evening. I believe that the NRA is in breach of the regulations in the upgrading of the N5 between Scramoge and Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon. This section of the road carries 4,500 vehicles per day, 20% of which are heavy goods vehicles, HGVs. The NRA guidelines state that the single carriageway width of such a road should be 7.3 m. There should then be a 2.5 m hard shoulder on the edge of the road. There are other specifications regarding junctions and so on. I want to focus on the issue of the hard <Col N="1482"/>shoulder as there is no hard shoulder on this section of road. It has been upgraded but it does not comply with the NRA&rsquo;s guidelines and regulations. There are no verges on the section of road in question.</P>
        <P>The worst section of road is between Strokestown and Tulsk and it is not much better between Tulsk and Ballaghaderreen. The works carried out on the road have caused an increase in speed of traffic and have moved traffic nearer to the entrances of properties and the entrances into adjoining lands. Due to the type of upgrading works that are taking place, there is no room for pedestrians and that is making the road even more dangerous than it was prior to this. As the NRA is not implementing its own road specifications, vehicles are now being moved nearer to homes and other entrances.</P>
        <P>There are stone walls along the boundary of the road. If an animal knocks a stone off the wall at the moment, it will fall on to the middle of the road. That was not the situation prior to the upgrading works taking place as there was a grass margin on the side of the road. Who is liable should a stone end up in the middle of the road? We have not got the type of specification that should be in place.</P>
        <P>At the location of Rath Cruachan national school, the speed limit has been increased from 60 mph to 62 mph thanks to the Department of Transport. The wall outside the school is the only boundary between that and the passing heavy goods vehicles. The door of the school is within a couple of yards of that wall. We need a higher specification for this section of the N5 between Scramoge and Ballaghaderreen. I ask the Minister to ensure that an independent safety audit is carried out. A safety assessment has been carried out, but I want a full safety audit done because the road does not comply with the NRA&rsquo;s specification that it would identify the potential hazards that affect every type of road user, including pedestrians and residents along the road.</P>
        <P>The NRA specification must outline the measures that would either eliminate or mitigate against those hazards, one of which is the introduction of a hard shoulder along the section of road. I want that assessment done independently of the NRA. It is critically important that it is put in place. The Minister for Transport, under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1993, can ensure that it happens.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, I want to see the N5 properly upgraded. We have been told time and again that the road will not be upgraded because of the current and projected traffic volumes. The fact remains that under the NDP, the capital expenditure on infrastructure to date has been &euro;5 billion. The forecast projected by the Government should be &euro;6.25, which means we have underspent considerably in the BMW region. The Government should use this opportunity to upgrade this key element of infrastructure to the west of Ireland. The specifications currently being <Col N="1483"/>implemented by the NRA are increasing the probability of accidents, especially in County Roscommon. I want to see this decision overturned and a proper specification implemented on that section of road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the House for the inability of the Minister for Transport to attend this Adjournment debate. The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authority concerned, in this case Roscommon County Council. The NRA published the specification for road works in 2000 and the NRA design manual for roads and bridges in 2001. The NRA design manual is monitored on an ongoing basis and updated regularly, as required. The specification and design manual are applicable for all new works carried out on the national primary and secondary routes by local authorities.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The works on the N5 in County Roscommon between Scramoge and Ballaghaderreen consisted basically of a pavement rehabilitation project and these works are not subject to the strict design manual for roads and bridges requirements which are reserved for new road schemes on greenfield sites. The works are subject to a safety audit. Over the past four years, extensive works on the N5 between Scramoge and Ballaghaderreen have been carried out. The pavement was in very poor condition and a five-year pavement rehabilitation programme was developed and agreed between the NRA and Roscommon County Council. The works had to be carried out between the fence lines due to the archaeological sensitivity of the area especially in the vicinity of Rathcroghan. The NRA has provided funding for 2005 of the order of &euro;200,000 to advance the N5 strategic corridor study on the Ballaghaderreen to Strokestown route. It is anticipated that the study will be completed by the end of the year. In addition to the works outlined, the 8 km N5 Strokestown to Bumlin Bridge project opened to traffic in 2004 to replace a single carriageway which had a poor alignment and substandard visibility.</P>

T&aacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm go raibh an tAire m&iacute;ch&uacute;ramach san &aacute;bhar seo. I think that the Minister took his eye off the ball, mar a deirtear. Is d&oacute;iche go bhfuil s&eacute; sin ceart, ach t&aacute; br&oacute;n orm gur tharla s&eacute;.</P>
        <P>It is important to clarify the eligibility criteria for the postal vote. People are eligible to apply for and receive a postal vote if they are unable to <Col N="1484"/>leave home or a nursing home to cast their ballots or if they are on the register of electors but are working or studying away from home on the day of an election. Obtaining a postal vote was intended to be a simple matter and it usually is, but in this instance the Minister has made it far more difficult than is necessary.</P>
        <P>While people can apply for a postal vote for up to two days after the order for an election is signed, the intended signing date for the order for the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s election was something of a mystery. I inquired of the Department and the returning officer every day for the past fortnight as to when the order would be signed, but nobody could tell me. N&iacute; raibh fhios ag aon duine. Quite suddenly on Friday afternoon, the order was signed. I assumed that as it was signed on a Friday, people would have two working days and would still be eligible to apply for a postal vote until Tuesday. The returning officer told me that as the Act refers to &ldquo;two days&rdquo;, Saturday and Monday were counted, leaving out Sunday.</P>
        <P>The approach is not in line with the spirit of the Act. It should have been possible to apply for a postal vote for two working days after the order was signed. I cannot understand why the Minister was so secretive about signing the order or why he signed it on a Friday. Why did he not sign it on a Monday? If he had, there would be no confusion about whether Saturday was a working day. The Fine Gael Party has three candidates for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the Galway electoral area. I told them that while I did not know on what date the order would be signed, they would have two working days from the date to lodge the last of their postal vote applications. One of the candidates went with a bundle of applications to apply on Tuesday but was denied the opportunity to obtain postal votes for his constituents. The Minister&rsquo;s party has six candidates in the area. I do not know if they were aware of when the order would be signed, but I certainly could not find out in advance.</P>
        <P>Apart from the fact that my party has been left at a severe disadvantage, an issue of fairness is involved. People who cannot attend a polling booth on election day for whatever reason should be facilitated, but on this occasion it was made difficult for them to obtain a postal vote. Last week, the Minister introduced 35 pages of regulations to govern the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta election and denied those of us with an interest in the matter the opportunity to debate them in the House. I might have been able to draw to his attention during a debate the difficulty that would arise in the context of postal votes. I would certainly have warned him to avoid signing the order on a Friday afternoon as he might count Saturday and place people at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a great deal for which to answer to the disadvantaged, disenfranchised &Uacute;dar&aacute;s electorate. Fine Gael has been put at a severe disadvantage also.</P>

        <P>T&aacute; iontas orm faoin gcaoi a bhfuil an Teachta ag l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il na ceiste seo. An tseachtain seo caite, ghlaoigh an Teachta ar an oifig eolais, agus d&rsquo;iarr s&eacute; c&oacute;ip de na rialach&aacute;in. Glaodh orm agus d&rsquo;ordaigh m&eacute; ar an bpointe go dtabharfa&iacute; na rialach&aacute;in sin d&oacute;, mar is maith liom bheith oscailte sa m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute;.</P>
        <P>Chomh maith leis sin, m&aacute; sheice&aacute;lann an Teachta, gheobhaidh s&eacute; amach cad a tharla, n&oacute; bh&iacute; m&eacute; sa Roinn sna Forbacha D&eacute; hAoine. Th&aacute;inig oifigigh de chuid na Roinne chugam, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag cur i leith oifigigh na Roinne go raibh siad ar aon bhealach ag gn&iacute;omh&uacute; go polaiti&uacute;il. D&rsquo;iarr siad orm an t-ord&uacute; a sh&iacute;ne&aacute;il mar rinne siad an c&aacute;s go raibh daoine ag iarraidh go s&iacute;neofa&iacute;&eacute; le go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s na f&oacute;gra&iacute; a chur sna nuacht&aacute;in &aacute;iti&uacute;la. N&iacute; raibh a fhios ag &eacute;inne i bhFianna F&aacute;il c&eacute;n uair a sh&iacute;neofa&iacute;&eacute;, agus d&eacute;anaim an iarraidh seo leis an Teachta. Bh&iacute; seisean n&iacute; ba mh&oacute; ar an eolas faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; v&oacute;tanna poist n&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in. Go deimhin f&eacute;in, mar a thuigfeadh s&eacute; f&eacute;in, n&iacute;l s&eacute; sna rialach&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I wish to clarify that matters relating to the electoral register and supplements to the register do not fall under my remit as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I propose in my reply to outline the facts about the register of electors before moving on to outline my role in the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta election.</P>
        <P>The register of electors is provided for under section 13 of the Electoral Act 1992 and forms part of the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. Specific responsibility for compilation and publication of the electoral register rests with local authorities. A new register is compiled each year, published in draft form on 1 November and made available for inspection at several places including the offices of a county councillor or county registrar, public libraries, post offices and Garda stations. Amendments to the register can be made until 25 November. An amended register is published in February of the following year. A person who is qualified to vote but has missed the deadline to include his or her name on the register can apply to be included in a supplement to the register. This will enable him or her to vote at any election or referendum held during the year provided the relevant application has been made at least 13 days, excluding Sundays and bank holidays, before polling day.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred in particular to the list of postal voters which, with the list of special voters, constitutes a supplement to the register of electors. While it is the norm during an election to vote in person at an official voting centre, a person may be eligible for a postal vote if, for example, he or she is a member of the Defence <Col N="1486"/>Forces, a member of the Garda or an Irish diplomat posted abroad or his or her spouse. Persons who suffer from a physical illness or disability or who are studying full time at an educational institution away from the home address at which they are registered to vote may also be eligible for inclusion on the list of postal voters.</P>
        <P>Applications for inclusion on the electoral register, including the postal voters list, must be completed by 25 November each year. Application forms are readily available at county councils, corporations, post offices and public libraries nationally. The statutory deadline for giving effect to applications to have names entered in the supplement to the postal voters list is set out in section 15(<i>a</i>)(<i>iv</i>) of the Electoral Act 1992, as inserted by section 7(<i>c</i>) of the Electoral Amendment Act 2001. It states: &ldquo;An application by an elector to have his name entered into the supplement to the postal voters list received by the registration authority on or after the third day after the dissolution of the D&aacute;il at a general election or on or after the third day after the date of the making of the order appointing polling day at a D&aacute;il by-election or a presidential, European or local election or an election to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or a referendum shall not have effect in relation to that election or referendum.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Under section 28 of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act 1979, as amended by section 1 of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta (Amendment) Act 1999, elections to an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall be held as may be prescribed by regulations made by me as Minister. Section 31 of the 1979 Act sets out that persons are entitled to vote on the basis of qualifying to vote in a local election in a Gaeltacht constituency. The generality of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s regulations which I have prescribed follow the regulations agreed for the local election code. The rules pertaining to the register of electors, which are outside my remit, also apply.</P>
        <P>I signed an t&Oacute;rd&uacute; um &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta (An L&aacute; V&oacute;ta&iacute;ochta) 2005 last Friday, 25 February 2005. Applications to the registration authority to have names entered on the postal voters list therefore could be accepted until close of business on the following Monday, 28 February. The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s elections regulations require that statutory notice of 28 days be given of any election and in the case of the election announced for 2 April 2005, this means before Saturday, 4 March. To publish the statutory notice in the regional newspaper network it was necessary for me to sign sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>It was deemed important to reach the local media on this occasion in light of significant changes to the nomination procedures, namely, that the former system of deposits no longer applies but nominations must instead be supported by a certificate of political affiliation or assented to by 15 members of the relevant constituency. While the changes are significant in terms of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s election, last run in 1999, <Col N="1487"/>they do not consist of anything new in terms of the existing local election code.</P>

	<P>Applications for entry in that register were sought publicly in November and incorporated in the official register of electors published on 1 February 2005. It was open to persons to apply at any time between that date and prior to 1 March for inclusion to the supplement to the postal voters list which will apply to the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s election on 2 April 2005.</P>
        <P>Advance notice was given of my intention to hold the next &Uacute;dar&aacute;s election in April 2005 as far back as 8 July 2004 in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 345 to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh. It was also highlighted in my press release of 7 January 2005 relating to the review of powers and functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.</P>
        <P>I chose a Saturday for the poll to facilitate persons who work or study away from home during the week, and this will once again prove successful.

      <sTitle>Child Care Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue this evening. Unfortunately, it is not the first time I have pursued the matter in this House, which refers to the proposed removal of staffing grants from certain child care facilities in County Kerry from next September, under the equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP.</P>
        <P>In recent months many community based, not-for-profit, child care centres and services in County Kerry and elsewhere received letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform stating that a review was being initiated which would, in effect, result in the loss of staffing grants from next September.</P>
        <P>These grants are used for staff wages and costs and are a vital source of income for child care <Col N="1488"/>centres and cr&egrave;ches. They are usually paid for a period of three years to allow a facility to become financially sustainable. The departmental review proposes that after September next only groups in very disadvantaged areas will receive staffing grants.</P>
        <P>The letter asks child care facilities to review their services and their fee structures so that, where possible, they may become sustainable from 1 September 2005 through a fair and equitable fee structure. In other words, if one does not fall into the &ldquo;very disadvantaged&rdquo; category, one has until 1 September to become financially sustainable by pushing up fees. The Department will take away the staffing grants, and child care facilities must increase their fees to make up the shortfall.</P>
        <P>This is a simple cutback and an attempt to starve child care services in County Kerry and elsewhere of funding. It is an attempt to force child care services to increase their fees and to make child care less affordable to families and lone parents.</P>
        <P>I raised the matter regarding the situation at the T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g child care service in Ballydesmond, on the Cork-Kerry border, which is experiencing funding difficulties. I recently received representations from South Kerry Development Partnership on this same issue. The child care co-ordinator there informs me that this threat to staffing grants has caused untold worry and confusion in pre-school, cr&egrave;che and child care facilities in County Kerry.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting of community child care groups in Kerry, concerns were expressed about the plan to remove staffing grants. It has been reported to me that standards cannot be maintained in these facilities if EOCP funding is in jeopardy. Child care committees are reaching burn-out and are already finding it difficult to get new staff. According to local child care centres, the removal of staffing grants would result in reduced places for children, further increases in fees, reduced opening hours, staff redundancies and the closure of some services.</P>
        <P>Will the Government sit back and ignore such warnings from those who work at the coalface of the child care sector? What does the Government mean by &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo;? It is a very woolly statement. There is disadvantage in every area. It could apply to rural or financial disadvantage. The Minister should outline what he means. Such talk of disadvantage is merely a cover-up for this cutback. My party leader, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, raised the matter this morning, and it was rich to hear the Taoiseach say the Government is giving the money through child benefit. Child care facility funding was not meant to come under child benefit.</P>
        <P>The child care co-ordinator in Kerry has rightly pointed out that these changes, if introduced, will have two major consequences. The most vulnerable families in the community will lose out, especially in rural and isolated areas, which are <Col N="1489"/>disadvantaged areas. Unemployment will increase because parents will not be able to avail of affordable child care when in training or education. They will have to stay at home and care for their children when their local cr&egrave;che increases its fees as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
        <P>There is disillusionment among child care workers at this decision. They are being placed in a financial straitjacket by this so-called review of staffing grants. Many cr&egrave;ches and child care centres will be unsustainable and will have to close their doors.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister came in for the Adjournment debate. He should not pursue this review and should assure child care facilities around the country that staffing grants will not be removed and that he will allow such facilities to maintain and enhance their existing level of services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin for affording me the opportunity to update the House again on this issue. I understand that the matter was also raised on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>The equal opportunities child care programme is the Government&rsquo;s key response to the need to develop child care to help to support the needs of parents, with a particular emphasis on those who may be in employment, education or training to prepare for employment. The programme for Government and the progress of the equal opportunities child care programme represent confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda. The EOCP has both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion perspective and aims, among other things, to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55% by the programme&rsquo;s end. The broad objectives of the EOCP are to improve the quality of child care, to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities and places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 was held within a month of the Government changeover in 1997. I have to say, without any element of rancour, that all the evidence shows that, unlike the case of the previous Government, child care has been high on the agenda of the present Government since that time. The Government has moved consistently, promptly and purposefully to facilitate the development of a top quality child care programme throughout the country. The achievements in child care are a testament to that commitment and have helped in no small way to support the child care needs of parents in employment, education and training as well as helping many parents to break the cycle of disadvantage. Since it was launched in 2000, the total funding package for the 2000 to 2006 <Col N="1490"/>phase of the EOCP has increased from &euro;317 million to &euro;499.3 million, or by 57%, the most recent increase being &euro;50 million in additional capital in the budget for 2005. I am grateful to my Government colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for making that possible.</P>
        <P>I contrast that, however, with the sad state of assistance in this area under the previous Government. I can only describe it as very sad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the past. The Minister should not go back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Some people have a brass neck to raise these issues when in those days nothing was done. Since budget day last December, I have already made one significant announcement of over &euro;25 million in additional capital funding and I expect to make another such announcement in the near future. The programme has already created more than 20,000 new child care places and a further 16,000 have been commissioned using EOCP funding. The programme has exceeded our expectations in terms of achievement. The programme also includes a measure which offers grant assistance towards the staffing costs of community-based child care services which offer child care services to disadvantaged parents who may be in employment, education or training. More than 775 community based, not-for-profit projects receive ongoing staffing grant assistance and about &euro;30 million of EU and Exchequer funding goes towards this measure each year.</P>
        <P>It was originally envisaged that some groups would receive such funding for a period of three years as they moved towards sustainability, which is normally achievable if the groups are operating at full capacity and with a level of fees which enables them to break even. Some of the children who go to these centres are disadvantaged while other parents are in a position to pay the full commercial rate for the child care they receive. Other groups, particularly in very disadvantaged areas, are likely to offer services to a client group who are unable to meet the economic fee structure and these services will, therefore, require ongoing staffing grant support to ensure that they can continue to support the child care needs of their disadvantaged client group. This is particularly important in assisting families to break the cycle of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin will be aware that levels of staffing grant assistance have been maintained and guaranteed at existing levels until 31 August 2005 for all groups, regardless of circumstances, whose first three-year funding had elapsed, unless the level of service being offered has declined significantly below that which they had originally undertaken to deliver.</P>
        <P>My Department is examining a wide range of options to ensure that staffing grant assistance is provided on an ongoing basis and in a fair and equitable manner for those services which cannot support themselves with a fair, equitable and <Col N="1491"/>economic fee structure due to the level of disadvantage of their client groups. Every service, especially those in Kerry about which the Deputy is concerned, will be given an opportunity to present its case before any change is made to funding levels. I hope to be able to increase the level of funding for those services which are at the bottom of the scale &mdash; the most disadvantaged. We hope to be in a position to take firm decisions on future arrangements in the near future and as soon as we do, we will advise all groups accordingly. Every Deputy will agree with me that it is in the interests of society to ensure that the ongoing financial supports which are made available under the equal opportunities child care programme specifically target those who experience the greatest disadvantage in society.</P>
        <P>It is also noteworthy &mdash; again I emphasise this by way of contrast to what happened before this Government took office &mdash; that the Government has increased child benefit by 272% since 1997. This is the uncaring Government which the left has castigated for many things, according to what we read in the newspapers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit has increased by 272% since 1997. It has risen in real terms from a minimum of &euro;54 per child per month in 2000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to over &euro;141 per child per month this year. This payment, made every month for every child aged under 18 years who is still at school, affords considerable additional financial support to parents above what was available in 1997 and gives all parents options concerning the child care arrangements they consider suitable for their family.</P>
        <P>It is only fair to emphasise that the EOCP has been central to the development of child care over the last five years. We all recognise that the child care sector has flourished over the past seven or eight years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It will continue to do so under the careful stewardship of this Government which has recognised, for the first time, the need to foster the sector and which has provided significant funding, both directly and indirectly, to support that growth. The range of supports available under the EOCP and in the broader range of Government actions to support the child care sector is a testament to its commitment &mdash; and a contrast to the performance of the previous Government &mdash; to support parents in meeting their child care and employment needs for the economic and social betterment of our country.</P>

	<P>The Food Agency Co-operation Council was established in 2000 under the aegis of my Department to promote the fullest practical co-operation between the State agencies involved in the food industry in the interests of the optimum development of the industry. The council has an independent chairman, Mr. Padraic White.</P>
        <P>The inaugural meeting of the council took place in March 2000 and it has met on 20 occasions since its inception. The last meeting took place in October 2003. It did not meet in 2004 as a number of factors contributed to the difficulties in rescheduling meetings that year. My Department will shortly meet the council&rsquo;s chairman on a possible future work programme having regard to the Enterprise Strategy Report and the 2015 Agri-Vision report.</P>
        <P>The council has played a significant role in increasing co-operation, at formal and informal level, between the State agencies involved in the food industry and has led to a number of memorandums of understandings being agreed between agencies. The council has also produced a number of publications which have been well received by the industry. In 2001 the council was instrumental in the drawing up of an agreed human resource development programme for the food processing industry and also produced the publication Market Trends &mdash; Implications for Suppliers and State Agency Initiatives. In December 2002, the council&rsquo;s publication A National Food Incident Management Plan was launched. The Market Led New Product Development Guide, launched in April 2003, provides guidance to food and drink companies in relation to new product development best practice.</P>

	<P>An interdepartmental-interagency working group was established within my Department in October 2003 to develop proposals for a national strategy and best practices to ensure the co-existence of GM crops with conventional and organic farming. Part of the group&rsquo;s work programme has been to examine the economic implications of such farming practices.</P>
        <P>Preliminary research completed by Teagasc indicates that the cultivation of certain crops with certain modifications may provide a financial incentive to the Irish farmer. While strands of this research parallel recently completed work in other countries it does not specifically address the predicted costs of co-existence to the Irish farmer.</P>
        <P>The general conclusion of recent Danish and UK research on the economic impact of co-existence on farm profitability is that the costs of complying with the required thresholds for crops of maize, potatoes, cereals, oilseed rape and sugar beet vary from zero to 9% above the costs of growing conventional crops. However, it should be noted that costs described were based on estimates.</P>
        <P>In order to establish greater clarity in the matter, as far as Irish conditions are concerned, I have asked Teagasc to explore the possibility of carrying out an evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the agri-food industry of the possible use of GMOs in crop and livestock production.</P>
        <P>In relation to tracing a consignment, EU legislation which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2003 requires that all GM products, including animal feed, be properly labelled and accompanied by the appropriate documentation to facilitate full traceability.</P>

	<P>Ireland exported some 130,000 live cattle last year to various destinations in Europe and also to Lebanon, compared to 220,000 in 2003. The principal destinations in Europe were Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. The reduced numbers in 2004 can be attributed to buoyant prices for cattle on the home market and a strong export market in beef. In addition, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced internal EU marketplace.</P><Col N="1495"/>
        <P>My Department, together with An Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs, continues to seek to exploit every opportunity to expand the market for the live trade and beef exports. As a result of these efforts, an agreement was made to open the Libyan market for live animals. Logistical problems have so far prevented the development of this market and it remains closed. Another traditional third country market for Irish cattle in the past, which is currently closed to live exports, is Egypt, though the market there is open to Irish beef imports. Ongoing contact is maintained with the Egyptian authorities in relation to trade, both in meat and live cattle.</P>
        <P>The live trade is a critical component to overall competition in the beef trade. It is my policy that there should be free and open access to all markets, both within the EU and in third countries for Irish beef and live cattle. I am fully committed to ensuring that the option of exporting cattle live to overseas countries is maintained.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme my Department&rsquo;s Dublin headquarters will be transferred to Portlaoise; my Department&rsquo;s laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom and my Department&rsquo;s local offices in Cork city and Mallow will move to Fermoy.</P>
        <P>Last November, the Decentralisation Implementation Group published its report to the Minister for Finance identifying the organisations to move in the first phase of the decentralisation programme and included the decentralisation of 392 Department of Agriculture and Food staff from Dublin to Portlaoise. A further report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group is expected in spring 2005 to deal with locations not covered in last November&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>Following the Government&rsquo;s announcement in budget 2004, my Department established a Decentralisation Implementation Committee, chaired by an assistant secretary general, to plan and control the process. Tangible progress has been made on the decentralisation of my Department to Portlaoise already, with some 50 staff having been assigned there in July 2004.</P>
        <P>In accordance with recommendations made in the Decentralisation Implementation Group report of November 2004, my Department submitted a revised implementation plan to the Decentralisation Implementation Group on 14 February 2005 which sets out the sequence and proposed timescale in which work areas of my Department will be moved to Portlaoise. It is intended that the work of the area aid section <Col N="1496"/>involving over 60 positions will be moved from Dublin to Portlaoise beginning in April 2005. A further 50 staff will be relocated to Portlaoise towards the end of 2005. It is planned to proceed with this phased approach to the decentralisation process during 2006 and 2007. The largest tranche of work-staff will be decentralised in 2008.</P>
        <P>As also requested in the Decentralisation Implementation Group report of November 2004, a separate implementation plan in relation to information and communication technology staff will be forwarded by 31 March 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the OPW to have a suitable permanent headquarters built in Portlaoise. In the meantime, temporary accommodation is being secured in Portlaoise to cater for staff who will be working there in advance of the building of the permanent headquarters for my Department. My Department is also liaising with the OPW on the acquisition of suitable sites in Fermoy and Macroom.</P>

Ireland submitted an action programme for further implementation of the directive to the European Commission on 22 <Col N="1497"/>October 2004. The Commission conveyed its view, by way of a letter of formal notice under Article 228 of the EU Treaty issued to Ireland dated 22 December 2004, that the action programme is not complete and does not comply with the requirements of the directive and the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland delivered on 11 March 2004.</P>

	<P>The 2004 Enterprise Strategy Group Report to the T&aacute;naiste entitled &ldquo;Ahead of the Curve&rdquo; focused on marketing as one of two development axes, the other being technology. Promotion and marketing are becoming ever more critical as Irish agriculture enters a period of great change with future production decisions becoming more market-led and influenced by decoupling policy under the Luxembourg Agreement, EU enlargement and a new WTO round. A clearly focused strategic marketing and promotion policy is essential to assist the food industry here in exploiting market opportunities.</P>
        <P>An Bord Bia plays a leading role in supporting the food industry in the development and consolidation of export markets. It is widely acknowledged as doing a very effective job and its success in promoting Ireland as a food island is evidenced by the record results for 2004, when the value of food export crossed the &euro;7 billion mark for the first time.</P>
        <P>In the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004, public expenditure of &euro;28.69 million was allocated to fund the food marketing and promotion measure of the national development plan. The measure is administered by Bord Bia and covers grant assistance to companies to <Col N="1498"/>improve their individual marketing capabilities and the board&rsquo;s generic market development activities. These activities include marketing promotion and advertising, market research studies and information-publications, development of marketing skills, quality and training.</P>
        <P>The organisation is currently undertaking an independent strategic review of its future direction. I believe that this review will enable Bord Bia to remain focused on its mission, which in turn will help secure a diverse, competitive and export orientated food industry.</P>

	<P>Low levels of land mobility have been <Col N="1499"/>a long-term feature of Irish farming and the substantial increase in land prices in recent years and the relatively small acreage of land that is placed on the market annually have not helped the situation. Since 1997 agricultural land prices have more than doubled reflecting a combination of a shortage of land on the market and increasing levels of demand from agricultural and non-agricultural buyers. According to the Central Statistics Office, in recent years less that 0.2% of agricultural land has been placed on the open market for sale. The major means by which land has changed ownership in recent years has been through inheritance, generally within families.</P>
        <P>The cost of purchasing land has encouraged many farmers who wish to expand their enterprises or enter agriculture to opt for leased land. Almost one fifth of all agricultural land is leased with one third of farms leasing-in some portion of land.</P>
        <P>For meaningful farm planning, leasing is best done on a long-term basis, and the Government has a number of incentives in place to encourage this trend and to improve the overall levels of land mobility. To this end, my Department operates an early retirement pension for retiring farmers who dispose of land either by sale, transfer or long-term lease.</P>
        <P>There are generous income tax disregards for farmers who lease out land on a long-term basis. At present lessors aged over 40 years of age can avail of annual exemption thresholds of up to &euro;7,500 for leases of five to seven years and up to &euro;10,000 for leases of ten years or more. This has undoubtedly encouraged the better utilisation of land and facilitates better long-term planning by farmers who wish to increase their scale of production at a reasonable cost without having to purchase.</P>
        <P>There are also a series of measures in place to help reduce start-up costs for new entrants. These include a number of generous grants and tax reliefs. For young, suitably trained farmers there is a number of attractive schemes including an installation aid grant of &euro;9,520, 100% stamp duty relief on land, a 90% relief from capital acquisition tax, CAT, and 100% stock relief for four years for eligible farmers.</P>

	<P>The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 reached at the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 26 June 2003 provided <Col N="1500"/>a financial envelope to each member state. This envelope represents the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid in the member state during the three-year reference period 2000-02 calculated at 2002 rates of payment. The outcome of the agreement, which will reshape the Common Agriculture Policy and secure its future in making it more relevant to modern society and more defensible in a WTO context, was a balanced one which addressed Ireland&rsquo;s principal objectives. Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances.</P>
        <P>Index linking of the single payment scheme was not an element of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. There was, however, a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as degression, to meet future financing needs. I believe one of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal. The removal of this particular provision meant a saving of some &euro;420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.</P>

	<P>I want to inform the Deputy that there were two separate incidences, in the four week period from 18 October to 11 November 2004, in which traces of terrestrial animal bone were found in samples of the imported feed material. The affected feed material and associated compound feed was subsequently impounded, recalled, where necessary, and detained by my Department.</P>
        <P>The first incident refers to two consignments of sugar beet pulp, totalling around 4,160 tonnes, which were imported into Dundalk Port from Germany, via Holland, on 18 and 22 October last year. Testing carried out by the control authorities in other member states discovered similar problems with imports of this material. Following a request to do so, the importer has recently submitted a proposal to my Department for disposal of the contaminated material. Officials of my Department have examined and accepted the proposal, which involves dispatch to Holland and destruction by means of incineration at a power generation plant in that country. The transfer of the material out of this country, which is likely to happen in the next couple of weeks, will be under the supervision of officials of my Department.</P><Col N="1501"/>
        <P>The second incident refers to a consignment of maize gluten, totalling approximately 6,515 tonnes, imported from the USA and part discharged at Foynes on 9 November and part in Ringaskiddy on 11 November.

The importer has challenged the Department&rsquo;s right to impound the material by way of a judicial review, the outcome of which is expected shortly.</P>

	<P>As part of the preparations for the new single payment scheme my Department has prepared a consultative document on cross-compliance and has made it available to interested organisations. This document takes account of the requirements laid down in the EU regulations on cross compliance and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s proposed approach to the obligations that should be respected by farmers receiving direct payments under the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>Under cross-compliance requirements any farmer receiving direct payments must respect the various statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation &mdash; directives and regulations &mdash; on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health and must maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.</P>
        <P>It will be necessary to carry out on-farm visits to ensure that farmers respect cross-compliance requirements. In general the rate of inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the relevant statutory management requirements or good agricultural and environmental conditions apply. However, at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the animal identification and registration requirements of cross-compliance as this is the level prescribed under the relevant regulations.</P>
        <P>Where breaches of cross-compliance provisions are detected the level of penalty to be applied will be determined on the basis of an assessment of the importance of the non-compliance set out in the control report following the on-farm inspection. If the non-compliance is due to negligence then, normally, the penalty is 3% of the aid for the year in question. However taking account of the permanence, extent or severity of the non-compliance, the 3% penalty may be reduced to 1% or increased to 5%. If repeated non-compliance is found then the penalty established will be multiplied by three up to a maximum of 15% of the aid. If intentional non-compliance is found then the penalty is 20% of the direct payments referred to under Council Regulation 1782/93 for the year in question. However, on examination of the control report and taking account of the <Col N="1502"/>permanence, extent or severity of the non-compliance, the 20% may be reduced to 15% or increased to 100%. Most of the statutory management requirements have been in place for some years and generally farmers are aware of the various requirements.</P>
        <P>In the light of submissions which my Department has received in response to its consultative document and following consultations with interested bodies, my Department will shortly publish a detailed information booklet on cross-compliance requirements for the assistance of applicants under the single payment scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department is finalising a package of amendments to the national control regime for veterinary medicines. One of the key objectives of these amendments is to put in place a regime which will address a number of difficulties identified arising from inflexibilities in the existing regime.</P>
        <P>I propose to make the prescription regime more effective and workable by removing the mandatory requirement for veterinary practitioners to clinically examine an animal at the time of each prescription and also by extending the range of outlets which may supply medicines on foot of a veterinary prescription to include the licensed merchant category.</P>
        <P>While I am very conscious of the need to minimise the cost of these measures to farmers, the primary focus of the medicine control regime is to protect public health and animal health and welfare. I am satisfied that the changes I propose to make to the medicines legislation will improve the operation of the prescription regime and will provide a basis for a greater degree of price competition in the supply of veterinary medicines to farmers, while retaining the necessary safeguards in relation to public health and animal health and welfare.</P>

	<P>My Department has been aware, from an early stage in the negotiations on the single payment scheme, that it had potential implications for farmers who had joined one or other of the early retirement schemes. Those issues were repeatedly raised by Ireland in the course of the negotiations, and we secured agreement on certain measures to address them.</P>
        <P>In general, the new single payment scheme introduced in Ireland from 1 January 2005 is <Col N="1504"/>applicable to farmers who actively farmed during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid livestock premia and-or arable aid in one or more of those years and who will continue to farm in 2005.</P>
        <P>Farmers who joined the 1994 early retirement scheme, which closed to new applications in December 1999, did not farm during the reference period and cannot establish entitlements under the single payment scheme. Where they transferred their holdings by lease, it was the transferees who were actively farming during the reference years and it is they who will have entitlements established for them. Entitlements are attached to the farmer who was actively farming during the reference period, not to the land.</P>
        <P>During the course of negotiations with the European Commission on the single payment scheme, Ireland secured agreement to an arrangement that will benefit family members or others who now take over holdings that were farmed by third parties who had leased them during the reference period. Farmers who take over such holdings, by transfer free of charge or by a lease of five or more years at a nominal amount, could apply to the national reserve for payment entitlements under the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>Participants in the current early retirement scheme launched in November 2000, who farmed during part or all of the reference period, will have entitlements in their own right and can, before 15 May 2005, use the private contract clause to lease these entitlements to the young farmer who holds the lease of their land under the early retirement scheme. In such circumstances, the retired farmer must establish the entitlements in 2005 on a special form provided by the Department. The qualifying young farmer may or may not have entitlements and land in his-her own right.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland submitted an action programme for further implementation of the directive to the European Commission on 22 October 2004. In parallel with the submission of the action programme, Ireland also submitted a derogation proposal on 11 November 2004 setting out a scientific justification for operating levels of up to 250 kg organic nitrogen per hectare, based on the specific characteristics of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The Commission has conveyed its view, by way of a letter of formal notice under Article 228 of <Col N="1505"/>the EU Treaty issued to Ireland dated 22 December 2004, that the action programme is not complete and does not comply with the requirements of the directive and the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland delivered on 11 March 2004. My Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of a response.</P>
        <P>The Commission has indicated that the derogation application will not be considered until the action programme has been agreed.</P>

	<P>I led a delegation of food and drink industry representatives to China as part of a wider trade mission led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, from 17 to 22 January 2005. I accompanied the Taoiseach at formal state functions, including a meeting with the Chinese Premier, Mr Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao. I also held talks with the Chinese Vice Minister of Agriculture and with the Minister for the Administration of Quality, Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, AQSIQ, who is responsible for imports into China.</P>
        <P>In the course of my visit I signed a pigmeat protocol with AQSIQ Minister Li Changjiang that will form the basis on which pigmeat products from Ireland will be exported to China. The protocol was signed in the presence of the Taoiseach and Premier Wen Jiabao of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China in the Great Hall of the People following official talks held between Ireland and China. This formal agreement has been concluded after intensive negotiations and will provide a framework within which actual trade in pigmeat products could commence later in the year.</P>
        <P>I raised the question of the lifting of the Chinese ban on beef products in my official discussions with both the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for AQSIQ. During these discussions I emphasised that the control and supervision of food safety is afforded the very highest status in Ireland and that the Government is committed to protecting the high quality of food pro<Col N="1506"/>duction and the preservation of our status as a supplier of the highest quality products to international buyers.</P>
        <P>I also addressed seminars in Beijing and Shanghai organised by my Department and An Bord Bia. These seminars were aimed at promoting Irish food and drinks in the Chinese market, providing assurance on the safety controls related to food production and details on the country&rsquo;s export capability. The seminars also provided an opportunity for the Department, An Bord Bia and industry representatives to directly engage with ministry, regulatory officials and Chinese importers and traders.</P>
        <P>While there I also met with representatives of BIM and their Chinese contacts to promote and develop further opportunities for the export of fish products to China.</P>
        <P>The trade mission included some 25 representatives of Irish food and drinks companies and I am confident that contacts established with Chinese trading companies during the visit will build on the good relations between the two states. China is a huge market with enormous potential which could be hugely beneficial to Ireland in the food and drinks sectors. I am confident that the mission has laid solid grounds for maximising this potential and has established a basis for further contacts at official and industry level which should lead in the future to increased trade between Ireland and China.</P>

        <Quest>the number of cases of BSE in cattle discovered in 2004 and to date in 2005; the way in which this compares with recent years; the number of such cases which were discovered in animals born after the imposition of the ban on meat and bonemeal; if she has information regarding the reason so many cases in such animals are still being discovered; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004, 126 cases of BSE were confirmed compared with 182 in 2003 and 333 in 2002. There have been ten cases to date in 2005 which represents a decrease of 73% on the number of cases, some 37, discovered in the same period in 2004. The vast majority of these cases were in animals born prior to the introduction here of the additional controls in 1996 and 1997. The shift in age profile in BSE cases as well as a reduction in case numbers indicates that the additional controls have been effective in significantly reducing the exposure of animals born after 1997 to the infectious agent. It is expected that the incidence of disease will continue to decline as cows born prior to 1998 leave the system.</P>
        <P>Investigations are carried out into the feeding regimes of all herds in which BSE is identified and, in particular, in herds in which cases born <Col N="1507"/>after the feed controls were reinforced are confirmed.</P>
        <P>Within the context of the overall picture, the diagnosis of BSE in a small number of animals born after 1997 was to be expected. To date, nine animals born after 1997 &mdash; four in 1998 and five in 1999 &mdash; have been diagnosed with BSE. In addition, ten cases were confirmed in 1997 born animals but some of these were born before all the reinforced measures were fully in place. My Department had foreseen the likelihood that individual cases would from time to time arise which may relate to circumstances specific to the farms in question and which do not conform with the general trend as the incidence of the disease in the national herd recedes. There is, however, no basis for suspecting that these cases are indicative of either a systemic failure in controls or of a reversal of or deviation from the overall positive trend in relation to BSE in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet nor is there a quota at farm level. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specified tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.</P>
        <P>The question of ownership of the sugar quota has never been an issue in the past because the EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. However, the status of the quota has become the subject of debate since the Commission raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility in the context of the proposed reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, are strongly opposed to the idea of quota mobility but if it is maintained in the Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposals, due to be published around June, then the Commission will propose appropriate rules to deal with the new situation. I have sought the advice of the Attorney General in that context but my objective will be to ensure that the <i>status quo</i> is maintained and that cross-border mobility of quota is not allowed.</P>
        <P>The decision by Greencore to close its plant in Carlow and to consolidate all of its sugar manufacturing in Mallow was a commercial decision taken by the board on 12 January 2005. The decision was taken by the company in the light of the increasing competition in the sugar market and taking account of the reality that changes will occur in the industry as a consequence of the reform of the EU sugar regime and of WTO developments. The company advised my Department two days in advance of the board meeting that a proposal concerning the future of its two processing plants and involving the likely closure of the Carlow plant would be put to the board for decision.</P>

	<P>The framework agreement for the next WTO round which was concluded in Geneva in August 2004 commits member countries to agree detailed rules, including an end date, for the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsides and for the introduction of disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect. This agreement covers export refunds, export credits, the trade-distorting practices of state trading enterprises and food aid not in conformity with disciplines to be introduced. This approach should ensure equal competition on the world market for all exporters. The full details of the implementation of the framework agreement are the subject of ongoing negotiations in Geneva, leading to a WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005.</P>

	<P>Participants in the scheme of early retirement from farming introduced in 1994 under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92 were required to have their holdings farmed for the duration of the pension by younger farmers who met the eligibility conditions of the scheme. In cases where the retiring farmers transferred their holdings by lease, such leases were normally for five years. If the pension had some period to run when a lease expired, the retired farmer was obliged either to renew the lease or to find another eligible transferee.</P>
        <P>I recognise that following the introduction of the single payment scheme, and the provisions allowing farmers to consolidate their entitlements in certain circumstances, some retired farmers may face difficulties in getting their transferees to renew leases or in finding replacement transferees. My officials are in contact with the European Commission in an effort to secure arrangements that will safeguard the pensions of the retired farmers in such cases.</P>

	<P>The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum amount provided for by the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted on legal grounds that a fixed rate be set instead.</P>

        <Quest>her views on the implications for this country of the recent discovery of BSE in a goat in France and the confirmation that the condition has now jumped a species; the esti<Col N="1511"/>mated number of goats here; the steps that are being taken to ensure that BSE does not spread to the Irish goat herd; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6962/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Until recently BSE had never been found under natural circumstances in ruminants other than cattle. Its presence in goats or other ruminants had been viewed as theoretically possible but had not previously been detected. Arising from an EU testing programme, a healthy goat slaughtered in 2002 in France was tested at random for evidence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, TSE. Based on the initial positive finding of a TSE which differed from the normal scrapie strain, further scientific studies were carried out, leading to the conclusion by French experts that the brain could be BSE positive.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission submitted the data received from the French authorities to the Community Reference Laboratory for TSEs in Weybridge, England for evaluation by an expert panel. The panel completed its evaluation and on 28 January this year the Commission confirmed the presence of BSE in the animal in question.</P>
        <P>The European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, has advised that based on current scientific knowledge, milk and products derived from milk are unlikely to present any risk of TSE contamination, if the milk comes from healthy animals. Exclusion of animals with mastitis is considered to reduce the risk. As regards meat, specified risk materials are required to be removed from goats slaughtered at abattoirs.</P>
        <P>In the light of the foregoing, and on the basis of advice from EFSA, no changes have been proposed by the Commission in relation to the consumption of milk, cheese or meat from goats. However, EFSA will give further consideration to the meat aspect.</P>
        <P>Since BSE was discovered in cattle, an extensive monitoring and surveillance regime for scrapie and BSE has been in place also for sheep and goats throughout the EU. Given this surveillance, the finding of isolated cases would not indicate a widespread problem. The goat population in the EU is small &mdash; 12.7 million compared to 89.2 million sheep in 2003. Widespread testing of sheep has been undertaken and all results to date have been negative for BSE.</P>
        <P>Following the confirmation of BSE in the goat on the 28 January, the Commission has moved quickly to expand the testing of goats. The EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health agreed on 3 February that over the next six months 176,000 tests will be conducted on healthy animals across the EU and 25,000 on goats that had died on the farm. This intensified regime will set the highest quotas for countries which have large goat populations and where BSE has been detected in cattle.</P>
        <P>The goat population in Ireland is estimated at 17,000. A number of samples from goats have <Col N="1512"/>been tested here for TSEs recently and all were negative. My Department is compiling a register of goat herds and will in the months ahead be introducing a full identification system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Punchestown lands are owned by the Kildare Hunt Club. A new organisational structure has been agreed under which a joint venture company made up of the Kildare Hunt Club and Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, has been incorporated. It is the intention that ownership of the Punchestown companies will transfer to the new company as soon as the question of the existence of any taxation liabilities of the Kildare Hunt Club to the Revenue Commissioners has been finalised. Conflicting legal advice has been received by the Kildare Hunt Club and HRI on the taxation liabilities. The Kildare Hunt Club advice was to the effect that the leases on which the potential tax liability might arise were in fact invalid. Based on this advice the hunt club has made a submission to the Revenue Commissioners and the restructuring and the transfer of assets to the joint venture company cannot be finalised until the outcome of this submission is known.</P>
        <P>HRI, which provided funding to the Punchestown racecourse and the Department of Agriculture and Food which provided the funding for the event centre at Punchestown have received written assurances from the chairman of the Kildare Hunt Club that no changes will be attempted to be made to the existing lease arrangement without the interests of HRI and the Department of Agriculture and Food being fully protected. The chairman has been informed by my Department that it will hold him to this undertaking.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if she is satisfied that all meat and meat products sold here are labelled accurately to reflect their country of origin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The general labelling regulations covering all food sold in Ireland require that the information be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer.</P>
        <P>European Directive 2000/13/EC on the labelling of foodstuffs requires pre-packaged foodstuffs to carry information on the source or place of origin only where its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree on the origin of foodstuffs or their raw materials.</P>
        <P>The Community labelling requirements apply to all meat products and are compulsory in all member states. In addition, there are further labelling requirements that apply to beef sold at retail level regardless of whether that beef was produced within the community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the community from a third country that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as &ldquo;Origin: non-EC&rdquo; along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place. This detailed labelling system for beef sold at retail level, goes beyond the general labelling legislation provisions.</P>
        <P>While these EU regulations do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level, it is my intention to proceed with a national legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef sold in such premises and outlets, and I have raised this with the Commission. I am in consultation with my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children with regard to framing a suitable legal text within which to implement these requirements and proposals to this effect will be brought forward once the legal options allowing for this development have been fully examined. In this regard also I am examining the scope for extending origin labelling to other meat products.</P>
        <P>On a general level, I believe consumers should be given maximum information on the origin of the food they are purchasing. I have this week along with other member states urged the Commission to examine EU labelling provisions to facilitate this, and in doing so, indicated the particular need for attention to be paid to the origin of poultry imports to the EU. In this context, regulations requiring poultry meat originating in a county outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises were introduced in Ireland last year.</P>

        <P>The FIRM programme has encouraged high-quality research outputs and outcomes across a range of food science disciplines. In so doing, the measure has supported the building of a substantial base of highly qualified researchers at doctorate and post-doctorate level, whose proven research capacity is attractive to the agri-food industry.</P>
        <P>The opportunities offered by such public good food research programmes have contributed to the formation of recognised centres of excellence in food research in Ireland and this in turn has been instrumental in researchers gaining access to EU and national funded research programmes. A number of research teams have been created at the various institutions &mdash; universities and Teagasc food centres &mdash; as a result of funding from FIRM, and the capability and critical mass that has been developed, together with the associated knowledge base, represents a major resource for industry.</P>
        <P>In addition, the public good food research programmes have been instrumental in the development of a number of food products which contribute to the health and nutritional intake of the consumer.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the <Col N="1516"/>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland submitted an action programme for further implementation of the directive to the European Commission on 22 October 2004. The Commission conveyed its view, by way of a Letter of Formal Notice under Article 228 of the EU Treaty issued to Ireland dated 22 December 2004, that the action programme is not complete and does not comply with the requirements of the directive and the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland delivered on 11 March 2004.</P>
        <P>My Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of a response to the Commission. Senior officials from my Department and their counterparts in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are in contact with the relevant Commission officials and this process of consultation and negotiation is continuing. Agreement with the Commission is necessary not only to avoid the risk of substantial fines on Ireland but also to safeguard ongoing EU funding of rural development measures.</P>
        <P>It remains my objective, and it is also the objective of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to reach agreement on an action programme that meets the objectives of the nitrates directive in terms of safeguarding water quality, while minimising the burden of compliance that the agreement will place on farmers and safeguarding the future of the commercial farming sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by the Deputies relate to proposals for forestry contained in the draft rural development regulation 2007-13, first published by the European Commission last summer, and which is the subject of ongoing negotiations in Brussels. I must emphasise that these are merely proposals at this stage and they are some way from agreement in their present format.</P>
        <P>When the proposed new regulation was first published, Ireland was one of the first member states to recognise the threat that the draft regulation posed to countries with active afforestation programmes.</P>
        <P>From the outset, the Irish position on the draft regulation in relation to forestry has been clear and unequivocal. We have continually and consistently made known our opposition to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals particularly those proposing to reduce establishment grants, premiums and associated premium payment periods.</P>
        <P>This is the position we have articulated consistently at every level from working group up to the Agriculture Council. I expressed my views on the impact of the proposals for forestry in Ireland at the ministerial Agriculture Council meeting in November 2004 and directly to Commissioner Fischer Boel. I restated these views, at the Agriculture Council meeting this week.</P>
        <P>We will continue to work at all levels to achieve the best possible deal for Ireland in the admittedly tough negotiations that lie ahead. Early on in the process I established a consultative-liaison group, comprising representatives of the forestry sector, which meets regularly. Through this group, the sector is consulted and informed of developments.</P>
        <P>Final decisions on the proposed regulations are not expected to be taken by the Council of Ministers for some months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Up to last Friday, 25 February, over 17,000 applications have been received for REPS 3 since its introduction in June 2004. With some 27,000 farmers in REPS 2 this brings the overall participation level in REPS to approximately 44,000.</P>
        <P>The level of applications received under REPS 3 compares very favourably with any similar time period since REPS began in 1994 and is very encouraging. I expect participation levels to surpass the previous peak of 45,500 by the middle of this year. My Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2005 includes &euro;271 million for REPS which represents an increase of 30% on the 2004 outturn and will, I believe, be sufficient to accommodate demand.</P>
        <P>The current scheme is covered by EU Commission Regulation on Rural Development 1257/1999, which runs to the end of 2006. The next programming period will run from 2007 to 2013 and the regulations are already at an advanced stage of drafting. It is already clear that they will provide for agri-environment. The precise shape of the successor to REPS will be determined in the light of these regulations when they are finalised, but there is every reason to expect that we can make another scheme available that will be attractive to farmers while continuing to deliver environmental benefits and public good as well. In negotiating the terms of this new scheme and the level of EU funding for it with the Commission, it will be important to be able to point to REPS 3 as a success. It is important, therefore, that all parties including the farming organisations work to encourage and facilitate the highest possible take-up of the scheme for the remainder of the current period.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>My Department in association with Teagasc has for some time been evaluating the possible effect on farming of the further implementation of the directive. These studies have indicated that the great majority of farmers are already operating below the general limit of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare specified in the directive and so their stocking levels would not be affected. A proportion of farmers, mainly in the dairy sector, operate above that level. A proposal has been made to the European Commission for arrangements that would allow farmers to continue to operate at organic nitrogen levels of up to 250 kg per hectare level under appropriate conditions. The Commission has indicated that it will consider this proposal when the nitrates action programme itself is agreed.</P>
        <P>Teagasc, at my Department&rsquo;s request, is currently finalising a farm facilities survey to establish baseline data on farm facilities and management practices relating to manure, dirty water and fodder systems. This survey will allow a more precise assessment of the amount of additional manure storage capacity that will be needed to meet the requirements of the action programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The review and appraisal of Ireland&rsquo;s forestry development strategy undertaken by Peter Bacon and Associates is a key element of a review of the sector. The proposals in the review are being considered in conjunction with the draft EU regulation on rural development policy, which proposes reductions in EU financial support for forestry. The Bacon report reaffirmed the need for an approved planting target of 20,000 hectares per annum but commented that a lesser planting target could be a viable basis for support, providing the planting is undertaken in a manner that maximises the non-timber benefits.</P>
        <P>Given that EU funding of forestry currently accounts for up to 60% of public investment in the sector, proposals for the further development of the sector must await the final terms of the rural development regulation and consideration of the likely impact on Irish forestry.</P>
        <P>For 2005, I have made sufficient funds available to support an increased planting programme of some 15,000 hectares, which compares with the 11,000 hectares planted in 2004.</P>
        <P>The current availability of grant aid at 100% for planting and the annual premiums, and particularly the concession obtained in relation to the stacking entitlements <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the single payment scheme, make forestry a very attractive land use option for farmers.</P>

	<P>There have been a number of positive developments in the area of food labelling, most of which emanated from the report of the food labelling group, which was established in June 2002. The group reported in December of that year with a series of recommendations. The recommendations were accepted. As food labelling is a particularly complicated and broad based area, involving a number of Departments and agencies, an interdepartmental and agency group was established to progress the implementation of the report.</P>
        <P>Good progress has been made to date in relation to the implementation of the recommendations in the labelling report. There were a total of 21 recommendations, many of which are beyond the remit of my Department and some of which were to be activated only after others had been completed.</P>
        <P>The two main issues that emanated from the recommendations of the labelling group were centralising enforcement in one agency and the definition of origin.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of all of the food labelling regulations has now been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This will not only streamline the enforcement measures but will also provide a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. The centralisation of food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, in both the Department of Health and Children and my Department achieves another recommendation of the food labelling group. There was full agreement within the food labelling group <Col N="1522"/>that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers&rsquo; wishes in this area. The consumer liaison panel has carried out this research, the results of which were presented in December 2003.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of 2004, two regulations in relation to the labelling of poultry meat were introduced. The first of these regulations requires poultrymeat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose, non-prepackaged, poultrymeat to be provided to the consumer.</P>
        <P>EU regulations provide for a detailed labelling system for beef to be applied at retail sale, which is over and above the general labelling provisions. These regulations do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level. It is my intention to proceed with a legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef served on such premises. The legal options allowing for this development are being examined at present.</P>
        <P>On the food labelling issue in general, I must emphasise that my primary aim is to protect consumer interest and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and indeed there are also considerable imports, so it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels. I hope to achieve this through the implementation in as full a manner as possible of the recommendations of the food labelling group.</P>
        <P>There have been significant developments on food labelling and I am satisfied that there are other issues of concern are being actively addressed. Today&rsquo;s consumers should be in a position to make food consumption choices which best suit their circumstances and preferences, and an appropriate labelling system is a key element in bringing this about.</P>

	<P>With regard to EU trade under the single market trade in animals and animal products is permitted on the basis that harmonised controls apply. These controls are set down in Council Directives 90/425/EEC, 89/662/EEC and 91/628/EC. Animal products being imported into Ireland must come from an EU-approved premises and bear an EU health mark. A health certificate must accompany all animals imported. The contents of the health certificate were harmonised under Commission Regulation 599/2004 and contain details of the requirements the animal must fulfil prior to travel and the inspections carried out to ensure that these requirements are fulfilled. These conditions are set down to protect animal health and public health. My Department also requires that advance notification of any import be given.</P>
        <P>With regard to imports from outside the EU, strict conditions are also in force to prevent the introduction of disease. These include a requirement that the exporting country has been approved by the EU as having veterinary controls at least equivalent to those in place in the EU. The animal or animal product must originate from an area where there are no restrictions imposed under EU safeguard measures, must come from establishments which are under the supervision and control of the competent authorities and must be correctly identified and be accompanied by the specific health certificate conforming to the models laid down in EU legislation. Imports into the EU must be presented for veterinary inspection at an EU approved border inspection post following the submission of advance notification.</P>
        <P>Compulsory six-month quarantine applies to all pet dogs and cats brought into Ireland from any country not deemed low risk for rabies under the harmonized EU system on the movement of pets. Pet dogs and cats from low-risk countries may be brought directly into Ireland provided that conditions on identification, vaccination and blood testing are met.</P>
        <P>In relation to plant health, Council Directive 2000/29/EC sets out the restrictions and protective measures which aim to protect plant health within the European Community. This directive is transposed into Irish law under SI 894 of 2004, European Communities (Control of Organisms harmful to Plants and Plant Products) Regulations 2004.</P><Col N="1524"/>
        <P>My Department enforces these regulations which provide for controls on imports, exports and movement of plants and plant products in the country. If plants or plant products are found not to comply with the regulations then appropriate measures are taken including appropriate treatment or destruction. These measures prevent the introduction or spread of plant diseases and pests and ensure the high plant health status of the country.</P>

	<P>New planting over the last number of years has averaged out at approximately 14,000 hectares per annum. The outturn for 2004 is estimated to be in the region of 11,000 hectares. This year, I am making sufficient funding available to increase the level of planting to 15,000 hectares. Achieving this target is of course dependent on demand materialising from land-owners, principally farmers. However, given the unprecedented concessions on stacking which were won by Ireland in the CAP negotiations, I am hopeful that many farmers will see that forestry has a valuable role to play in their future.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>The most recent estimate of the total turnover of the forestry sector, as published in A Review and Appraisal of Ireland&rsquo;s Forestry Development Strategy by economic consultants, Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, is &euro;763 million in 2002.

	<P>Teagasc the agriculture and food development authority, was established under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988. Its function under the Act is to provide research, training and advisory services for the agri-food sector. Teagasc is governed by an 11-member authority. The chairman and five ordinary members are appointed by the Minister and the remaining five members are appointed by the Minister following nominations from designated organisations: IFA, ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme and Teagasc unions.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has 1,360 permanent staff, comprising advisers, teachers and research scientists with appropriate supporting services. These are complemented by 250 contract staff, as well as teaching staff in the private agricultural and horticultural colleges. Teagasc staff carry out their functions from more than 90 locations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc&rsquo;s operating budget for 2005 amounts to over &euro;155 million. Advisory services make up the biggest budget item &mdash; 35% of expenditure, followed by production research, 32%, training programmes, 19%, and food research, 13%. My Department&rsquo;s provision to Teagasc for capital and non-capital purposes in 2005 amounts to &euro;123 million. The amount for non-capital purposes is &euro;118.5 million and for capital development purposes the allocation is &euro;4.5 million. By any standards these are substantial resources and are a clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Teagasc authority to prioritise activities and allocate its funding accordingly. This it has done over the years in accordance with the needs of clients, EU and Government policy and industry needs. I am satisfied that in doing so it has provided a first class service to Irish farmers.</P>
        <P>In the short term Teagasc will have to reconfigure its programmes in response to the fundamental changes in agriculture arising out of the single payment. The authority is however already well accustomed to tailoring its programmes to meet the changing requirements of the agri-food sector. Its annual programme of activities is <Col N="1526"/>developed in consultation with the key stakeholders in the sector many of whom are represented on the authority. Recently it has undertaken more strategic planning initiatives, the Teagasc 2000 review and the three-year strategy required under the strategic management initiative. A new review of its training and education programmes has recently got under way.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Teagasc is well placed to face the future and to continue to provide the innovation and technology transfer for the sustainable development of agriculture, the food industry and rural communities in the years ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am keenly aware of the need to make available appropriate supports for small farmers. In this regard, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, small farmers benefit from all of the supports, within the legal framework of the European Union, administered by my Department.</P>
        <P>One of the areas where this is possible is the rural environment protection scheme, REPS. The latest version of the scheme was introduced in June 2004. In addition to an average increase of 28% in payment rates, payment of &euro;200 per hectare is also provided for the first 20 hectares, and &euro;175 per hectare for the next 20 hectares, and for further payment digression thereafter.</P>
        <P>Under the CAP rural development plan 2000-2006 compensatory allowances payable in the disadvantaged areas moved from a payment per animal to a payment based on area. Under the new area based scheme, farmers in the disadvantaged areas with a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare can qualify for payment on up to 45 hectares of land. At present, approximately 99,800 farmers qualify for payments totalling &euro;231 million annually. This represents an average payment of &euro;2,315 compared with an average payment of &euro;1,523 under the old headage schemes. The smaller farmer has clearly benefited under the new scheme which will continue in its present format for 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P>Details of new criteria for designation of disadvantaged areas from 2007 onward have recently been received from the European Commission and are being examined in detail by my Department. I have signalled to the Commission the sensitivity of this issue to Ireland in order to ensure that the new criteria do not reduce in any way the benefits of the compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the milk quota restructuring programme, which I announced before Christmas, small farmers again receive particular consideration in that producers with a quota of less than 350,000 litres will be able to purchase twice the <Col N="1527"/>amount available to larger producers in the same co-op area. Moreover, younger farmers with less than 350,000 litres will have priority access to a further 25% of the pool.</P>
        <P>In the milk quota appeals tribunal hardship scheme for 2004-05, priority is being given to applications from small-scale producers. In addition, support is available to eligible farmers under the farm assist scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>Preliminary figures relating to the incidence of bovine TB in 2004 show a significant improvement on the position in 2003. The positive trend of recent years continued and the current estimate is that the number of reactors in 2004 will be under 23,000. This represents close on a 50% fall in reactor numbers from 1998 to 2004.</P>
        <P>The incidence of brucellosis also continued to decline in 2004. The number of laboratory positives has fallen from 6,417 in 1998 to 664 last year. This represents a 90% reduction in disease levels in that period. During the same period, the total number of animals slaughtered under the eradication programme fell from 29,778 to 6,195.</P>
        <P>The substantial improvement in the national situation for both of these diseases is due to a number of factors, including improved co-operation from all interested parties. I am confident that this progress can be maintained into the future with the continued operation of the existing measures and the ongoing cooperation of farmers and all involved in the livestock industry. It will be necessary, however, in the medium term to continue with the existing comprehensive control and eradication measures, which have brought about positive results in recent years in terms of reduced incidence of the disease.</P>

	<P>European Council Regulation 1782/2003 governing the single payment scheme provides that each member state must set up a national reserve using between 1% and 3% of every individual farmer&rsquo;s entitlements. A single <Col N="1528"/>payment advisory group comprising representatives from the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department has been set up to advise on the national reserve. A 3% provisional reduction for the national reserve is reflected in the certificates of provisional entitlements that have already issued to farmers.</P>
        <P>I have already decided that in the event of the sum of individual payment entitlements for Irish farmers exceeding our financial ceiling, thus necessitating a linear percentage reduction for all farmers, such linear percentage reduction would be accommodated within the 3% provisional reduction already applied for the national reserve.</P>
        <P>The Council regulation also provides for a reduction for modulation of 3% in 2005 rising by a further 1% in each of 2006 and 2007. The 3% deduction for modulation has also been reflected in the provisional statements of entitlements, which have already issued. However, a refund of this money will be made in respect of the first &euro;5,000 of the single payment in each case. It is estimated that 46% of Irish farmers will, in effect, not be subject to modulation at all.</P>

	<P>On 24 February 2005 the CSO published the revised output, input and income statement for agriculture, which reports a 3% increase in aggregate farm income in 2004 compared with a 2.2% increase in inflation in the same year. The 3% increase in incomes should be viewed posi<Col N="1529"/>tively when account is taken of the fact that a substantial amount of payments on 2004 premia entitlements will be paid in 2005 in conjunction with the single farm payment. These include a 40% balancing payment due on livestock premia compared with 20% in the previous four years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The designation of land under the EU birds and habitats directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon Callows area is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department, and I understand that discussions on the matter with the farming bodies have been going on for some time and are not yet concluded.</P>
        <P>I have already introduced arrangements designed specifically to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon Callows. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS, but believe that the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the directives, may now also apply to the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation. Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, they had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by the national parks and wildlife service but could not benefit from both. This further concession was additional to the inclusion of a new supplementary measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas are already eligible for payments under REPS measure A of &euro;242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares, and the new supplementary measure provides for an additional payment of &euro;100 per hectare on particular sites in the callows which are important corncrake habitats.

        <P>REPS is a highly successful agri-environment measure and is acknowledged as such by the European Commission. One of the features of REPS which the Commission has commended is the fact that the whole farm is subjected to the full range of basic undertakings. This model has served Irish farmers well since the introduction of REPS in 1994 and it is not my intention to depart from the whole farm approach to accommodate a situation which I believe I have already addressed adequately.</P>

	<P>The most recent figures available from the CSO show that there were 77,900 full-time farmers in 2003, a drop of 20,400 since 1997. Over the same period the number of part-time farmers increased by 7,900 to 57,200. This ongoing trend towards part-time farming reflects a combination of factors including the increased availability of off-farm employment and the need for farmers to choose the most effective path to maximise competitiveness and the optimal level of efficient production. In recent years the choice for farmers has tended to involve a combination of part-time farming and the farmer or spouse holding an off-farm job.</P>
        <P>This trend away from full-time farming towards the part-time option is expected to continue under the new system of decoupled farm payments. The recent report of the Agri Vision 2015 Committee stated that off-farm employment and income are now standard parts of farm family work and income patterns. It went on to state that there seems to be no doubt that present patterns and trends will continue and that farm household income reliance on off-farm employment will increase under the newly reformed CAP.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision by Greencore Group plc-Irish Sugar Limited to close its sugar plant in Carlow and to consolidate all of its sugar manu<Col N="1531"/>facturing in Mallow was a commercial decision taken by the company in light of the increasing competition in the sugar market and taking account of the reality that changes will occur in the industry as a consequence of the reform of the EU sugar regime and of WTO developments. The trend towards rationalisation and increased productivity in the sugar sector has been evident throughout the EU for some time. In the EU-15, for example, the number of sugar plants declined from 240 to 135 between 1990 and 2001, while employment in the sector declined from 37,000 to just over 20,000 over the same period.</P>
        <P>Following the closure of the Carlow plant, Greencore intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at the Mallow plant. The latter plant will be upgraded at a cost of up to &euro;25 million, demonstrating the company&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining an efficient sugar processing industry in Ireland into the future. I have had several meeting with stakeholders, including farm organisations, about the future of sugar beet growing and processing in this country in the context of the forthcoming reform of the EU sugar regime. It is this reform that poses the real challenge for the Irish sugar industry and I will be continuing my efforts to ensure that the future shape of the EU sugar regime will be consistent with the continuance of an efficient sugar beet growing and processing industry in this country.</P>

	<P>The EU Commission outlined its initial ideas for reform of the EU sugar regime in a communication to the Council and the European Parliament last July. The communication was the subject of technical discussions at Council working group level in Brussels and there was a policy debate at the Council of Agriculture Ministers&rsquo; meeting in November.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s initial ideas for reform would, if adopted, have serious repercussions for sugar beet growing and processing in this country and I have made it clear in discussions in the Council of Ministers that they are unacceptable. Ireland is in a group of ten member states with shared concerns about the Commission&rsquo;s proposals in their current form and we made a joint ministerial submission to the Commission outlining these concerns. The next step will be the publication of formal legislative proposals by the Commission. These are expected to emerge in June after the outcome of the EU appeal against the ruling of the WTO sugar panel. In the forthcoming negotiations, my overall objective will be to ensure that the future shape of the EU sugar regime is consistent with the con<Col N="1532"/>tinuation of an efficient sugar beet growing and processing industry in this country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 178 together.</P>
        <P>The possibility of producing bio-fuel from sugar beet is ultimately a commercial matter for Irish Sugar Limited. The company has indicated that following the closure of the Carlow plant, it intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which will be upgraded. Arrangements are being made to transport the sugar beet from the Carlow catchment area to Mallow. I am concerned about the loss of jobs associated with the closure of the Carlow factory and the personal impact the job losses will have on families. I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I am aware that Enterprise Ireland is actively looking at replacement jobs for the area.</P>
        <P>Promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In so far as renewable energy crops are concerned, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003 establishing the single payment scheme, introduced an aid of &euro;45 per hectare per year for areas sown with energy crops. The aid is granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and a processor, except in the case of processing undertaken by the farmer on his holding. Agricultural raw materials, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme provided the crops are intended primarily for use in the production of products considered to be biofuels and for electric and thermal energy produced from biomass.</P>
        <P>A maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares for which aid for energy crops can be granted has been established in the European Union. According to figures provided by the EU Commission, in excess of 303,000 hectares was sown with energy crops in 2004, of which 439 hectares were Irish. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition <Col N="1533"/>to their entitlement under the single farm payment. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme. Biomass production from early forest thinning and short-rotation forestry crops offer considerable scope for use in renewable heat and electrical energy production. In this regard, my Department, through the offices of the National Council for Forest Research and Development, is closely involved with the work of the bioenergy strategy group. This group was established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in association with Sustainable Energy Ireland in December 2003. The objective of this group is to consider the policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the penetration of biomass energy in Ireland. The group is inputting into the renewable energy development group which is a group established and chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

        <P>In January 1999 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland was established as a statutory, independent and science-based body operating under the aegis of my Department. Its principal function is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that food produced, distributed or marketed in the State meets the highest standards of food safety and in particular to ensure that such food complies with food legislation and where appropriate with recognised codes of good practice. The authority carries out its enforcement functions through service contracts with official agencies. These contracts outline an agreed level and standard of food safety activity that the agencies perform as agents of the authority. The authority has service contracts with county councils and city councils, the Health Service Executive &mdash; formerly the health boards, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Marine Institute.

	<P>Cheques written and not presented for payment to a bank are cancelled out of date automatically after six months. In the matter of funding provided for the health services, approximately 83% of gross spending is Exchequer funding, with the remainder coming from health agencies income, which includes patient charges and payroll deductions, and appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprised health contributions, excise duty on tobacco and recovery of health service costs under EU regulations.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, my Department has requested the chief officer of each of the executive&rsquo;s regional areas to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested.</P>

	<P>There are currently nine EU directives for which my Department has responsibility which have yet to be implemented. The deadline has passed in the case of five of these. However, one of the five directives was transposed through a number of sections in Part 3 of the Finance Act 2004 ahead of the transposition deadline of 1 January 2005 but the European Commission is still treating it as being overdue. Attempts are being made to resolve the issue. Two of the five listed as being overdue will be transposed in the Finance Bill 2005 while in the case of a third, a statutory instrument is in the process of being finalised and will be transposed speedily. An infringement notice, No. 2004/0921, has been received in respect of the remaining directive where the transposition deadline has passed. This will be transposed shortly. The details of each of the directives are as follows:</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P LI="1">1. Directive 2003/98/EC: Re-use of Public Sector Information. This directive lays down ground rules for the re-use of public sector information for commercial purposes. The deadline for implementation is 1 July 2005.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Directive 2004/18/EC: Revised Public Sector Procurement Directive. This directive co-ordinates the procurement procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006.</P><Col N="1540"/>
        <P LI="1">3. Directive 2004/17/EC: Revised Utilities Sector Procurement Directive. This directive co-ordinates the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sector. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Directive 2004/39/EC: Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MIFID. This directive allows investment firms to provide their services across the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation, that is, it will give them an effective &ldquo;single passport&rdquo;. The deadline for implementation is 30 April 2006.</P>
        <P LI="1">5. Directive 2004/069 Commission Directive of 27 April 2004. This directive amends the definition of &ldquo;multilateral development banks&rdquo; in the codified banking directive to include the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, MIGA. The deadline for implementation was 30 June 2004. An infringement notice, No. 2004/0921, has been received. This directive will be transposed shortly.</P>
        <P LI="1">6. Council Directive 2003/92/EC of 7 October 2003 amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the rules for VAT on the place of supply of gas and electricity. This directive was transposed through a number of sections in Part 3 of the Finance Act 2004 ahead of the transposition deadline of 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P LI="1">7. Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity. The deadline was 31 December 2003. Ireland was already in compliance with all significant requirements of the directive prior to 1 January 2004. In relation to the outstanding elements of this directive, we have already informed the Commission that they will be transposed through the Finance Bill 2005.</P>
        <P LI="1">8. Council Directive 2004/56/EC of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums. The deadline was 1 January 2005. A statutory instrument is in the process of being finalised and will be transposed speedily.</P>
        <P LI="1">9. Council Directive 2004/66/EC of 26 April 2004 adapting a number directives, in the fields of free movement of goods, freedom to provide services, agriculture, transport policy and taxation by reason of the accession of the ten new member states. The deadline was 1 May 2004. The remaining taxation aspects of this directive, namely the taxation of savings aspects, will be transposed through the Finance Bill 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are two cases where directives have already been transposed but where a legal action <Col N="1541"/>has been notified or commenced by the EU Commission.</P>
        <P>The first relates to infringement notice, No. 2004/0924, for Commission Directive 2004/79/EC of 4 March 2004. That directive adapting Directive 2002/94/EC in the field of taxation, by reason of the accession of the ten new member states was transposed into Irish law on 15 December 2004 by way of a Statutory Instrument No. 851 of 2004. In response to the infringement notice of 13 December 2004, the Irish permanent representation notified the Commission of our previous correspondence alerting them to the directive&rsquo;s transposition and subsequently sought the withdrawal of the infringement notice. As a result of further follow up contact, we now understand that it will be proposed that the infringement procedure be suspended in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The second relates to infringement notice, No 2004/4084, which has been received from the European Commission concerning the general treatment for VAT purposes of services provided by public bodies and local authorities and the transposition in this regard of certain provisions of the sixth VAT directive. The sixth VAT directive has been transposed into Irish law but the Commission is now querying the completeness of the transposition in the area of the general treatment for VAT purposes of services provided by public bodies and local authorities.</P>
        <P>Every effort is being made in my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, to ensure that outstanding directives will be transposed as a matter of urgency and that remaining directives will be transposed on time and that the other issues raised by the Commission will be resolved as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to non-deposit-taking financial service providers who offer loans secured on property to persons who are perceived as poor credit risks and are thus unable to secure credit from mainstream lenders.</P>
        <P>The Consumer Credit Act is the principal source of protection to personal borrowers. All financial service providers that provide loans secured on a person&rsquo;s principal private residence are subject to the provisions of Part 9 of the Act. This is as a result of an amendment to the Act <Col N="1542"/>made last year, following consideration of a recommendation of the 1999 McDowell report.</P>
        <P>The Act subjects all lenders who provide finance on the security of the family home to a range of obligations. These include: provision of a written loan agreement; quoting the APR and any other fees that will be charged; a requirement to warn the borrower about the risk of losing their home; and an obligation to put mortgage protection insurance in place. Apart from the special case of the family home, the Act does not apply where a loan is given for a commercial purpose.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory oversight of interest rates, except for the special case of moneylenders who come within the scope of Part 8 of the Consumer Credit Act. This special category of lender typically provides short-term loans to poor credit risks at very high APRs. Such lenders are required to hold a moneylender&rsquo;s licence and the financial regulator can refuse to grant such a licence on the grounds that the cost of credit is excessive. The requirement to hold such a licence, and the corresponding oversight of interest rates, only applies to this specialist category of lender.</P>
        <P>The financial regulator already has the power under the Consumer Credit Act to give directions to a mortgage lender in relation to misleading advertising, as well as to prosecute for breaches of the Act. In addition, under the legislation establishing the regulator, its consumer director has responsibility for monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers generally and the power to require a provider of such services to furnish information relevant to any inquiry or study that the director chooses to undertake.</P>
        <P>I am at present consulting the Ombudsman Council about the financial service providers, not regulated by the financial regulator, that should be brought within the scope of the Financial Services Ombudsman, when the ombudsman commences operations on 1 April. The ombudsman has extensive powers to provide redress to consumers who have been unfairly treated by a financial service provider. Subject to the views of the council, I can see merit in including those mortgage lenders who provide loans secured on a person&rsquo;s principal residence.</P>
        <P>The authorisation and supervision system that is in place in relation to deposit-taking institutions is primarily designed to protect their depositor customers and the general stability of the financial system. I do not at present have evidence to suggest that an extension of the financial regulator&rsquo;s powers in relation to non-deposit-taking mortgage lenders would be justified, bearing in mind that there are no depositors to be considered and that the additional costs involved would ultimately fall on their borrower customers. However, should such evidence emerge from consideration by the financial regulator, the ombudsman or other sources, I am open to making suitable amendments to the law. The forthcoming Bill to consolidate and modernise <Col N="1543"/>our financial services legislation could offer a suitable vehicle for such amendments.</P>

        <P>As part of my Department&rsquo;s evaluation of the plan of development process including pipelines, an independent evaluation of the pipeline design code was commissioned from an experienced petroleum pipeline consultant, Mr. Andrew Johnston. The consultant&rsquo;s report entitled &ldquo;Corrib Gas Pipeline Project: Report on Evaluation of Onshore Pipeline Design Code&rdquo;, submitted to my Department in March 2002 concluded as follows: the pipeline design code has been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations and is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions; the design of the onshore pipeline is generally in accordance with code selection and best national and international industry practice, provided that the actions recommended in section 2.2 are followed; the pipeline is considered to be adequately protected from third party interference by burial to 1.2 metres and provision of marker tape above the pipeline; the pipeline is considered to meet public safety requirements as outlined in the selected design code, provided that the actions recommended in section 2.2 are followed.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of section 2.2 have been incorporated in the statutory approvals issued for the Corrib development. The design of the control system ensures that any damage to the umbilical system will result in the gas wells being shut down. I advise the Deputy that all subsea wells are designed in this way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to commission a feasibility study into the need, or otherwise, for any further peat-fired electricity generating plant. The location, construction and operation of electricity generating stations are liberalised activities in an open and competitive market. An authorisation is required to construct a generating station and a licence is required to generate electricity as prescribed by the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. These are issued by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. Responsibility for security of supply also rests with the CER. In addition, planning permission is required from the local authority concerned and a grid connection must be secured from ESB national grid. Appropriate licences and authorisations, such as an integrated pollution <Col N="1545"/>control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, are also necessary.</P>
        <P>I do not have a function in any of these matters. It is a matter, therefore, for market players to undertake whatever feasibility studies they deem necessary in order to make a commercial decision on whether or not to enter the electricity market. The Deputy will be aware that public service obligation, PSO, arrangements, which were notified to the EU Commission in November 2000, are in place in respect of peat generation for security of supply reasons. These arrangements provide for the use of peat in three generating plants in the Midlands &mdash; one independently owned and operating since December 2000, and two owned and operated by the ESB.</P>
        <P>The PSO levy, which is charged to all consumers and impacts on the country&rsquo;s energy costs, compensates the ESB for the additional costs incurred in using peat in electricity generation. I am satisfied that the level of peat in the generating fuel mix is sufficient. I do not believe there is an adequate basis for reopening this issue with the EU Commission.</P>

	<P>More than five years since the end of the conflict in 1999, the unresolved fate of missing persons is a continuing tragedy for many families in Kosovo. This is, above all, a serious humanitarian issue. It is also an obstacle to the reconciliation between communities which is essential for the creation of a democratic, multi-ethnic society in Kosovo.</P><Col N="1546"/>
        <P>The International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations interim Administration in Kosovo have determined that over 3,000 people are still unaccounted for since the end of the conflict in Kosovo. The majority of these are from the Kosovo Albanian community but the figure includes several hundred Kosovo Serbs and people from other ethnic minority communities. The Kosovo Action Network has focused in particular on the unacceptable failure of the Serb authorities to release the bodies of some 800 people believed to have been killed in Kosovo, which were exhumed from mass graves in Serbia in 2001.</P>
        <P>I agree fully with Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, the special representative of the UN Secretary General in Kosovo, that the families of the missing have been suffering for too long. The authorities concerned have a clear responsibility to do everything in their power to resolve this issue without any further delay.</P>
        <P>As a result of the efforts of the EU and the UN, in co-operation with the Government of Serbia and the provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo, progress was made in October 2003 on the opening of a direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina on issues of mutual concern. A working group on missing persons was established, but met only once, in March 2004. The direct dialogue was suspended following the outbreak of ethnic violence in Kosovo on 17 March 2004.</P>
        <P>The EU and the wider international community have strongly encouraged both sides, and Belgrade in particular, to resume the direct dialogue. I welcome the progress which has been made in recent weeks as a result of meetings between Mr. Soren Jessen Petersen and the authorities in Belgrade. As a result, the direct dialogue on missing persons will resume on 10 March, with a meeting in Belgrade, under the auspices of the special representative of the UN Secretary General and chaired by the International Committee of the Red Cross. It is essential that all parties engage in the dialogue with a determination to achieve early results for the families of all the missing in Kosovo.</P>
        <P>This will be a crucial year for Kosovo. During the summer, the UN will preside over a comprehensive review of the implementation of reforms based on European standards. If the review is positive, it will be followed by the opening of a process to agree the constitutional status of Kosovo, which will be facilitated by the international community. The EU will play an important role in this process, in order to ensure that the agreed outcome is fully compatible with the process of European integration. In these circumstances, it is essential that a real dialogue resumes between Belgrade and Pristina and that the Kosovo Serb community now has the confidence to re-engage in the political process as soon <Col N="1547"/>as possible, and take its place in the provisional institutions of self government.</P>
        <P>The EU has given a clear commitment that the long-term future of the western Balkans region, including Kosovo, rests within the European Union. The meeting of the External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 21 February, confirmed that Kosovo will not return to the situation which existed before 1999, and reaffirmed the commitment to a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo which contributes to the stability of the region and which adheres to the values and standards of the EU. I am convinced that an <Col N="1548"/>early resolution of the tragic issue of missing persons would not only ease the suffering of families across Kosovo, but make a significant contribution to the work of building a truly multi-ethnic society.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Applications for funding under the 2005 sports capital programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December 2004. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. All applications, including those from each of the clubs in question, are being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December last. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. All applications, including one from the club in question, are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland, including its regions and areas. IDA Ireland is committed to regional development as a core part of its strategy and has set itself a high level performance target for the Objective One, Border-Midlands and West, BMW, area. This commits IDA Ireland to try to achieve a target of 50% of all new greenfield jobs to be located in the Objective One area in the period 2000-06.</P>
        <P>The underlying process of creating new greenfield jobs in the Objective One area is initiated with first time site visits by overseas investors to the Objective One area. Commencing in 2000, it has been IDA Ireland&rsquo;s objective to direct 50% of all first-time site visits to the Objective One area. Following on from this, the expectation is that 50% of all new greenfield jobs created will be achieved in the Objective One area. Typically, new jobs on the ground come on stream within three to five years of approval.</P>
        <P>In this regard, substantial progress has been achieved to date. In 1999, prior to the start of the current NDP, about 25% of all new greenfield jobs were locating in the Objective One area, whereas in 2004 some 41% of all new greenfield jobs were located in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Despite difficult conditions on the global economic front in recent years and relatively slow progress with the roll-out of infrastructure in the Objective One, BMW area, strong progress towards the 50% target is being made and, as the above figures show, the share of new greenfield projects going to the Objective One area is substantially higher than was the case prior to the current NDP.</P>
        <P>While IDA Ireland continues to make every effort to maximise the proportion of new greenfield investment locating in the Objective One, BMW area through, <i>inter alia</i>, offering higher grant assistance it must be remembered that, in the final analysis, it is the investor who decides where to locate.</P>

	<P>Existing provision for pensions include pensions under the social insurance system which require a certain level of social insurance contributions and pensions under social assistance which depend on satisfying a means test.</P>
        <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These include extended social insurance coverage and an easing of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. The latter measures are of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.</P>
        <P>In 1997 the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes was reduced from 20 to ten and in 2000, a special half rate pension was introduced based on pre-1953 insurance contributions. <i>Pro-rata</i> pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension and a number of special increases have been given over several budgets in pursuit of this target. In addition, since October 2002, new pension claimants can opt to have the part of the payment in respect of their spouse or partner paid direct to that person.</P>
        <P>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. The scheme allows up to 20 years to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension as the standard qualifying conditions relating to the type and number of contributions paid or credited must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>The scheme is being reviewed as part of the second phase review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The review is due for completion in the next few months and developments in regard to the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the review.</P>
        <P>The old age non-contributory pension is a social assistance scheme designed to provide financial support for all older people, whatever their circumstances, who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes, it features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most <Col N="1557"/>in need. In this regard, budget 2005 provides for the disregard of the first &euro;20,000 of savings or other assessable assets such as shares or bonds when means are being assessed. The operation of the means test is kept under review and changes are made as required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Tackling child poverty continues to be one of the key priorities of this Government. It is also one of the special initiatives under the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. The Government recognises the importance of supporting and protecting families and children and is fully committed to achieving the NAPS target of eliminating consistent poverty amongst children.</P>
        <P>The most significant measure to tackle child poverty by my Department has been the substantial increases in child benefit payments. Between 1997 and April 2005, when the budget increases will take effect, the rate of child benefit will have risen from &euro;38.09 per month for the first two children and &euro;49.52 for each child thereafter to &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child.</P>
        <P>The family income supplement provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families, including lone parent families, at work on low pay. Improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In order to address the situation of those children most at risk of poverty, I am giving serious consideration to the introduction of a second tier of supports, in addition to the child benefit and other support entitlements, aimed specifically at families in greatest need. Linked to this particularly are the vulnerable circumstances of many lone parents, who are mostly women. The existing support systems will be scrutinised over the coming months and changes considered to better reflect the needs of this group. My Department is participating in an interdepartmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children. My Department is also involved in efforts to develop a strategy to eliminate obstacles to employment for lone parents.</P>
        <P>The causes of poverty among children and its effects are multi-faceted requiring a multi-policy <Col N="1558"/>response. The national action plan to combat poverty and social exclusion details these policies across a number of Government Departments. A wide range of data is required in effectively monitoring, evaluating and further developing such policies. It is for that reason that my Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the National Children&rsquo;s Office, are jointly funding a national longitudinal study on children. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study.</P>
        <P>The aim of the study is to examine the factors which contribute to, or undermine, the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families. The findings will make a major contribution to the setting of effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and their families. I expect that, following the completion of the tendering process, this study will commence in mid 2005.</P>

	<P>The areas included in the CL&Aacute;R programme are parts of counties Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath and all of County Leitrim. The 16 areas originally selected for inclusion in the CL&Aacute;R programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula which was included based on the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. The population loss in the areas ranged from 42% to 60% with an average population loss in the 16 areas of 50%. The aggregate population in each area was over 4,000.</P>
        <P>The methodology used in deciding the areas to be included was identification of the district electoral divisions, DEDs, which lost the most population in that period. However, so that the areas had some meaningful correlation with identifiable communities, the natural geographic features such as major lakes or the sea and other boundaries as well as DED boundaries were used. Given the nature of the exercise, in some cases the selected areas straddled two or more counties.</P>
        <P>Arising from the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, following an analysis of the 2002 population census data, the CL&Aacute;R areas were reviewed and extended. The exercise involved identifying and including any DEDs with a more than 50% population decline contiguous to existing CL&Aacute;R areas. In the case of Donegal, contiguity was taken to include contiguity across narrow inlets due to the extreme remoteness of the area and the unusual geography.</P>
        <P>In addition, the data were examined to establish if there were any other areas of the country where the appropriate population decline had occurred and matched the criterion of an aggregate population of over 4,000. The only county or part of a county non-contiguous to existing CL&Aacute;R areas that had significant pockets of population decline was Waterford. A decision was taken to include three pockets in Waterford with a total population of 5,100 and an average population decline of 47%. As a result, the programme <Col N="1562"/>now operates in areas in the 18 counties indicated at the outset.</P>

	<P>The modulated funds become available for use in 2006. I will decide on their use and seek the necessary EU approval in the coming months. Currently, my Department is finalising its examination of the relevant options. As part of that examination, there has been a widespread public consultation and discussions with stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The use of modulated funds in 2006 is limited to certain measures. The eligible measures are those in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, rural development plan &mdash; agri-environment, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry &mdash; and the new initiatives introduced as part of the CAP mid-term review &mdash; food quality, animal welfare, farm advisory services and meeting standards. My decision on the use of the funds will, of course, have to be informed by the terms and conditions of those measures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, was established under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988. Its function under the Act is to provide research, training and advisory services for the agri-food sector. Teagasc is governed by an 11 member authority. The chairman and five ordinary members are appointed by the Minister and the remaining five members are appointed by the Minister following nominations from designated organisations &mdash; IFA, ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme and Teagasc unions.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has 1,360 permanent staff, comprising advisers, teachers and research scientists with appropriate supporting services. These are complemented by some 250 contract staff, as well as teaching staff in the private agricultural and horticultural colleges. Teagasc staff carry out their functions from more than 90 locations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc&rsquo;s operating budget for 2005 amounts to over &euro;155 million. Advisory services make up the biggest budget item, 35% of expenditure, followed by production research, 32%, training programmes, 19%, and food research, 13%. My <Col N="1563"/>Department&rsquo;s provision to Teagasc for capital and non-capital purposes in 2005 amounts to &euro;123 million. The amount for non-capital purposes is &euro;118.5 million and for capital development purposes the allocation is &euro;4.5 million. By any standards these are substantial resources and are a clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Teagasc authority to prioritise activities and to allocate its funding accordingly. It has done this over the years in accordance with the needs of clients, EU and Government policy and industry needs. I am satisfied that in doing so it has provided a first class service to Irish farmers.</P>
        <P>In the short term Teagasc will have to reconfigure its programmes in response to the fundamental changes in agriculture arising out of the single payment. The authority is, however, already well accustomed to tailoring its programmes to meet the changing requirements of the agri food sector. Its annual programme of activities is developed in consultation with the key stakeholders in the sector, many of whom are represented on the authority. Recently, it has undertaken more strategic planning initiatives &mdash; the Teagasc 2000 review and the three year strategy required under the strategic management initiative. A new review of its training and education programmes has recently got under way.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Teagasc is well placed to face the future and to continue to provide the innovation and technology transfer for the sustainable development of agriculture, the food industry and rural communities in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted two applications under the 2004 EU special beef premium scheme, one dated 8 March 2004, in respect of 16 animals and one dated 6 December 2004, in respect of ten animals. Following computer validation it was found that ten of the 16 animals applied for on 8 March 2004 were not recorded on the CMMS database as being in the herd of the person named on the date of application. By letter dated 24 September 2004 the person named was advised that as the ten animals in question were non-CMMS compliant on the date of application for premium, no payment would be made on those animals and a penalty would be applied, in accordance with the terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>The person named subsequently appealed this decision and, by letter dated 7 February, following consideration of the appeal, the person <Col N="1564"/>named was informed that, while the ten animals would not be paid premium, no further penalty would apply. They must, however, be counted for stocking density purposes. The person has been advised of the right of appeal to the agricultural appeals office; to date, no such appeal has been lodged with that office.</P>

	<P>Under Community rules the importation of animal products which have already been incorporated within pet foods and which are destined for meat eating animals is provided for subject to certain conditions. Data supplied by the Central Statistics Office indicate that the total quantity of pet food imported into this country during 2003 was 42,753 tonnes and for 2004 a total of 31,120 tonnes has been imported for the period up to October.</P>
        <P>Importers of pet foods are required to register with my Department and give at least 24 hours notice of intention to import. Pet food originating from an EU source must come from an approved establishment and be accompanied to its destination with a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the member state of origin. In the case of importation from third countries it can only be imported under licence. In such cases, it must originate in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment and be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance the provisions of Community legislation.</P>

	<P>Significant progress was made towards a new WTO trade round with the framework agreement which was concluded in Geneva in August 2004. The main elements of the framework agreement can be summarised as follows: domestic support &mdash; a substantial reduction in the levels of trade-distorting domestic support, a ceiling on each WTO member&rsquo;s expenditure on direct payments to farmers under production-limiting programmes &mdash; blue box &mdash; and a review of payments or subsidies which have no or minimal trade-distorting effect &mdash; green box; market access &mdash; a substantial improvement in market access for all products through tariff reductions; higher tariffs will be subject to higher cuts, and WTO members may self-select a number of sensitive products for special treatment but all products will be subject to substantial improvements in market access through a combination of tariff cuts and tariff quota commitments; export subsidies &mdash; the phasing out in annual instalments by an end date to be agreed of all forms of export subsidies, including export refunds, export credits, with limited exceptions, the trade-distorting practices of state trading enterprises and food aid not in conformity with disciplines to be introduced; special and differential treatment or more favourable terms and conditions for developing countries will be an integral part of all elements of the new round.</P>
        <P>The framework agreement protects the benefits to the Irish agri-food sector of the recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy and represents a satisfactory outcome for Ireland. The full details of the implementation of the framework agreement are the subject of on-going negotiations in Geneva, leading to a WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will recall, January <Col N="1566"/>2001 saw the introduction by the EU of a total ban on the use of certain processed animal proteins, which includes mammalian meat and bonemeal, in the diets of farmed animals because of it being a probable cause of BSE. Ireland, in implementing this total ban and in recognition of the importance of the export trade, increased its level of sampling for processed animal proteins from 810 samples in 2000 to almost 3,500 in 2003 with that level maintained for 2004. This includes the sampling of all imported bulk consignments of feed materials, along with extensive sampling of compound feedstuffs and on farm sampling. Because of the importance attached to BSE, Ireland carries out significantly more testing and analysis of animal feed for the presence of processed animal proteins than the minimum indicated by the EU in their annual co-ordinated control programme.</P>
        <P>While I cannot guarantee that traces of bone will not be detected in animal feed in the future, I am satisfied that, first, the controls operated by my Department are adequate to ensure that any contamination is detected at the earliest possible stage in the feed chain and, second, the feed industry and the farming community take every possible precaution to ensure that mammalian meat and bone meal does not enter the feed chain. This diligence is evidenced by the fact that of the 7,000 or so samples of feed material analysed by my Department over the last two years, mammalian bone fragments have been detected in only four consignments.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular form below. The purchase for destruction scheme, PFD, ran from January to June 2001 and removed 278,000 animals of which 87,217 or 31% were cows. The PFD was followed closely by the special purchase scheme, SPS, which ran from June 2001 to March 2002. A total of 215,650 cows were slaughtered in Ireland under the SPS, representing 92% of the animals removed under this scheme.</P><Col N="1565"/>

	<P>Last year Ireland produced 560,000 tonnes of beef, the highest level of output since 2001. Some 88% or 493,000 tonnes was exported and the balance was consumed on the domestic market. The UK is the main export market for Irish beef and absorbed 264,000 tonnes in 2004. An additional 174,000 tonnes was exported to continental EU markets. The EU now comprises 90% of our total exports compared with 49% in 2000.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced internal EU marketplace. Effective promotion and marketing of beef by Bord Bia and the industry has ensured a presence for top quality Irish beef in all the key European markets. This includes supply arrangements with multiples and the main retailers in the UK, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>The overall approach in the marketing of Irish beef is to continually build on its reputation as a high quality and safety assured product based on a natural, extensive and well controlled cattle production sector at farm level. A strong interest in Irish beef has been generated by building it&rsquo;s reputation through the media, by chef&rsquo;s endorsements and the creation of demand from premium chefs and restaurants in each of these markets. The main goal of our marketing strategy is to increase retail market penetration and to invest in growing Irish beef awareness. This is being achieved by building relationships with key customers, product promotions and image building of the brand.</P>

	<P>The route to the food market for the Irish food industry is determined by its ability to compete in the marketplace and respond to consumer demand for quality, taste, nutrition and increasingly speciality products. Investment in marketing and market intelligence is crucial to success and on the supply side, world-class management and skills at production, processing and distribution stages is essential. While retailer concentration and central distribution are challenging for suppliers, globalisation of retailing has provided market-entry opportunities in the enlarged EU for Irish companies in a range of products including meat, dairy and beverage sectors. As regards being allowed to compete for contracts supplying the major chain stores, the Competition Authority has statutory responsibility in relation to any possible lack of access or unequal opportunity on the domestic market.</P>
        <P>My strategy and that of the State agencies is to underpin the ongoing success of the food sector by facilitating the industry to maintain competi<Col N="1569"/>tiveness and capacity to meet the demands of the market in terms of quality, convenience, price and product specification. The national development plan contains an indicative public funding allocation of &euro;358 million for the food industry by a series of measures covering capital investment, research, technology and innovation, marketing and promotion and human resources and some &euro;187 million has already been awarded under the various measures. Innovation and new product development are essential if food companies are to maintain competitiveness and market share and the national development plan funding in place is geared to assist the industry to produce what the consumer and the marketplace demands.</P>

	<P>Under harmonised EU legislation, a series of health and safety requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. Poultrymeat imported from third countries must meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in the EU. It must come from countries that have been approved for export to the EU and which have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, residues programmes, zoonoses controls and other food law.</P>
        <P>The meat must be sourced from establishments that have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments and that have effective control systems and are supervised by the competent authorities. Meat imported from other EU countries is produced to the same standards as in Ireland and in accordance with veterinary legislation designed to ensure its safety.</P>
        <P>A health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation must accompany poultrymeat being imported from third countries. All consignments must first be landed at an approved border inspection post and undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. Once it has been established that the meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Community. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-com<Col N="1570"/>pliance is established, they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>Safeguard measures to ensure the protection of human and animal health in the EU are introduced by the Commission as circumstances require. In this regard there are currently EU and national measures in place banning the importation of all live birds and fresh poultry meat from south east Asia because of the avian influenza situation in that region.</P>
        <P>My Department last year introduced legislation requiring country of origin labelling of poultrymeat imported from non-EU countries. The name of the country of origin must appear on packaging or, in the case of poultrymeat displayed loose, on a nearby notice. In addition, details of the grade-class of the poultry, price per kg, whether fresh or frozen and the registered number of the slaughterhouse or cutting plant where the product was last handled must also be provided.</P>
        <P>Consumers should be given maximum information on the origin of the food they are purchasing. I have this week along with other member states urged the Commission to examine EU labelling provisions to facilitate this, and in doing so, indicated the particular need for attention to be paid to the origin of poultry imports into the EU.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who will give effect to the national action programme under the directive by way of regulations. The provisions of the nitrates directive are among the statutory management requirements to be respected by farmers under the single payment scheme. My Department will inspect farmers for compliance as part of its controls under the single payment scheme. I have no plans to appoint additional staff in this area. I would point to the advisory work of Teagasc as being relevant in this context.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The tribunal also considers applications from producers whose herds have been restricted by animal disease, TB or brucellosis, during the quota year.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application on the grounds of animal disease in the 2003-04 year. The tribunal examined his application last March and recommended a temporary allocation of additional quota for the 2003-04 quota year. The allocations made are intended to mitigate to the greatest degree possible the impact of the levy where a producer is over quota due to restrictions imposed on selling surplus stock. However, it is not always possible to eliminate entirely a restricted supplier&rsquo;s levy liability and in this regard the tribunal must take account of a producer&rsquo;s supply pattern prior to the imposition of the restriction.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this stage to reduce the super levy bill for any producer for the 2003-04 milk quota year. However, if the person&rsquo;s herd was restricted in the current quota year he was entitled to apply again under the 2004-05 animal disease scheme. My Department has not received an application in the current year and accordingly the named person should make an application immediately to the tribunal if his herd has been restricted this quota year and he considers he will exceed his quota for the year.</P>

	<P>This matter received detailed consideration, first, during the policy formulation stage of the proposals leading to the Human Rights Commission Act 2000; second, at my meeting with the commission in April, 2004; and third, in the context of my responses, as approved by the Government on 6 July 2004, to the various recommendations put forward by the commission in its report on effectiveness prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 24 of that Act. Those recommendations are reproduced in appendix 9 of the commission&rsquo;s annual report for 2003, which has been published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 October 2004. The formal responses on this issue, as well as those relating to the other points raised by the commission, were also laid before both Houses on the same day.</P>
        <P>The commission&rsquo;s recommendation is that consideration should be given by the Government to linking the commission more closely to the Oireachtas in accountability for the exercise of its functions. The independence given to the commission under the legislation is underpinned by its wide mandate, remit and powers. It is not easy to see how aligning it with, say, a committee of the Oireachtas, would increase that independence or effectiveness. However, I indicated to the commission at the meeting I have referred to, that it was free to explore the issue further with a view to developing concrete proposals for my consideration. The commission has been examining the matter and I await its definitive suggestions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my responsibility as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and that of my Department, to maintain and enhance community security and equality through the development of a range of policies and high quality services which underpin, <i>inter alia</i>, an effective and balanced approach to crime. That balanced approach, in addition to providing the resources and legislative provisions, requires that I make available a range of options for disposal of cases.</P>
        <P>Addressing the root causes of crime is a multidimensional task, which falls within the areas of responsibility of a number of Departments. A number of risk factors have been identified as contributing factors to the causes of crime. These include neighbourhood and community factors; socioeconomic deprivation measured in part by poor housing and consistent poverty; family background-parenting; and individual factors such as lower than average IQ or low self-esteem and academic and school factors.</P>
        <P>My Department supports and develops evidence-based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending. One of these measures is the Garda youth diversion projects. They are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention, initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 currently, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of &euro;5.471 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year. The National Crime Council was established in 1999 and its key roles are to focus on crime prevention, with particular emphasis on the underlying causes of crime and focus on raising public awareness of crime; examine the &ldquo;fear of crime&rdquo;; identify research priorities and undertake in-house research.</P>
        <P>With regard to reducing the numbers of people serving prison sentences, under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the order being made. The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usu<Col N="1577"/>ally to be completed within 12 months. An offender may be rehabilitated through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime. The Probation and Welfare Service of my Department supervises those offenders undergoing community service orders.</P>
        <P>The making of a community service order is a matter entirely for the Judiciary and one in which I have no function. However, the courts have and do exercise wide discretion in using CSOs in dealing with people over 16 years of age who offend. It is used in practice for all age categories of offenders. Work projects are negotiated by the Probation and Welfare Service with a wide range of community and voluntary agencies, usually resulting from an approach by the agency but, when necessary, arising from an approach to an agency by the service. There are more than 70 such projects around the country. My Department will provide circa &euro;14.5 million to them in current funding this year. These projects offer a range of educational and training opportunities, counselling and substance abuse programmes. The Probation and Welfare Service is also in the process of identifying where there may be room for more projects servicing different needs around the country.</P>
        <P>The Children Act 2001 introduced a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Three Departments have a role in implementing the Act; my Department and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. The National Children&rsquo;s Office has the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the Act and co-ordinating regular working group meetings.</P>
        <P>It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>

	<P>The CONNECT project was launched in 2000 as part of the Irish Prison Service training and development programme. The funding involved is provided annually by the Exchequer as part of the prisons Vote. Expenditure since 2000 has gone mainly to funding salary and incidental costs incurred in providing vocational training in the prisons and the provision of support to the project by the National Training and Development Institute, or NTDI, as well as meeting the cost of some capital works and materials used in the manufacture of products in prison workshops for the Special Olympics in 2003. The CONNECT projects at Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and the training unit were established with the support of the NTDI and are now capable of independent operation. A process of internal review during 2002 prompted a refocusing of the project prior to its roll-out to further institutions. In particular, the review identified the need for new management structures to support the project&rsquo;s sentence management processes better in the delivering institutions.</P>
        <P>The CONNECT project is currently being rolled out at Limerick Prison with renewed NTDI support, and the projects at Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and the training unit, which have been affected by the current industrial relations and financial restrictions, will resume operations if and when there is a successful outcome to the current industrial relations process with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association. As the Deputy will be aware, members of that association will shortly be balloting on the proposal for organisational change recently concluded with the Irish Prison Service at the Labour Relations Commission following lengthy negotiations.</P>

	<P>The persons in question, along with their then seven year old daughter, arrived in the State in February 1999 and made asylum applications. They had an Irish-born child in December 1999, withdrew their asylum applications and applied for permission to remain on the basis of their parentage of that child. Permission to reside in the State was granted solely on that basis.</P>
        <P>The persons in question have no entitlement to Irish travel documents. They were previously issued with temporary travel documents as an exceptional measure which would have enabled them to travel to obtain their own passports. In June 2004 they sought a renewal of the travel documents, and they were advised to contact their nearest embassy or consulate with a view to obtaining their own national passports.</P>
        <P>Travel documents are never intended to be issued as a substitute for passports from a person&rsquo;s own country of nationality. However, in exceptional circumstances they can be issued in the event that a person has been unreasonably refused a passport from their country of origin. In this case no documentary evidence has been produced in order to demonstrate that the persons concerned cannot obtain a passport from their country of origin. It is still open to the persons in question to provide the necessary documentation to allow the application for the travel documents to be reconsidered on the exceptional basis.</P>

	<P>During summer 2004 my Department published a comprehensive review of progress under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06 entitled Developing Childcare In Ireland. The document was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and was also posted on the Department&rsquo;s website. Much of the information the Deputy is seeking, up to the end of 2003, is included in this report.</P>
        <P>It is intended in future to update these statistics twice yearly. The first such update, which will cover the period up to end of 2004, is expected to become available over the summer of 2005 and will be posted on the Department&rsquo;s website as well as being circulated to interested parties, including Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The overall position as regards County Cork is that up to the end of February 2005 I approved 269 grants, totalling &euro;30.2 million, in respect of capital, staffing and quality improvement projects across the county. It is anticipated that this funding will lead to the creation of over 3,400 new child care places and will support a further 3,100 existing places. This funding includes: over 60 capital grants for community-based or not-for-profit groups which were approved funding of &euro;13.4 million; over 80 community-based or not-for-profit projects which have received staffing funding of over &euro;10 million; over 60 grants to private sector child care projects which have been approved for funding of &euro;2.1 million; funding for Cork city and county child care committees to enable them to carry out their day-to-day activities and to deliver on their respective action plans. To date, over &euro;1.6 million has been made available for that purpose.</P>
        <P>Regarding the renewal of funding to projects, as the Deputy may be aware, the equal opportunities child care programme provides staffing grants to any community-based or not-for-profit child care services which can demonstrate a clear focus on disadvantage. Usually three years funding is provided under the programme to enable those projects to move towards self-sustainability. There will, of course, because of the nature of the families and communities that some of these services are supporting, always be a need for grant-aid for many of the groups that the programme is already supporting.</P>
        <P>In that respect my Department is currently reviewing the arrangements for the ongoing support of such services in very disadvantaged areas and plans to introduce new arrangements for funding groups for which the three-year funding envelope or any subsequent continuation funding becomes exhausted by 31 August 2005. Information regarding the introduction of those new arrangements, which will be effective from 1 <Col N="1581"/>September 2005, will be forwarded to the groups in question as soon as it is available.</P>
        <P>The relevant groups have been informed that their staffing funding will be continued at existing levels up to 31 August 2005, subject to the groups delivering their agreed levels of child care service provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that Balbriggan is a rapidly developing area and it is taking a number of measures to address this situation.</P>
        <P>Under the capital programme for 2005, sanction has been given for temporary accommodation at St. Molagas national school, Scoil Peadar agus P&oacute;l national school and St. George&rsquo;s national school to cater for increased enrolments for September 2005.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, an application for the establishment of a new primary school under the patronage of Educate Together is currently being assessed by the New Schools Advisory Committee. My Department is supporting this application, a decision on which will be given by mid-April next.</P>
        <P>With regard to future provision in the Balbriggan area, as the Deputy will be aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Balbriggan is included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall <Col N="1585"/>plan for the north Dublin-east Meath and south Louth area. The need for additional educational provision in the area will be considered in this context.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</P>
        <P>Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area, which will be the touchstone against which all decisions in relation to capital investment will be made for the next decade.</P>
        <P>The draft plan for north Dublin-east Meath and south Louth area is nearing completion in the school planning section of my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific issues referred to by the Deputy the position is that where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board has refused to enrol a student, section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>

        <Quest>if for the future she will approve the special needs teaching facilities and models in primary schools throughout County Kildare that are most suited to each particular schools requirements, having regard to children&rsquo;s needs and parents concerns; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
        <P>Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes-units attached to ordinary schools to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many children with such needs are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where <Col N="1586"/>necessary, of special resource teachers and-or special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are three special schools in operation in County Kildare at present catering for approximately 157 pupils with special needs with a pupil-teacher ratio ranging from 6:1 to 11:1. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>In addition to these special schools, I can confirm that the following special needs provision in County Kildare has been sanctioned by my Department to cater for the special educational needs, SEN, of pupils: nine special classes for pupils with autism at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; six special classes for pupils with mild general learning disabilities at a pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1; and one special class for pupils with moderate general learning disabilities at a pupil teacher ratio of 8:1.</P>
        <P>All special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with special educational needs attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and, in that way, benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding for The Saplings Project, a facility sanctioned on a pilot basis which uses applied behavioural analysis methodologies for children with autism. There are approximately 30 children enrolled in the facility.</P>
        <P>While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>In the light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.</P>
        <P>The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The logic behind having a general allocation <Col N="1587"/>model is to reduce the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments, and put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools, greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils&rsquo; special educational needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.</P>
        <P>As I have told the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions, I am very conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the model announced last year, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I am having the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting with representative interests including the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that I am in favour of using a general allocation model to ensure that we have in place a permanent resource in our primary schools to cater for pupils with high incidence mild disabilities and learning difficulties. However, it will not be as announced last year. The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks, in time to be implemented for the next school year.</P>
        <P>In the lower incidence disability categories resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications. It is important that where there is a particular and special need in the low incidence category these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the special education needs organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>
        <P>I am confident the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those in County Kildare, receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks, in time to be implemented for the next school year. A communication will issue to the school in question at that point. In the lower incidence disability categories, resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications.</P>
        <P>It is important that where there is a particular special need in the low incidence category that <Col N="1589"/>these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education and the special education needs organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child. Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes-units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</P><Col N="1590"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many children with such needs are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of special resource teachers and/or special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are 107 special schools in the country at present. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>Where placement in a special school is not considered necessary, children with special educational needs can attend special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools. All special classes enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with special educational needs attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and, in that way, benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers. While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>The following dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs in the primary system: more than 2,600 resource teachers &mdash; up from 104 in 1998; more than 1,500 learning support teachers &mdash; up from 1,302 in 1998; more than 1,000 teachers in special schools; more than 600 teachers in special classes; more than 5,000 special needs assistants &mdash; up from 300 in 1998; more than &euro;30 million on school transport for special needs pupils; more than &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials &mdash; up from &euro;800,000 in 1998.</P>
        <P>To appreciate the scale of improvement in the provision of resources to primary schools for special needs, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, at approximately 10,700, the number of adults providing services to children with special educational needs in primary schools today equates to more than half of the 21,100 primary teaching force in 1998.</P>
        <P>The level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs in the second level system has also grown significantly in recent years. In the current school year to date, my Department has allocated approximately 1,386 whole-time equivalent teachers and approximately 626 special needs assistants to second level schools and VECs to cater for the special educational needs of students at second level. This represents an increase of approximately 280 resource teacher <Col N="1591"/>posts and approximately 160 special needs assistant posts on the previous school year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs and, in particular, it is responsible for the following: deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; and deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources at primary and post-primary level and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a circular and letter advising the authorities of primary and post-primary schools respectively, of the arrangements put in place as a result of the transfer of these functions to the NCSE. My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs. The steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services. The enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act and the establishment of the NCSE have provided the key to underpin service delivery in the future.</P>

	<P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support <Col N="1592"/>students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.</P>
        <P>The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The logic behind having a general allocation model is to reduce the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools, greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils&rsquo; special needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.</P>
        <P>As I have informed the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions, I am, however, conscious of difficulties that could arise in respect of the model announced last year, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I am having the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting with representative interests including the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that I am in favour of using a general allocation model to ensure that we have in place a permanent resource in our primary schools to cater for pupils with high incidence mild disabilities and learning difficulties. However, it will not be as announced last year. The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks, in time to be implemented for the next school year. In the lower incidence disability categories, resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications.</P>
        <P>It is important that where there is a particular special need in the low incidence category that these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education and the special education needs organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>

	<P>In the case of secondary schools, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services under two separate schemes. The first of these is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in secondary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Pension scheme arrangements apply since 1985 to secretaries employed under this scheme. The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
        <P>The 1978-79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided. It has been a matter for the schools in question to determine such matters as to whether to employ one or more secretaries, the hours of employment, their pay and general terms and conditions. In the case of such employees, I understand secondary schools have been advised by their representative managerial body regarding the right of such employees to contribute to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs.</P>

	<P>The Local Government Act 2001 was designed to modernise the legislative framework, support community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy and underpin generally the programme of local government renewal, including the position of county and city councils as the primary units of local government. The Act takes account of the recommendations of the 1996 report of the reorganisation commission towards cohesive local government &mdash; town and county &mdash; regarding improved accessibility, interaction and linkages for non-local authority towns within county council areas. The commission&rsquo;s report stated that the existence of town authorities in a number of small towns is not in itself a premise on which to base a case for the creation of new authorities in all or any other towns of that size and concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that the widespread creation of new town authorities was neither warranted nor feasible. The report recommended that only towns with a population of 7,500 or over be eligible for consideration. In line with this, section 185 of that Act provides,<i> inter alia</i>, that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census or such other figure as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations, and not having a town council, may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council.</P>
        <P>The local government modernisation programme has seen local authorities respond to the need to decentralise service delivery through the provision of local area offices, substantial investment in e-local government with the use of on-line technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery, and the production of local authority customer action plans. In addition, the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that a local area plan must be prepared for all towns with a population of more than 2,000 that are not already planning authorities, thus ensuring that the citizens of smaller towns have a full opportunity to participate in the process of developing strategic priorities for their local areas.</P>
