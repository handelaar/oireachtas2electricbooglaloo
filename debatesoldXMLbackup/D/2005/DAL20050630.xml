    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the disgraceful situation concerning a young pupil with Down&rsquo;s syndrome assessed as having a mild disability, who was to start school in September 2005 in a class of 26 junior infants and who has been refused resource teaching hours; the need to ensure that this scandalous situation accords with disability legislation and the need to ensure appropriate education opportunities for this pupil and other pupils with disability. Within 24 hours of the Disability Bill being completed, it is an absolute disgrace&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate to go beyond the notice submitted to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a child with disability is being refused a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not use Standing Order 31 in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect a Cheann Comhairle, but just 24 hours after the Disability Bill passed through the Houses, a child with a disability has been refused a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the jailing of five innocent landowners from Rossport, County Mayo, who object to the proposed gas pipeline on health and safety grounds. They are trying to protect their lands, families and livelihoods, given that there are two alternative routes for the gas pipeline. One was stopped owing to cost implications or to save Shell some money. The other was stopped for <Col N="1498" />environmental reasons to preserve birds and plants but with no concern for residents.</P>
      <P>This project has been supported by the county council and Government and all the resources of the State were put behind it. The views and safety concerns of the residents were not taken into account although they will have to suffer the consequences of the proposed pipeline. I ask that we discuss this issue this morning. Five innocent men are in prison and we want these people out of prison. It is not right. There are people in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that Deputy McGrath went outside the Standing Order does not allow Deputy Ring to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Five of my constituents are in prison this morning while the people who should be in prison are not. Shame on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House, there are 11 Members with motions under Standing Order 31. The Standing Order is quite specific. A Member cannot go beyond the notice submitted to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the jailing of five landowners from County Mayo who have genuine health and safety concerns and who still await the publication of the independent quality risk assessment on the laying of that pipeline at Ballinaboy in County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene to seek a resolution of the dispute between local residents and the Shell oil company in north Mayo following the outrageous jailing of five local residents, and to ask the Minister to appoint urgently an independent arbitrator and to request the Shell oil company to waive immediately the court order which it sought to jail these five citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the restructuring of the Teagasc advisory service, which entails the closure and sale of many offices throughout the country at a time when the Minister of Agriculture and Food advises that finance for Teagasc is not a problem and when the Department returned &euro;383 million to the Department of Finance over recent years. Never before did farmers need so much advice to deal with the single payment system and the nitrates directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the jailing of five small landholders and residents in north Mayo at the behest of the Shell corporation; the fact that Shell <Col N="1499" />is allowed to lay a pipeline for raw natural gas without the risk assessment report on the project being published and debated, in advance of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources signs any consent order and before a comprehensive hearing on all the substantive issues in the High Court scheduled for the autumn; the need to debate why Corrib gas, a major natural resource off the west coast, should be handed over to a multinational corporation with not a penny in royalties for the people. That is absolutely disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the scandalous jailing of five Rossport residents who have been in mortal fear of their lives and the lives of their families due to the imposition of a potentially lethal gas pipeline on their lands and who have done no wrong except to assert their right to be left in peace in their own homes. I call the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to intervene urgently with Shell to ensure their immediate relief. This is utterly disgraceful. Those people should not be in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy not to take lessons from his colleague, Deputy Ring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister who should be in jail. Government Deputies will have to stand up and account for themselves. It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the disgraceful and unjustifiable circumstance in which eight inspectors visited one part-time farmer to evaluate his eligibility in respect of 48 acres of farmland under cross-compliance regulations. There is an immediate need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the reasons for this farcical state of affairs and give a commitment to the D&aacute;il that there will be no further such incidents. The Minister must provide that farmers will be given up to 14 days notice of on-farm inspections rather than subject to on-the-spot inspections which are both impractical, as many farmers work part time, and unwarranted, as inspections are based on farmland itself which cannot be tampered with no matter what the extent of the notification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter which was also raised on the Adjournment last night: the need for amended legislation and a prompt payment ombudsman to address the withholding of legitimate payments involving millions of euro by, in the main, certain large companies to subcontractors which continues to result in serious cash-flow problems for small and medium size businesses and which has <Col N="1500" />also caused the inexcusable intimidation of people who are themselves victims of non-payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the imprisonment of five men from Rossport, County Mayo as a result of their campaign simply to seek reassurance from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Shell Ireland Limited as to the safety of the proposed high-pressure gas pipeline carrying untreated and unpurified gas in bogland in close proximity to their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the jailing of five Mayo people on foot of their opposition to the routing of the Shell gas pipeline in north Mayo. I call on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to personally intervene in the impasse between the landowners concerned and the exploration company as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, how many Members does it take to have a matter of national importance discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has a problem with Standing Order 31, I will be glad to discuss it with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know how we can have the matter discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we cannot resolve the problem and the Members wish to change Standing Order 31, the Chair will implement the new Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, are there any circumstances in which you would concede to a request to move the adjournment under Standing Order 31? The matter in question can be revisited by Shell waiving its rights under the order and negotiating a simple resolution. The T&aacute;naiste should concede a few minutes during the day for Members to record the above as the wishes of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has studied the matter and is of the view that Standing Order 31 does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, can you facilitate Members?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it possible to allow a private notice question today to facilitate some discussion of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A private notice question submitted to the Office of the Ceann Comhairle will be considered in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House is agreed, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate that she will provide an hour to debate the matter during the day? There is spare time available as debates were shorter yesterday than expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Durkan, the Chair will give sympathetic consideration to a private notice question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you must change the formulation by which you dismiss all requests to move the adjournment stating that they are not in order under Standing Order 31. They are in order under Standing Order 31, but you decide to exercise your discretion not to allow a debate to happen. That should be reflected in the form of words used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has ruled on the matter and responded to Deputy Durkan that a private notice question will receive favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you will have to change the formulation you use because we are in order. It is your choice not to allow a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, if you are not satisfied with any Standing Order, you should arrange to have it changed. The Chair will be absolutely delighted to implement any new Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that anything raised under Standing Order 31 is a matter of national importance in the eyes of the person who raises it. It must also be in accordance with the terms of the Standing Order, however. We now move on to the Order of Business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be negligent of the House to pass the motions without debate given the extraordinary decision of the Minister for Health and Children not to introduce risk equalisation. Her decision is now being viewed as a capitulation to one insurer in the market. She has disregarded the advice of the Health Insurance Authority which was established by the House and is the expert body in this area. While the authority twice advised against risk equalisation, it has recommended on this occasion that it should be introduced to protect competition in the market. The T&aacute;naiste had indicated she would proceed on that basis, but has now decided otherwise. There is no clear explanation as to why she is abandoning for the moment a safeguard to the common good and individual subscribers, many of whom are now worried about the inevitable costs which will result from her failure to make a decision.</P>
      <P>I call for the allocation of an hour for a debate. We have spare time to permit proper debate and scrutiny of risk equalisation because the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill was concluded yesterday, even though time was provided for it today. The T&aacute;naiste must take the good advice she was given by the body established by this House to consider the matter. She has not explained adequately why she has done this and she has linked the status of the VHI to the lack of decision for which she is responsible. There is no connection. It does not make sense. As the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has pointed out, the net effect of what she has done is to continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a windfall profit of &euro;30 million to a British multinational that is subsidising its costs in Britain because of the high profits it is making here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made her point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ensure this matter is given public scrutiny so that people can know what is being done in their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support that. I also believe we should have a debate on risk equalisation. It is a very important issue that relates to community rating in the private insurance market. Many Members would like to make known their views on this. Up to this point, most of the debate on the matter has been within the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I fully support a debate in the House on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party also seeks such a debate. This omnibus approach to dealing with motions does not acknowledge that not only do they come from different Departments and are the responsibility of different Ministers, they also do not even get the basic acknowledgement that they stand on their own merits. I ask that they would be taken separately in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. Each of them will be taken separately. They will be put to the House separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Separately for the nod. I propose they be acknowledged as motions in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is purely a motion that they be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than happy to facilitate a debate on this matter. For the record, the Act that was brought in by Deputy Howlin when he was Minister for Health left discretion for this matter with the Minister for Health and Children. The Minister of the day used that discretion. I <Col N="1505" />took the advice of the advisers that had been appointed &mdash; Mercer &mdash; one of the leading actuarial companies, not only in Ireland but in Europe in regard to this matter. I would be very happy to have a debate, perhaps immediately after the Order of Business, but if that is not convenient for the Deputies, I am prepared to facilitate a debate for one hour.</P>

      <P>Under the Constitution, the Government is responsible to the D&aacute;il and one of the ways of exercising that accountability is through Leaders&rsquo; Questions. Yesterday the Taoiseach, in response to questions in the House, indicated that from his perspective the National Aquatic Centre was damaged by wind alone.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. To respond to Deputy Rabbitte, when I informed the House there was legal advice, I was wrong. It was not legal advice but other advice. It was not actually the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice but official advice on the difficulties that would arise if the whistleblowing legislation applied to companies outside Ireland with a subsidiary in Ireland. I am told the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends to bring proposals to the Government on this matter in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past three years, different Ministers and the Taoiseach have answered questions on the whistleblowers Bill on the basis that the law officer had advised that it was better to import it sectorally into various legislation. The T&aacute;naiste undertook to furnish me with that advice. She now tells me there was never any such advice and that officials had advised her. This confirms my view of this Government that there are some Ministers who sign anything and accept any kind of advice.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following scheme in draft:</P>
      <P LI="2">Risk Equalisation (Amendment) Scheme, 2005,</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">copies of which have been laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 15 June 2005.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of the three sets of regulations is to bring greater clarity to the reporting arrangement required by the health authority regarding <Col N="1514" />insurers. We discussed these matters at last week&rsquo;s committee and most members were in support. One of the regulations is consequential on my extension of insurance cover to persons over 65 years. Up until now insurers in the Irish market were not required to take on people over that age. This cover is subject to a period of two years, or 104 weeks, during which the person will not be able to claim cover except for an accident or something which is inflicted upon them, as opposed to something which might happen by virtue of their age or medical condition. This extension is to be welcomed. As a result of that, the regulation regarding minimum cover is necessary and the first regulation relates to greater clarity.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this morning&rsquo;s short debate is to deal with my decision regarding risk equalisation. Community rating, to which the Government is very strongly committed, is maintained under the Health Insurance Acts. I am a fan of community rating, which effectively means that, regardless of age or medical condition, people pay the same amount for the same policies. This has made insurance much more affordable to a large cross-section of the Irish community. Just less than 2 million people in this country have private health insurance.</P>
      <P>VHI has 80% of the private health insurance market, BUPA has between 19% and 20%; and VIVAS Health, the new entrant, has approximately 1%. The Minister for Health and Children is required to introduce risk equalisation. In fact, there is no option. The market equalisation percentage, MEP, must reach 10%, and one cannot introduce risk equalisation if the figure is below 2%. The MEP is the difference between what a particular insurer pays for people in different age categories and what the overall insurance market would pay if it had the same percentage of people in different age categories from the total number of people insured.</P>
      <P>When the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, reported on two previous occasions the MEP was 3.7% in the first instance and the authority recommended not to trigger risk equalisation. On the second occasion it was 3.5% and again the HIA recommended not to trigger risk equalisation. It was 4.7% on this occasion and the authority recommended that risk equalisation be introduced. However, in its report, the HIA stated that 0.7% of the 4.7% could be accounted for by one-off factors. BUPA does not have many customers who are over 80 years, but the average pay-out for people over that age is &euro;300,000 which the HIA considered to be an unusually high figure. Therefore it might have been a one-off and not representative of the sort of pay-out for people in that category. It could have distorted the figure by 0.7%. This is relevant in respect of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>VIVAS Health, a new company to the market, is required to put 50% of its premium income aside for reserves. VHI has no such requirement; it has a derogation, is protected and does not need to meet that market condition. A case is <Col N="1515" />being brought before the Irish courts by BUPA and another case is being brought to the European Court regarding that derogation. Other competitors in the market must meet a reserve requirement which is not required of the VHI. This is an unsatisfactory and untenable situation.</P>
      <P>I want to bring a memorandum to the Government in September with a view to moving towards full commercialisation of VHI. It will take some years before companies do not have such reserve requirements and are able to meet the requirements of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority which currently requires a reserve of 50%. This is particularly high when compared to the UK, where it is 20%, and Northern Ireland. We should have, at European level, a common figure for health insurers in terms of the reserve requirement. This factor clearly affects competition in the market, in particular that brought to bear by the new entrant.</P>
      <P>I remain a strong fan of risk equalisation and we cannot have community rating without it. It is not a question of whether we will do it but rather when.</P>
      <P>I am required by law, when I get a recommendation, to consult all the players in the market. In this instance, the players were VIVAS Health, VHI, BUPA and the ESB, who are part of the risk equalisation scheme. The Garda and prison officers&rsquo; scheme decided to opt out of risk equalisation when it was introduced. I am required to write a letter in a certain form, which might have led to the impression that I had made up my mind to do it. I am required before making my decision, notwithstanding the recommendation of the HIA, to consider all submissions made to me, which I did. I read them over the weekend and was particularly taken with some of the comments made by VIVAS Health.</P>
      <P>With regard to BUPA, if I was to be influenced by a lobby then the largest lobby is that with 1.5 million and not with 400,000. I am a member of VHI and would have had a particular interest. If a lobby was to affect my decision, it would have been the biggest and not the smallest lobby that did so. I was very much influenced by the comments made in the submissions.</P>
      <P>BUPA benefits from risk equalisation in Australia, which has 26 insurers for 8 million people. Ireland has 4 million people and 3 insurers. Until we have more insurers and better competition, we will not get the desired rates and innovation. The reality in many markets is that if there are only two players, they tend to track each other.</P>
      <P>VHI has some 150,000 more customers than it had before BUPA came into the market. More and more people are getting private health insurance and many joining today might not have considered it in the past but it is now part of their employment package. This is a welcome development because it extends private health insurance to a new category of customer.</P>
      <P>The Minister is required to take advice and a number of years ago the Department of Health <Col N="1516" />and Children appointed Mercer, a leading international actuary firm. The advice is always balanced, and there are very strong reasons to do it and also not to do it. Mercer advised me, on balance, not to do it and I am prepared to make its advice available. I also had the advice of the HIA and my own advisors. This is a close call and could go either way. However, we have not even achieved half the rate in terms of the MEP required to make it mandatory to introduce risk equalisation. The Minister has no option when the MEP reaches 10%. We are only at 4.7%, 0.7% of which might be one-off factors.</P>
      <P>These are the reasons behind my decision and people should not say there is no link with commercialisation of VHI. Risk equalisation is important to maintain competition and community rating. It is also necessary for all players to have the same reserve requirement. Otherwise the market is distorted. It is clearly unfair if one company must put aside 50% of its premium income into a reserve fund each year and the dominant market player is not required to do so. That is why there is a link with it being necessary for VHI to move towards commercialisation.</P>
      <P>VHI has a travel insurance product which is only available to its own members. One cannot join that scheme if one is not a VHI private health insurance subscriber. This is a huge advantage for the 1.5 million people who are able to avail of the product which is not available to its competitors. VHI requires the Minister&rsquo;s approval to go into new areas of business. I want it to have commercial autonomy so it can make whatever decisions it wishes. I want a healthy, vibrant health insurance market in Ireland and we can have it. However, we need more players.</P>
      <P>Once triggered, it is impossible to turn back the clock on risk equalisation. If I trigger it, VIVAS Health will have to come into risk equalisation in three years&rsquo; time, as would any new entrant to the market. They have three free years. Therefore, we must ensure we are getting it right before triggering something that we know will have a major impact on the market. The HIA said in its report that if I did not trigger risk equalisation, that would not have a major adverse effect on the market. If it was not going to cause instability in the market, clearly I would have done it.</P>
      <P>VHI made more profit last year &mdash; over &euro;77 million &mdash; than it did when it operated in the market on its own. That is a fact. We have a healthy insurance market and I want to maintain that. On this occasion I decided not to trigger risk equalisation. However, that does not mean it might not be done in six months or a year from now. The HIA is required to report to me in six months. There is also a case before the courts where some of these issues will be dealt with and that was clear from our discussions last week. The court has stated the Minister for Health and Children could fulfil her obligations but no payment could be made until it determines the outcome of the case. Therefore, even if I had made a determination to trigger risk equalisation, no money <Col N="1517" />could have transferred from BUPA to VHI and the ESB until such time as the High Court had made a determination on the proceedings before it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped this debate could have taken place later in the day so other Members could contribute their views, rather than just the main party spokespersons talking about the issue again.</P>
      <P>I fully understand that risk equalisation is part of community rating, which is vital for the private health insurance market as it exists in this country at present. However, there is a total lack of clarity in what is taking place. I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste will furnish us with the advice that she received to clarify how she made up her mind on this issue. The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for VHI and the HIA and the latter makes the decision on whether risk equalisation should be activated. Therefore, it is very important that there is transparency and accountability with regard to this, when the Minister has responsibility for both parties, one of which is making the decision and the other is affected by it.</P>
      <P>What are we doing to improve competition? That is an issue that has been missed in these discussions. One of the major issues being discussed this week, outside the House, by people who have private health insurance is the future development of the health insurance market and how it will affect them. One of the certainties people know is they are facing far higher costs than those they have been exposed to in the recent past. Since 1997, VHI premiums have doubled for the average customer. Much of that increase can be accounted for by medical and ordinary inflation factors, for which allowances must be made. However, indications are that medical inflation will increase even more dramatically in the future, especially regarding diagnostics, where cost increases will be significant. This means private health insurance will become very expensive unless something changes in the next few years. What is the Oireachtas planning to do about this? What is the Minister for Health and Children planning to do regarding the future and competition in the market? If nothing is done, people will be squeezed out of the private health insurance market, especially elderly people, because they find it most difficult to make premium payments. Usually, it is people over 65 who need health insurance more than others. Yet, when people retire at 65, they lose the benefits of occupational private health insurance and must pay their own premiums. While one can say that with community rating, a person over 65 is paying the same premium as a person who is 35, if the costs get out of control, the person over 65 will simply not be able to afford the payment. This issue must be examined, apart from the issues of risk equalisation and community rating.</P>
      <P>Hospital charges are as opaque, in some respects, as Government thinking. When this debate began, several people contacted me. They <Col N="1518" />were not overly concerned with risk equalisation. They were more concerned about the bills they received from hospital, the bills that are sent to VHI. People said that it was almost impossible to figure out for what they were being charged. There is no clarity in the bills that are sent to VHI. It is easy for the hospitals to state the bills reflect their contract with VHI. However, when these bills are analysed and a comparison of the breakdown costs is made with other European countries &mdash; a comparison made much easier by the euro &mdash; the result is amazing. One can allow for the fact that different health services are cheaper to run. The T&aacute;naiste has often made the point that it is much cheaper to look after people in the United Kingdom than here. Staff are paid differently and there are other variable cost factors at play. However, making a direct comparison of our hospital charges with those in other European countries including the United Kingdom is very enlightening. This is an issue that the T&aacute;naiste should take up, namely the costs to VHI, because rising costs are driving up premiums, as reflected in the bills submitted by hospitals. Every subscriber should demand a detailed breakdown of his or her bill. Then we might see hospitals taking more control of their costs.</P>
      <P>Risk equalisation was debated by the Joint Committee on Health and Children. In Australia, risk equalisation only kicks in with regard to people who are over 65. It does not apply to the whole market. As we also know from previous Oireachtas debates, the midpoint in terms of community rating is 40, that is, people who are under 40 are paying for those who are over that age. People in their 40s benefit very little but as they get older, the benefits from community rated private health insurance increase substantially. It is only for those over 65 that risk equalisation applies in Australia and so much of our private health insurance market is based on the Australian model. When VHI was established in 1957, it was based on the model that existed in Australia at that time. We have also followed many of the changes the Australians have made since then.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste should publish the report from the HIA to which she referred. We need clarity as to what is taking place. VHI can make a very strong case for itself, but at the same time, it controls 80% of the market. There is little or no competition in this market. An argument that has been used against BUPA is that while it only has a small percentage of the market, its profits are substantial, running into double-digit percentages. People are saying that BUPA is simply dovetailing VHI charges. Furthermore, when it comes to the charges and products offered by the companies, it is very difficult for customers to work out the benefits of each policy. One company, for example, has almost 30 different products. We should seek more streamlining in this area and this is part of the responsibility of Government. The Government can initiate public <Col N="1519" />information campaigns to help people to cut through all the red tape and it can put pressure on the insurance companies to be more transparent for the benefit of customers so people know what they are buying.</P>
      <P>The charge made by VHI against the new entrants to the market is that they are directing their marketing and advertising towards younger people so they can maximise their profits. Companies are making significant charges against each other and the State is getting embroiled in the case that BUPA is taking to the European Court. We need to have a much wider debate and I had hoped for that today.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste is correct about one thing, that is, a substantial number of people are affected by this, given the fact that 1.6 million to 2 million people in this country have some form of private health insurance. A substantial number of people will see costs increase. If the costs increase, the people who most need private health insurance, that is those on marginal incomes and the elderly, will find they cannot afford it. If costs to the markets increase dramatically, then there is no competition and the latter is important to make the system work. We must ask ourselves why, after so many years, there is still only one major new entrant in the market. The other entrant, VIVAS Health, only has 1% of the market and no other company is interested in entering the market. We should find out why that is the case. It is an extremely important issue that demands a much wider debate than that allowed for this morning.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about risk equalisation, competition in the market, the costs of the products and the costs to the consumer in the future. I was hoping we could have a much wider debate on these issues in the House but perhaps we can do so at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the T&aacute;naiste for enabling this short and rather hurried debate. It would have been negligent on the part of the House if it had not afforded the proposal some scrutiny, albeit without proper preparation. This is an important issue precipitated by the lack of decision shown by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children which has concerned and mystified many people. There is a perception that she has capitulated to the strong and over-the-top lobbying from one particular insurer.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time risk equalisation has been put on the long finger but it is the first time it has been so starkly rejected. The Minister has clearly decided not to take the best expert advice available through the Health Insurance Authority. The likely effect is increased costs to the subscriber and a certain risk to older subscribers or people looking to take out health insurance who will now become the undesirables in the market. Many older people who are terrified of being left waiting for necessary health care are <Col N="1520" />taking out health insurance to protect themselves and are now looking at their situation with some trepidation. The situation of the care of the elderly since the T&aacute;naiste has taken office has been very disturbing for older people, both in terms of illegal charges and the scandal of conditions in private nursing homes. Now the safeguard which should be in place to protect them is not being provided by the Minister nor is it being explained in any coherent way.</P>
      <P>Community rating has been a basic pillar of health insurance along with open enrolment and lifetime cover. The situation in this country is extraordinary in that 50% of the population is covered by health insurance and it is a significant feature of the health service. This is unlike other countries where people take out private health insurance, not because they want to protect themselves and to access care but because they desire the frills. In this country the health service is so defective, underdeveloped and poorly managed that people are protecting themselves by taking out health insurance to this extraordinary degree.</P>
      <P>Risk equalisation is a necessary part of the way our health insurance system operates. It provides the necessary balance within the market and it is anti-competitive not to introduce it when it is required of us. This is not a pro-competition argument but it seems to be some kind of ideological position that the Minister for Health and Children has adopted to which I have listened to time and again at the Joint Committee on Health and Children. The Prorgressive Democrats spokesperson on the committee seems to think that anything is better than risk equalisation. It is as if she has a visceral repugnance to the idea of risk equalisation, even to the point where she has argued that older subscribers should be forced to move from their insurer of choice to another insurer. The idea being floated by the Progressive Democrats is that it would somehow be better to force patients and subscribers to move rather than to introduce a measure that has been tried and trusted elsewhere and is part of the way we have approached health insurance for a long time.</P>
      <P>The net effect of the failure to introduce this measure when it is required or at least recommended by the authority, is the continuation of a windfall profit for BUPA of approximately &euro;30 million. This is a British multinational which, as far as can be ascertained because it does not provide a great deal of information about its accounts, can ensure its massive Irish profits are transferred to Britain where its profits are not so good because of a different regime.</P>
      <P>Risk equalisation was introduced in Ireland in 1996. BUPA entered the Irish market knowing the rules of the game. I find it very difficult to accept any validity in the argument when this is the case that BUPA started talking about pulling out of Ireland altogether. The initial blackmail was that it would pull up its roots and leave. The people working in its office in Fermoy must have been very disturbed by that statement but I sus<Col N="1521" />pect they saw it as a blackmail threat without any validity.</P>
      <P>Risk equalisation exists for a good reason. It has been recommended by the Health Insurance Authority whose report to the Minister I ask her to publish. I do not accept that Mercer has a higher level of wisdom and knowledge. Mercer is a private consultancy firm advising the Minister and the House should be allowed see the report. The Health Insurance Authority was established by this House, the national Parliament, to act as the supreme body to ensure a decision made by a Minister was an informed one and that the very best advice was being given.</P>
      <P>A competitive health insurance market with community rating and open enrolment would be unsustainable without risk equalisation. I know the Minister will say she believes in risk equalisation but it is very difficult to have any belief in that statement. She seems to be asking the House not to worry and to trust her judgment, but this is not really good enough because it has no substance and is ephemeral. One can only judge Ministers by their actions on difficult decisions and we are to understand that this is such a decision. However, it is not good enough to state that risk equalisation may be introduced at some point in the future. At that point there may be real problems created by this long delay. I do not have a problem with the delays in the past but the authority has now made a recommendation and the Minister persists in ignoring it.</P>
      <P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s press release on the subject. Initially there was a much tighter requirement for risk equalisation and had this original requirement of 2% and more than 2% been maintained, then risk equalisation might have been recommended much earlier. Following consideration and consultation, changes were made which benefited BUPA quite considerably and also helped Vivas Health to set up. In the original legislation the timeframe for the introduction of risk equalisation was much shorter. The Minister has disregarded all this and history began when she took over. She is now taking advice from private consultants in the commercial arena and is disregarding an authority whose remit is to protect the common good.</P>
      <P>I have problems with this policy and I challenge it. Even in her own terms of arguing that she stands for competition in the market, she is not able to sustain what she has done. Community rating is a distortion in the market, it is something we all understand and it already exists. Insurers with a large number of older subscribers are at a disadvantage because of community rating. It remains hidden in a monopoly because when there is a monopoly there is only one community. As a result of EU pressure, guidance and encouragement, we have a number of competitors in this area. Once there is community rating and competition, the antidote to the distortion created by community rating must be introduced, namely risk equalisation. For community rating to survive, there are only two situations that are viable. <Col N="1522" />One is a monopoly supplier of health insurance, which will not occur unless the Minister persists on this route and it may well end up that we would have a new monopoly. The other possibility is competition among insurers plus a risk equalisation fund. Risk equalisation benefits any insurer. It is not that it would benefit the VHI, BUPA or VIVAS Health. It benefits any insurer that has a disproportionate number of older subscribers. BUPA has benefited in Australia for that reason. That is what this is all about and it is not the case that anybody has a problem with that.</P>
      <P>Where there is community rating and competition but no risk equalisation fund, the market will always move to create a new monopoly. Community rating has survived only because VHI Healthcare has agreed to pass on to its members higher price increases that were warranted by reference to the community as a whole. This situation arose because VHI Healthcare has had a higher age profile of members than BUPA and now VIVAS Health. These higher prices have effectively financed the huge windfall profits for BUPA and this is a national scandal. That is what is happening. It is not that failure to introduce risk equalisation has no effect &mdash; significant profits are being generated to one insurer as a result of its preferential status.</P>
      <P>BUPA has fought a tremendous fight on this and one could not take from its commitment to destroy and prevent risk equalisation from being introduced. It has been very focused and effective. According to the Minister&rsquo;s public statement in January 2003, Irish authorities formally notified the EU Commission of the risk equalisation scheme. This notification was on foot of a complaint made by BUPA Ireland to the EU Commission that risk equalisation constituted an illegal State aid. The Directorate General for competition at the EU Commission notified the Irish authorities in May 2003 that it decided not to raise objections to the scheme on State aid grounds. It recognised the importance of risk equalisation. It does not see this as an interference in the market but sees it for what it is, namely, a measure to rebalance a distortion in the market that arises because of community rating, which is a protection for the common good, something which is universally subscribed to and supported across this House. The EU Commission understands the importance of risk equalisation. That is further evidence that this issue is not being dealt with fairly and properly in the interests of the common good and the individual subscriber.</P>
      <P>The Minister has used the argument about the VHI not needing to have reserves. The EU Commission does not have a problem with that.</P>

      <P>Until there is some change we have to accept that there is a recognition at Euro<Col N="1523" />pean level that health insurance is not like buying a bag of potatoes in a supermarket. Health insurance provides certain safeguards. The provision of health care is treated differently from viewing it in a crude, simplistic way, an approach that comes from the Progressive Democrats whereby everything must be seen in terms of pure competition. They view health care as another commodity. It does not matter to them what we are buying and selling here, what matters is that everybody can get into the market and sell and buy as cheaply as possible. However, health insurance has been recognised for decades by the European Union and other European countries as a central part of health care provision. I would like everybody in this country to have the protection of health insurance because if one can afford to buy health insurance, one is in a much better position to access health care. The system responds and is incentivised to look after subscribers. There are strong arguments to extending health insurance to everybody and enabling people to have the kind of care that currently only private patients are able to access when they need it. There is strong arguments for health insurance as a social measure of health care provision and that is recognised at EU level. If we simply see provision in this regard as buying and selling commodities on the market, the Minister is not getting the message. If she applies rules that do not accept that community rating is a distortion, that risk equalisation is a balancing measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude on this point. As regards the idea that the corporate status of the VHI will determine risk equalisation, we have been waiting for years for that legislation and according to the Minister&rsquo;s admission we will have to wait more years before it is implemented. Does that mean we will have to wait for years for risk equalisation to be introduced or does it mean there will be a change of heart in terms of meeting the needs of people and ensuring fair play in the health insurance market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I pass on apologies from Deputy Gormley, our health spokesperson, who has to be in Dublin Castle to meet Commissioner Barroso. I have spoken to him and discussed some of the experience he has had on the Joint Committee on Health and Children which he has asked me to relate. The Green Party believes in community rating and accepts the advice of the regulatory body on risk equalisation, which is supported in name by Government but we have yet to see the action to give effect to that. I heard the T&aacute;naiste relate that she regarded as a good phenomenon that more people were now reliant on private health insurance but I argue that indicates that more people are extremely nervous about <Col N="1524" />depending on the public health system. It indicates the public health system does not meet the standard people expect it to deliver. There is also a growing fear that people will require the services of hospitals and the health system more than they would want and I accept that nobody wants to go to hospital. People read about and experience an increasing incidence of asthma, cancer or other conditions or diseases and they may need to make provision for hospitalisation and health care more than they would otherwise be likely to do.</P>
      <P>The problem of a two-tier health system has not been addressed by the Government. The gap is growing between the reliance on private health insurance and the public health system. We need to examine the rising cost of the health insurance premiums. It is often mentioned that medical inflation is some type of runaway phenomenon that is a creature unto itself but that must be addressed. The T&aacute;naiste as Minister for Health and Children has far wider responsibilities than the health insurance companies, the role of which essentially is to service the needs of people who are sick.</P>
      <P>We need to see about other factors which may be affecting the cost of the provision of health services, not least health insurance companies. I would instance asthma, for example. Dietary related issues have been mentioned in this House, but have not been given sufficient attention. Obesity, in particular, is one matter which is getting a considerable amount of debate outside this House. Such conditions might be addressed from a multi-disciplinary perspective with a possible role for interdepartmental action. We have seen the difficulties experienced in the Department of Education and Science as regards the provision of physical education facilities, the lack of playgrounds, skate parks etc., which encroached on the responsibilities of other Departments. Basically, the problems most often referred to as obesogenic &mdash; environmental problems &mdash; will impact on the cost of health premiums because of the demand for health care services.</P>
      <P>A far more holistic view needs to be taken as regards the cost of health insurance so that effectively there is not such a burden of cost on the individual citizen, regardless of whether they are taxpayers, when it comes to health matters. I ask the Minister, on the basis that we are accepting risk equalisation, to proceed quickly to ensure that the fund is in place and that there will be practical implementation of the legislation as the current frustrating delay is causing more and more people to find refuge in health insurance. This is because they do not feel confident that either the Government or the public health sector are able to address their needs. Those needs are perceived to be growing, particularly for people who are in need of hospitalisation. Those people are very nervous that if they do not have private health insurance they will be much the poorer in terms of their health as they wait for services which they are entitled to as citizens. They are <Col N="1525" />promised such services in theory, but in practice those promises are not met.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this debate and appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has taken it at short notice, I ask that we proceed very quickly to ensure that risk equalisation becomes a practical reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to reject the Health Insurance Authority&rsquo;s recommendation on the introduction of risk equalisation is based purely on her ideological outlook. Risk equalisation is necessary to reflect the older age profile of VHI membership. The Health Insurance Authority recommended the introduction of risk equalisation in light of the damage being done to VHI under the current regime. It concluded that consumers would be better served by the lower premiums that would flow from risk equalisation. Given that the Health Insurance Authority is in place to advise the Minister on these issues, why did she consider it necessary to hire private consultants on this issue? Was it simply because she knew they would give her the results she wanted? I believe so.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s decision is based on her desire to undermine the VHI. I would be interested to know the extent of the representations made to the T&aacute;naiste by BUPA and Vivas Health on this matter. This is a clear case of the Progressive Democrats rampage against State companies, and the VHI is the victim in this instance. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s actions are likely to lead to an increase in premiums as VHI faces the continued loss of younger members to BUPA. The failure to introduce risk equalisation has the potential to irreparably damage the VHI as it enters a spiral of rising premiums and claims. In the absence of risk equalisation, certain insurers can concentrate on targeting lower risk individuals.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that the Health Insurance Authority took into account the commercial status of the VHI when arriving at its recommendation that unbalanced risk equalisation should be implemented. This undermines the claims made by the T&aacute;naiste to justify her failure to introduce risk equalisation. Her decision is scandalous and totally unjustifiable. The boom in the numbers of people taking up health insurance is indicative of the abject failure of the Government to reform the health service, ensuring equal and proper access for all. The people of this State already pay over the odds for health care. We pay for it through PRSI and the additional health levy. On top of this we pay for every visit to a GP and 50% of us pay for private insurance as well.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste said that she welcomes this statistic. She should because it is the Government&rsquo;s policy, in particular the long waiting lists, that have driven people into the arms of private insurers. The decision not to implement risk equalisation will only result in a further increase in the cost of health care. Fundamentally my party believes that health care is incompatible with the market. We believe in free health care <Col N="1526" />at the point of delivery based on need, not ability to pay. We believe it is the responsibility of Government to provide health services through the general taxation system. Health care should never be a commodity to be bought and sold. It should be a right. There is no logical reason for the delay in implementing risk equalisation. The T&aacute;naiste has admitted it is inevitable. The delay is purely ideological, facilitating private companies, particularly BUPA, giving it a commercial advantage over VHI. Proper modern facilities provided by the State are the best way to level the private health insurance field.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the opportunity the House has been given to address this motion, however condensed. It is welcome, nonetheless, and I hope the debate goes some way towards highlighting for the public the madness that exists as regards this entire question.</P>

      <P>More and more people have taken out private health insurance. The fact that the figure now stands at 52% or 53% of the population, or 1.9 million taking into account the VHI, BUPA, VIVAS Health and ESB, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and prison officers&rsquo; schemes, is good. It is a sign of increasing disposable income. That is mainly the reason more and more people have joined.</P>
      <P>Everybody, notwithstanding whether they have private health insurance, is fully entitled to all the facilities of the public hospital system. It is Government policy to charge insurers the full economic cost of private beds in public hospitals.</P>

      <P>It is happening. I increased it by 50% last year in the Estimates and it will be increased again this year. That will add to the cost of insurance, no doubt, but it is the right thing to do. The public hospital system should not have to subsidise private health insurance. It is disingenuous of Deputies to say we introduced legislation in the Oireachtas that said, in effect, if the market equalisation is 10%, risk equalisation must be introduced, if it is below 2% it cannot be introduced and if it is somewhere in between, it is introduced at the recommendation of the HIA, but at the discretion of the Minister. The Oireachtas gave the Minister of Health and Children that function. It did not say the HIA will decide when we introduce risk equalisation. It says the Minister cannot introduce it unless he or she gets a recommendation to do so. However, even if one receives such a recommendation, one is required by law to go through a certain process of consultation with those who will be affected, which I did.</P>
      <P>It is not correct that the position with regard to a reserve does not matter. If another Irish company must meet a reserve requirement and put 50% of its premium income into a reserve fund, <Col N="1527" />is it fair that another company, which has 80% of the market, is not subject to the same requirement? Although this matter has not yet been adjudicated on in Europe, regardless of what decision is taken on the matter in Europe, the current position is not fair and distorts the market. If a new company which entered the market recently offering innovative products must put aside 50% of its premium income to meet the requirements of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the body which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">

      <P>The VHI must do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case. The VHI has a derogation and is protected which is precisely what I seek to end. It will take some time to do so.</P>
      <P>I remain a strong fan of risk equalisation, without which one cannot have community rating. It is not a question of whether we will introduce it but when we will do so. I have considered all relevant issues, the submissions made by those affected, the advice of Mercer and the advice of my officials in the Department who advised that there were strong reasons for and against introducing risk equalisation but that, on balance, it should not be introduced on this occasion. As I stated, once we trigger risk equalisation, it is difficult to turn back the clock. These are some of the reasons that, having received advice, I decided not to do so.</P>
      <P>The worst that could happen in the health insurance market would be a return to a position of having no competitors. With regard to BUPA, even if the company were to leave the Irish market, I have no doubt it would sell its business to somebody else because 400,000 customers is a considerable business. I never bought into the view that if a particular company decided to exit the market, its customers would not be bought by somebody else given that the prospect of having 400,000 customers is an attractive proposition.</P>
      <P>It is also true that BUPA makes substantially more money in the Irish market than in the United Kingdom because we do not yet have real competition. Health insurers generally make in the region of 7% profit, whereas I understand the figure for BUPA&rsquo;s operations here is in the region of 15% to 17%. Profit, therefore, was not among the issues I took into account. These were competition, a strong submission from Vivas Health and the advice I was given. As I stated, the question is not whether we will have risk equalisation but when we will have it. Risk equalisation is inevitable and must in any case be triggered if one reaches the market equalisation percentage, MEP, of 10%. I assure the House I have no plans to change the relevant legislation in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P el="0">There are a number of amendments in this group, all of which relate to the Office of the Houses of Oireachtas Commission. For the <Col N="1529" />most part, the amendments proposed are technical and arise out of amendment No. 4. The purpose of the amendments is to clarify dismissal arrangements for staff in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. I will explain the background to the amendments.</P>
      <P>Currently, section 14 of the Bill amends section 20 of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959. As drafted, the section provides that the dismissing authority for all officers at principal officer level and above in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall be the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and for all officers below principal officer level shall be the Secretary General of that office. This is in line with the general principles of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 14 does not currently amend the provisions in section 20 of the 1959 Act relating to the dismissal of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard. In these cases the dismissing authority is still the Government, following a process of consultation with the relevant chairman and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. This provision is not fully in line with the central principles in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, I propose a new Part 3 of the Bill to address the matter by bringing together a number of amendments on the Houses of the Oireachtas and the commission. In light of the new devolved dismissal arrangements envisaged in the Bill, it would be inconsistent with the independence of the Houses to have the Government as the appropriate dismissing authority for the officers in question. The amendment will not result in a significant change in the current policy in the Bill but will instead retain certain protections set out in the 1959 and 2003 Acts which relate to the dismissal of Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment I propose will be to retain the current safeguards set out in the 1959 and 2003 Acts which provide that the dismissal of these officers can only take place after a process of consultation, while at the same time linking the principle of devolved authority, which is one of the central provisions of the amendment Bill. In line with the provisions of the Bill, the responsibility for dismissal will be devolved to the Minister responsible for appointing a successor, who in the case of these officers is the Taoiseach. The practical effect of the amendment will be that the Government can assign the authority to dismiss the Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad and of the D&aacute;il to the Taoiseach who may act on the recommendation of the Cathaoirleach or the Ceann Comhairle, as the case may be, following consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</P>
      <Col N="1530" />
      <P>In the cases of the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard, the dismissing authority will again be the Taoiseach, after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the commission. The rationale for assigning the responsibility to the Taoiseach comes from the fact that the Taoiseach, following a similar process of consultation, is also the appointing authority for each of these officers. This is consistent with the provision in section 7 of the Bill where the Government can assign the dismissing authority to the Minister who has the power of appointing a successor to that civil servant.</P>
      <P>No change is proposed in regard to other officers within the Oireachtas, other than that the arrangements for them will reflect the new devolved management structures elsewhere in the Civil Service. This will mean that officers at principal officer level and above will be dismissible by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission &mdash; the relevant &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act &mdash; on receipt of a recommendation from the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, while officers below that level will be dismissible by the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>A consequential amendment arising out of the new part in the Bill is to ensure that the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is treated in the same way as other Secretaries General for the purposes of the Act. Section 10 of the Bill currently amends section 15(6) of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 to provide that officers either holding a position to which they were appointed by the Government or holding a position as a Revenue Commissioner are not subject to the disciplinary sanctions set out in section 15.</P>
      <P>Under the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959 and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas is appointed by the Taoiseach on the recommendation of the chairman after consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</P>
      <P>The office holder is therefore not automatically excluded from the provisions of section 15 in the way other Secretaries General are.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are technical and provide in section 15(6) of the Act for the explicit exclusion of the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the measures set out in that action. This provision will ensure all Secretaries General are treated in a similar manner. Amendment No. 4 will give effect to the arrangements for dismissals in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas that I have outlined. This amendment will insert a new Part 3 to the Bill. The remainder of the amendments in this group are technical and give effect to the provisions I have set out.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to delete section 14 of the Bill. This section provides that the dismissal of a member of staff at principal officer grade or above shall only be on the recommendation of <Col N="1531" />the Secretary General. This provision is now replicated as part of the new Part 3 of the Bill. It is proposed to delete section 15 of the Bill to move it to the new Part 3 of the Bill. Amendment No. 5 replicates the exact text contained in section 15 and moves it to the new Part of the Bill which deals specifically with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Similarly, I propose to move section 16 of the Bill to the new Part 3 of the Bill. Amendment No. 6 is required to replicate the provisions of this section in the new Part of the Bill. I propose amendment No. 7 to provide for the amendment of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959 in the Long Title of the Bill. I propose Amendment No. 8 to provide for the amendment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 2003 in the Long Title of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion there was confusion about consultation with the Oireachtas Commission. As I recall, Deputy Howlin, a member of the commission, could not recall any consultation. The Minister of State was adamant it had taken place and there was a sense that this point was so important that it should be clarified. Will the Minister of State set out the exact position on consultation with the Oireachtas Commission on these proposals?</P>
      <P>While we all acknowledge that a Minister is the appropriate authority to dismiss certain senior public servants, the same relationship does not apply between the Taoiseach and the Clerk of the D&aacute;il. The Taoiseach is the head of the Executive and the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is a servant of the Oireachtas. If someone outside of the Oireachtas Commission must act as dismissing agent, it would be appropriate for it to be the Government rather than the Taoiseach. The phraseology used states the Taoiseach &ldquo;may decide to dismiss having had consultations&rdquo;. It leaves it open to the Taoiseach to dismiss a Clerk of the D&aacute;il, even if his consultations with the Oireachtas Commission or the Ceann Comhairle do not support that action. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s freedom to dismiss the Clerk of the D&aacute;il should be curtailed to a greater extent than is the case in the provisions set out.</P>
      <P>It is convenient to choose the Taoiseach because in the earlier legislation, he is the appointing authority. Perhaps the earlier legislation ought not to have the Taoiseach as the appointing authority, it should have been the Oireachtas Commission or the Government. Arguing that consistency with earlier legislation is sufficient justification to allow a Taoiseach the power to dismiss the Clerk of the D&aacute;il does not convince me. The Minister of State should elaborate why this selection has been made, if consultation has taken place or if the confusion, where a member of the commission did not know of any consultation, has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, had hoped to be here but with the change in timing <Col N="1532" />due to the debate on risk equalisation in health insurance, he has another meeting.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should clarify what discussions he has had with the Oireachtas Commission and if the commission has been fully consulted on the amendments being introduced. There was confusion on the last occasion and the Minister of State made a statement where he admitted he had not had consultations with the commission. It is important that we do not import into the Bill an arbitrary power for the Taoiseach when we have gone to the trouble of ensuring the affairs of the Houses of the Oireachtas are run by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. That must be clarified.</P>
      <P>The appointment structure must also be clarified. For anyone of the grade of principal officer or above, dismissal is basically a recommendation of the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Is that consistent with the provisions for other sections in the Civil Service?</P>
      <P>We were also told the Minister of State was importing on a sectoral basis references to whistleblowers, as was requested by the Labour Party, where, if a civil servant had come across material he felt should be divulged, it would not become a reason for summary dismissal. Do the same rules apply to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State introduced these amendments late in the day. I am glad he conceded to the Labour Party on the whistleblowers but I would like clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I clarified to the House that my side had given a misunderstanding on the degree of consultation. The amendments were proposed by the staff of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and were submitted to the Government following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. After considering the proposals, the Government agreed the proposed amendments were an appropriate way to deal with dismissal arrangements for these officers. Additionally, the representative of the Minister for Finance on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission offered members of the commission an opportunity to raise any issues they had regarding the proposed amendments. One Deputy took this opportunity to raise the issue.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments reflect the arrangements in the 1959 and 2003 Acts for dismissal of certain officers in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. If any new arrangements were put in place, it would represent a policy change in respect of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and it would not be appropriate to deal with such significant change in a piecemeal manner in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate that assigning the dismissing authority for key officers in the Houses of the Oireachtas is complex. In the unlikely event of it happening, it would be a sensitive issue to be dealt with. The importance of the role of the com<Col N="1533" />mission, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach is highlighted in the consultative arrangements set out in the 1959 and 2003 Acts that relate to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In light of the role of the Clerks and the Clerk Assistants to provide independent advice to Chairs and Members, it is not appropriate to provide that the appointing or dismissing authority lies exclusively in the hands of the chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The aim of the particular provisions relating to the dismissal of the officers of the Houses is to safeguard this underlying principle of independent advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the safeguarding of independence of advice to other committee chairpersons. However, I do not recognise how moving the power of dismissal from the Ceann Comhairle to the Taoiseach resolves this issue. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s role in the Houses is different from the relationship between Chairs and the Ceann Comhairle. All those officers have a certain duty to impartiality in their appointment and in the way they conduct their role in the Houses. By and large, they observe neutrality and fairness in their approach. However, there is no such obligation on the Taoiseach, who is the leader of the Government, to observe such impartiality. It would be expected of the Taoiseach that he or she would be partial to defend the positions adopted by his or her Government. In that sense, I do not see how this has been resolved.</P>
      <P>If the dilemma is that it would be an awful let-down to the committee chairpersons if the Ceann Comhairle was the key officer in deciding dismissals, I do not know how it can be resolved by moving the power to the Taoiseach. In the unlikely event of a dismissal, I have greater faith in the Office of the Ceann Comhairle than in the Taoiseach to consult other committee chairpersons and reach a sensible decision on an impartial and independent basis, taking to heart the interests of the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is no reflection on who the Taoiseach of the day might be. It should be someone on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission who would be the ultimate dismissing authority.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of the commission was to give the Oireachtas independence. The Minister of State claims he does not want to reopen the Oireachtas Commission legislation and question why the Taoiseach was made the appointing agent at that stage. I cannot recall why that decision was made at the time, but I find it hard to believe it was a decision to protect committee chairpersons from a marauding Ceann Comhairle. I do not see that as a likely state of affairs. Holders of the Office of Ceann Comhairle take their independent role seriously. They give up features of party membership and attendance at party meetings. They have the automatic right of re-election, reflecting their special position. We have gone a long way to buttress the independence of the office. I am not persuaded by the <Col N="1534" />Minister of State&rsquo;s concerns in how the Ceann Comhairle uses this duty and that the power must therefore be given to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>While it is unlikely this will become a major issue, this is the legacy we will give to future Oireachtas Members. It must be done right and based on a good knowledge of why this is the given legal opinion and how it will work in practice. The Minister of State has not convinced me. I would rather see the Ceann Comhairle as the dismissing authority. There would be a better chance this would be conducted equitably by a Ceann Comhairle than resting it with the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this puzzling. In the event of a crisis, if the Clerk of the D&aacute;il was dismissed, which has never happened, it would constitute a grave crisis in the administration of the D&aacute;il. If it was done by the Taoiseach, it would inevitably be seen as a heavily politicised decision by the Government of the day. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has been established with some degree of independence to mark the Houses as separate from the Government of the day. As we are setting up this administrative structure to give powers to secretaries general and Ministers in line Departments, it is odd not to use the Office of the Ceann Comhairle in this grave scenario that might lead to the dismissals referred to here.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is a constitutional officer with particular rights, responsibilities and duties to the Oireachtas. The Ceann Comhairle must act with high levels of impartiality as to how the business of the House is conducted. I cannot imagine a graver crisis than the dismissals envisaged in this section. The framework of impartiality for the Ceann Comhairle that is provided for in the Constitution and the legislation for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is not enhanced or expanded to provide for the provisions set out in this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is piloting this legislation, must elaborate on the advice he has been given. While the advice of the Attorney General may have been given to the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State must also have received it. If not, it leaves me feeling uncertain that he has not elaborated on why the Taoiseach of the day is the chosen instrument to effect the dismissals provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The rationale for assigning the responsibilities to the Taoiseach comes from the fact that the Taoiseach is also the appointing authority for each of these officers. This approach is consistent with the provision in section 7 where the Government can assign the dismissing authority to the Minister who has the power of appointing a successor to that civil servant. Identifying the appropriate mechanism for dismissal in respect of these officers has been carefully considered.</P>
      <Col N="1535" />
      <P>The approach taken is not exclusive to Ireland. Similar arrangements exist in other states where such appointments are made on the recommendation of a Prime Minister, or equivalent, such as in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The head of the office, as is the case with other parliamentary staff, is designated as a civil servant of the State and is independent of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s or Government&rsquo;s direction. The proposed amendment reflects the current arrangements set out in the 1959 and 2003 Acts relating to the dismissal of certain officers in the Houses of the Oireachtas. If new arrangements are put in place, it would represent a policy change in respect of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It would not be appropriate to deal with such a significant change in a piecemeal manner in this Bill. In this context, the Minister for Finance will consider the discussions which have taken place today as well as other discussions with Members and his representatives on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will also be involved and will also take these discussions into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has simply restated his previous comments, namely that this would break with the existing appointment system. He does not offer a rationale for it. The appointment of a successful applicant for the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il is a fairly routine matter and the Taoiseach simply rubber stamps it. However, dismissal is a different matter and this provided that the Taoiseach would make the appointment because of the convenience of the original legislation. That was a non-controversial position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the purpose of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is to establish the independence of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the Executive. It is quite acceptable that a Taoiseach might rubber stamp someone who has been selected successfully through a selection process. However, it raises significantly different issues when a Taoiseach can dismiss that person at his or her own discretion, albeit after consultation.</P>

    <Col N="1536" />
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than likely that a Taoiseach would be rubber stamping a recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite likely, but the legislation before us allows a Taoiseach to do so even if the Ceann Comhairle does not support that action. Hence it gives a Taoiseach the authority to dismiss the Clerk of the D&aacute;il in the same way that it gives a Minister the authority to dismiss a Secretary General. However, the relationship is different and the Minister of State has not addressed that issue. He has simply repeated the statements he made on a number of occasions, but simply repeating it does not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because a Secretary General is the boss of his or her Department, runs that Department and is responsible for its operations. However, the Taoiseach does not run the Houses of the Oireachtas. They are run by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the Taoiseach does not have the same presumption to dismiss that a chief executive might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately he does. He is the boss who takes the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving away from that position by stating that the Houses of the Oireachtas are self-governing and make their own decisions, which is why we are providing them with a budget and discretion. They will no longer be obliged to have their decisions sanctioned by the Minister for Finance or whoever, as was traditionally the case. However, the Minister of State appears to be carrying over this residual power of the Taoiseach to dismiss for no other reason than precedent. Apart from precedent, is it good practice or a good idea? The Minister of State has not convinced me of that.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that having passed through the Seanad and this House, we do not have a more adequate briefing as to why this is a good thing. Ultimately, we try to decide what is a good thing for the long term, not what has precedent or what is done in the UK. I am not persuaded by anything I have heard here but perhaps there is another reason which we have not heard. Appeals to precedent do not convince me.</P>

      <P>We are not getting an explanation. It is coming up to the holidays and all Members are anxious to have a break. Consequently, although the Minister of State and I have sparred on many occasions, I do not wish to reopen it now because for the most part it is lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s briefing note mentioned appointments made by the British Prime Minister. I am not a lawyer, but as I <Col N="1537" />understand it, the critical difference between our Houses of the Oireachtas and the situation in the United Kingdom where powers of appointment rest with the British Prime Minister, is that the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution. We have a Constitution and the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle are specifically provided for in it. Hopefully, the scenario which we are currently discussing will never happen because it would be a grave constitutional and political crisis. If that power is vested in the Taoiseach of the day, it would be impossible to use because it would become completely politically conflicted. Regarding the Minister of State&rsquo;s notes on the United Kingdom and the powers of its Prime Minister, is it not true that those powers arise because of the peculiarity of the constitution of the United Kingdom and the other countries to which he referred? I believe the Minister of State mentioned Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>And Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. They are all part of the Commonwealth and the old British empire. We however, are not and I have not heard the Minister refer to republican countries like ours. Has the Minister of State seen the written advice of the Attorney General? Has he had an opportunity to examine and discuss it? The reason he has given to the House does not stand up, from my limited conversations with lawyers and modest knowledge of history. He refers to the British constitution and the British Commonwealth countries which do not have a written constitution. We have a Constitution and while it is the end of term and Deputy Bruton and I are as anxious to leave as the Minister of State, it is a reasonable question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of consultation, Deputy Howlin represents the Labour Party on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. Fine Gael and all parties in both Houses are also represented. This was brought to their notice and the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s representative, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, asked people to come forward if they had any difficulties. One Deputy raised an issue &mdash; I understand it was Deputy Howlin &mdash; but he did not have a problem thereafter. Hence, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is responsible for this matter, is happy to have the Taoiseach in this role.</P>
      <P>It would be a grave crisis if such a situation arose and it is unlikely that the Taoiseach would act in a manner that was inconsistent with the views of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission or of the Ceann Comhairle. As Members are aware, any dismissal would leave the Taoiseach open to challenge, given all the judicial reviews and safeguards in place. Hence, such an action would involve sensitive consultation. Gen<Col N="1538" />erally, in the history of the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach has represented the largest party in the House &mdash; although a certain party previously put forward suggestions regarding the possibility of having a minority party appoint a Taoiseach. A Taoiseach will not expose himself or herself to challenge. Sensitive consultations and recommendations from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission would be involved in such a sensitive decision as the dismissal of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.</P>

It is entirely consistent with everything that has been done previously. We have consulted the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas, cross party and across Houses and they have no difficulty with it. It is a sensible way to proceed. As the Deputy has pointed out, in such a grave situation, given the sensitivities involved and all the safeguards that are in place for people who might be dismissed, the Taoiseach of the day would be very open to challenge. The very privileged position of the Ceann Comhairle in terms of the degree of consultation necessary in the matter is fully considered in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P el="0">Provision was made in section 28 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill to facilitate a person who is not satisfied with the outcome of an application that he or she had submitted to the education finance board, which disburses grants under a trust fund, to refer the case to the Office of the Ombudsman. In the course of the debate in the Seanad, Senator Ryan highlighted a drafting error in the legislation which could be interpreted as restricting those with a complaint against a decision of the education finance board from having it investigated by the Office of the Ombudsman. The Senator maintained that the wording could restrict the scope of the appeal. The Minister raised the matter with the Parliamentary Counsel and acknowledged that an amendment was required to address the error. Accordingly the Minister for Education and Science was happy to accept the amendment as drafted by the Senator on Committee Stage in the Upper House, whereby the word &ldquo;whom&rdquo; was inserted in page 18, line 7 of section 28. The inclusion of the amendment will ensure there will be no doubt as to who could have cases investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the amendment. I ask for clarification on an issue raised on Report Stage here. Will the education finance board been included in Part I of the First Schedule of the Ombudsman Act? Following our discussions we had understood that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, would introduce a proposal to ensure it would be included. Has this changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This error was identified by my colleague Senator Ryan in the Seanad. While it was described as a drafting error, as the Senator said it is quite a significant error. To regard it as a drafting error may be an oversimplification. If <Col N="1542" />the error had not been spotted the section would have read: &ldquo;Where, following an investigation under this Act into an action, it appears to the Ombudsman that the action adversely affected a person by or on whose behalf an application was made&rdquo;. This would mean that a person could be excluded from coverage under the Ombudsman Act.</P>
      <P>During our debate on this section, I was particularly concerned that we did not have absolute clarity that the education finance board would be covered under the Ombudsman Act. The Minister who was here for the debate said it would be more appropriate to do this under the Ombudsman Act rather than in this Bill. That the Bill was passed by this House and the drafting error was only spotted in the Seanad indicates that much confusion exists as to whether the board will be clearly covered under the Ombudsman Act. I would like an absolute assurance from the Minister of State that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the error was spotted. In fairness to those involved in drafting the legislation, nobody in this Chamber spotted the error. Unfortunately with legislation of this import which can have far-reaching consequences, it could be a matter of life and death. I welcome the fact that it is changing. I hope the Minister of State is about to say that the issue of the Ombudsman will be covered under legislation dealing with the Office of the Ombudsman. If not, can we have a good excuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am very conscious of the fact that it relates to a drafting error. Restrictions on victims should never be an option when dealing with child abuse and institutions. I still have major concerns about how victims were treated over the years. Many people are under the impression that child abuse took place 20 or 30 years ago. From a legislator&rsquo;s point of view, we must be vigilant when dealing with the victims of child abuse. In recent days, we have all heard the horrific story of how a young 11 year old girl was treated. It is very important those involved in child care, in the teaching profession and in forming legislation, are conscious that such abuse exists all the time. There are many dysfunctional families crying out for help every single day. We come across some of them in our clinics on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>All the people involved must be constantly vigilant. Young children should be able to seek help from the social services. I speak as someone who worked in the primary education sector for over 20 years and who dealt with child abuse cases. Some children found themselves in circumstances where the only friendly face was a teacher doing yard duty. It is important that victims are treated with respect and dignity. A number of Deputies raised this issue in other amendments. Victims of vaccine trials should have been allowed to bring their cases to court.</P>
      <Col N="1543" />
      <P>I hope we have learned about children in institutions. The system was flawed, major mistakes were made and major damage was done to children. We should stand back and pay tribute to the adoptive parents in Ireland. In the past 60 to 70 years, children who did not go to institutions were adopted by families and the vast majority of them were looked after very well. Adoptive parents rescued many children. Many of these children are now adults and are leaders in Irish society. Sometime adoptive parents feel angry because they are excluded from the debate on adoption, yet they were the heroes who rescued children from institutions.</P>
      <P>I commend Senator Ryan for noticing the drafting error. There should not be restrictions on anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Deputy McGrath was right when he spoke of the people affected. When we open the newspapers every day, we read reports of young people being abused. Some of those are now getting the opportunity to go to court, tell their stories and bring to account the people who abused them as children.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Gogarty&rsquo;s concerns about the issue of the Ombudsman. We were given assurances by the Minister for Education and Science when discussing the Bill that the difficulty surrounding the Office of the Ombudsman would be resolved by future legislation. I hope the Minister stands over those assurances. It would be terrible if, due to an error, the Office of the Ombudsman were not able to investigate causes of concern. I congratulate Senator Ryan for spotting the error.</P>
      <P>The legislation is positive and will, I hope, allay some of the concerns of the groups that made submissions throughout the process. There are still many people who are critical of how the process was set up. They are still angry, but the anger has much to do with the failure of the State up to now to take on board the hurt and anguish suffered by these people. They are also concerned that we get it right this time. I hope the situation is better now than it was at the beginning of this process.</P>

The Minister for Finance is agreeable to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the education finance board is subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies raised the issue of the clarity with which the Ombudsman was involved in appeals from the education finance board. Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan sought an absolute assurance on this and I am happy to provide her with it. I hope that also satisfies the other Deputies who contributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bringing forward today amendments Nos. 7 to 16, inclusive, from Seanad &Eacute;ireann which relate to the selection of a local resident as a member of the agency established by the Bill. During Report Stage a number of Deputies expressed reservations concerning the selection process for this particular member of the agency. I am sure Deputies will recognise that the development will benefit from having a resident of the neighbourhood on the agency. In formulating a process to select a resident it is important to ensure that the interests of the residents are properly represented and the process is democratic, transparent and as fair and inclusive as possible.</P>
      <P>The Fourth Schedule sets out an election process for selecting a residents&rsquo; nominee on the agency and residents&rsquo; representatives on the consultative group. I have introduced amendments Nos. 7 to 16, inclusive, to improve the operation of this process.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 of the Fourth Schedule provides a method of registering residents&rsquo; associations, community based groups, clubs and societies which will have an interest in the Grangegorman <Col N="1546" />development. These groups will provide the constituencies for the election of the nominees to the agency and the consultative group. It is designed to be as inclusive as possible of everyone living in the area in terms of both civic amenity and economic potential.</P>
      <P>The Minister has revised the election process for the selection of residents&rsquo; representatives. Amendment No. 8 changes the constituency to provide that the residents&rsquo; nominee to the agency will be nominated and selected by the residents&rsquo; associations and tenants&rsquo; associations in the Grangegorman neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>The two residents&rsquo; representatives for the consultative group will be nominated and selected by a broader range of groups which will include community groups and associations, parish and district associations and groups, youth and sports clubs and similar non-commercial groups as well as residents&rsquo; and tenants&rsquo; associations. This is the fairest and most impartial method to ensure that the interests of the residents of the neighbourhood are properly and adequately reflected.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 and amendments Nos. 9 to 14, inclusive, are required to distinguish between the two separate elections, that is, one to the agency and one to the consultative group. Amendment No. 15 clarifies subparagraph (4) of the Schedule and states that a person may stand for election for the position on the agency and the consultative group, assuming he or she meets the required eligibility criteria. If he or she is successful, however, the person must elect which position he or she will exercise. The Minister is confident that the election process will be a success.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 is a saving provision designed to provide flexibility in the event that a difficulty arises. If a representative cannot be selected, the process must be restarted. If on the second attempt a representative still cannot be selected, the process will be recommenced and the chairperson can decide that nominees do not need to receive the support of two registered groups.</P>
      <P>This major development is important, not only for the educational institution involved but for the significant positive impact it will make on the north side of Dublin. Placing all DIT at this north inner city location will make a significant contribution to the redevelopment of this part of the city. The positive benefits of the Bill include education and training, underpinning economic activity within the Grangegorman area, enhancing access opportunities, extending cultural facilities, the provision of recreational and sporting facilities, rebuilding and developing large areas of dereliction and creating direct and indirect employment opportunities. The Taoiseach has many pet projects.</P>

We would have liked more representation from residents&rsquo; groups and other groups working in the area, but I acknowledge that the Minister has come some way to meet the concerns of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify that these provisions entail residents&rsquo; associations and tenants&rsquo; associations in the Grangegorman neighbourhood for the agency election, but that a wider group may register as interested groups for the consultative group election where there will be two such representatives?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I raised some issues last night with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, who has agreed to examine them and I am awaiting a reply.</P>
      <P>Doctors are often criticised for refusing to make a complaint against a colleague. It is sometimes believed that this is the result of an old boys&rsquo; club approach. However, it has more to do with the fact that they have no protection in law if they raise issues of concern. The Dr. Neary affair was a case in point. That issue came to public notice because two student midwives, who had trained in Northern Ireland where is a different legislative framework, were horrified by what they saw taking place in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Drogheda and complained to their supervisor. The matter came to light when the supervisor took the complaint further.</P>
      <P>Why are consultants, who are very important and powerful people in hospitals in their own right, afraid to report their colleagues even to the Medical Council? The main reason is fear of litigation. If one cannot prove an accusation, one may find oneself in the High Court even if the allegation is true. Hearsay and circumstantial evidence are not sufficient. One must be in a position to demonstrate a problem exists. If one is proved wrong, the accused person can sue for defamation, even if the information is true but unproven. This creates a serious gap in ensuring <Col N="1550" />safety in hospitals and that issues that arise from time to time are addressed are reported.</P>
      <P>The Minister must address the absence of political and administrative support for consultants and other medical personnel who make a complaint and find themselves out on a limb as colleagues close ranks. Legislation on the medical profession, including this Bill, does not protect patients or doctors because it is ineffective when those at the top show weakness or lack of leadership. Fundamental changes are required to make this type of legislation work. The Bill is too reliant on people being genuine and well intentioned. We must bear in mind that if someone wishes to play the legal system or has ulterior motives or another agenda, the legislation will fail those it is meant to protect. For this reason the Government should consider the introduction of whistle-blowing legislation.</P>
      <P>It may transpire that a complaint made against a person is not completely true. Many such cases have become before the Medical Council which receives a large number of complaints about medical practitioners. Patients, for example, complain about the manner in which they have been treated by doctors. This is quite a regular occurrence. Many of these doctors are caring and considerate people and can be very upset and badly affected by complaints made against them. Such complaints are not always malicious as patients may genuinely believe they have been badly treated. Even if it is shown by the Medical Council that the doctor was not negligent or incompetent and is declared innocent after 12 months or so, the doctor still feels wronged if it takes 12 months to vindicate his or her good name.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in place at present to protect consultants who make a complaint, even if the complaint is not substantiated in the long term. This is the case throughout the public service, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the teaching profession and the medical profession, from psychotherapists to chiropodists and all the professions the Minister has included in the Bill, as well as those that will seek registration on the new body. We do not have a proper mechanism to enable people to make their views and concerns known without having to worry that if they put their concerns in writing or make a complaint, a lily-livered or weak-hearted administrator will release the information.</P>
      <P>Legislation is the way forward. I therefore welcome the Bill. There is far too much <i>ad hoc</i> regulation of the health care professions. I have been concerned for some time that somebody can call themselves a counsellor, put up a plate and operate as a counsellor without any training. There is very little regulation of such people, whether they are marriage counsellors, career guidance counsellors, bereavement counsellors or any other type of counsellor, and that can be quite dangerous, particularly where a person is in crisis. We have heard scary stories from time to time regarding the advice given by counsellors to <Col N="1551" />people and the lack of proper regulation of such people who sometimes charge well. People inside and outside the House are also aware of complaints regarding people involved in alternative medicine claiming they have cures for cancer and so on. Large amounts of money are charged by such people on questionable grounds. There is a need to ensure there is regulation of this area and that penalties apply where there is abuse.</P>
      <P>Some professionals believe they have been left out of the legislation as some titles are not specifically mentioned. One of the most important issues to arise since the introduction of the legislation relates to the title of physical therapist. Most of us have been contacted about this issue and we have received correspondence on it. It must be addressed on Committee Stage. If it is not resolved before the legislation is enacted, the title of physical therapist will remain outside the Bill&rsquo;s scope, thus creating more problems in the future. The Government should take the bull by the horns and deal with this issue now as it will arise in the future. I look forward to a more detailed discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A number of other organisations are omitted from the scope of the Bill. Given the complexity of medicine and the many qualifications now available, many other bodies will seek to be included in the legislation. In the same way as the Medical Council has given the medical profession status, patients want all health care providers to be covered by governing councils. The public will think those who are not included in the legislation are alternative or unqualified practitioners. That will have a detrimental effect on many people with qualifications who believe they should be included in the legislation. We must reduce ambiguity to serve the public interest and the Government must legislate for alternative practitioners at some stage. It is becoming so complex that people do not know where they stand.</P>
      <P>Psychologists are included in the Bill. However, some people call themselves psychologists and counsellors. We must clarify the qualifications required in that regard. People who qualify as psychologists have studied at a third level institution for a long time. They may be left out of the legislation, although we currently consider them psychotherapists. These people often have qualifications other than those attained at university. Others who do not have a qualification will also be left out. Perhaps the legislation could differentiate between patients and doctors because they do not know the qualifications of those described as counsellors and psychotherapists. It is a profession and it should be included along with the other 12 already mentioned in the legislation. Are there any means to consider that? If that group is established and meets the rules, can the Minister issue a regulation to include it in the legislation?</P>
      <P>Perhaps a regulatory body with 13 members will have to be set up. How would that fit in with the council proposed by the Minister? Would it <Col N="1552" />be difficult to nominate a member to the council? The majority of the 12 organisations mentioned participate in the public service. Perhaps the Minister believes that once they are covered, the public service remit will have been fulfilled. Does the Minister intend to look after the other bodies which do not have a public service role?</P>
      <P>We often ask about the definition of a medical scientist. It was stated that it is included in the Bill. Is it someone working in a pharmaceutical company, a laboratory or a hospital or is it a science graduate who is perhaps doing controversial research on embryos in a university? Perhaps this issue should be teased out on Committee Stage. We must bear in mind that there are also external factors to be considered. If someone is carrying out stem cell or embryo research, will he or she come under this legislation? Would he or she break the law if he or she did something which this House had not approved?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister named the representative bodies of the 12 professions mentioned in the legislation? Physiotherapists are represented by two organisations which will be nominated as being responsible for looking after their needs. Many of the bodies have at least two representative organisations and there could be conflict if one is chosen over the other. We must examine this issue on Committee Stage because the Bill is not clear in that regard.</P>
      <P>All the organisations mentioned by the Minister are involved in either the health or social welfare services. Why then are the ministerial nominees of these bodies named by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and not by the Minister for Health and Children? I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response in that regard.</P>
      <P>The sections of the Bill on registration, education, training, complaints, inquiries and disciplinary procedures are welcome. They follow the criteria used by the Medical Council on making complaints. The council, however, is moving towards all professional conduct committee hearings being heard in public. That has created anxiety for members of the medical profession because if a committee hearing is held in public, it will be reported in the media. If the committee finds that all charges are baseless, the media will not report that. There is no story if someone is innocent, only if someone is found guilty. The media is not obliged to report a story if someone is found innocent. However, in the interests of balance and fair play one would like to ensure that information about a person who has been publicly subjected to charges or suggestions about their profession but who has been found innocent is fully reported.</P>
      <P>Many professions will find themselves in a unique position when complaints are made about them. It is difficult for patients to get a hearing. Many of the professionals will be surprised when this legislation is enacted. At least the health committees will be held in private because they <Col N="1553" />will deal with emotional subjects for everyone involved.</P>
      <P>We would welcome a statement from the Minister on the number of professionals available in the psychiatric services. I am talking about psychotherapists and occupational therapists who are important in that area. The Irish College of Psychiatrists has informed us that 70% of its psychiatrists do not have a psychotherapist available to them. Some psychiatrists handle up to 600 patients at any one time. One psychiatrist told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that. We would welcome a debate on the need for multidisciplinary psychiatric teams to deal with hospital and community psychiatry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill in the area of health care regulation. I am happy the Fine Gael spokesperson has welcomed the Bill. We should all work to improve this area. I am sure issues will arise which will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, told us last week that the Bill will provide a system whereby individual members of the 12 listed professions will be certified as competent to practise. Unlike the present voluntary system, this will be a legally binding process with a mechanism for the prosecution of offences. That is an important aspect of the Bill. We were told its establishment would bring a system of statutory registration which we all agree is essential to ensure that members of the public are guided, protected and informed so that they can be confident that the health and social professionals providing services are properly qualified, competent and fit to practise. The system will ensure professional conduct and the maintenance of high standards of professional education and training among health and social care professionals. The statutory registration of the 12 health and social care professionals listed, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed, is long overdue. This work has been ongoing since at least 2000. It is critically important legislation for the reasons outlined by Deputy Neville and others.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the legislation will cover the private sector and the self-employed. Many of us involved in the public health care area have been concerned for many years about the lack of control over people who set themselves up as professionals, particularly in the private and self-employed sectors where few or no checks are carried out. There are concerns about several professions, especially those dealing with clients accessing mental health care such as psychologists and counsellors. Whether coping with alcohol or drug problems or other psychological difficulties, clients are especially vulnerable to coming under the care of people who do not have the professional expertise to deal with their problems and who are not, to put it mildly, best qualified to provide assistance.</P>
      <Col N="1554" />
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>My focus in considering the Bill is the need to protect the public from a medical care perspective. In that context, I notice the expression of concern by the Competition Authority about restrictive practices that might emerge on foot of the passing of the legislation. While medical care must be the overriding concern of the Oireachtas, I acknowledge warnings in the authority&rsquo;s report that professions may be able to manipulate the conditions of entry and the numbers being trained for their own benefit. The Committee on Health and Children has spent the past few years attempting to deal with orthodontics but the vested interests have beaten us until now. They have been able to manipulate matters to the extent that there are so few practitioners that the cost of treatment has become prohibitive. As I have said, however, our priority must remain the health care aspects of the legislation. Restrictive practices can be dealt with elsewhere and at a later date.</P>
      <P>On 28 October 2004, the Taoiseach announced the publication of the Bill and said the purpose of establishing a regulatory system was to ensure that members of the public would be guided, protected and informed to give them confidence that health and social care professionals providing services are properly qualified, competent and fit to practice. The worries of the Competition Authority about pricing can be addressed later, but it is the job of the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers of State, Deputies Se&aacute;n Power and Brian Lenihan, to ensure that purely health issues are dealt with in the legislation. I agree with Deputy Se&aacute;n Power and the T&aacute;naiste that the legislation is a key action in the health strategy on quality and fairness to expand and strengthen the regulatory environment in the health sector. It is long overdue. Like Deputy Neville, I am worried by the emergence of alternative medicine and practices and, in particular, by the proliferation of people who describe themselves as professional counsellors. It is imperative to introduce controlling mechanisms in these areas.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste described the system of statutory regulation proposed in the Bill as open and transparent and characterised by strong public interest representation that will serve to enhance the quality and accountability of health and social care services provided to the public. While most people will welcome her statement, the IMPACT trade union has expressed concerns as the representative body for quite a number of those who will be regulated under the legislation. IMPACT argues that the professions have waited for the legislation for a long time and makes a case, rightly or wrongly, that its members are being treated as second-class professionals within the health service.</P>
      <P>IMPACT says there is no good reason for introducing different approaches for different professions and cites the example of the Irish Medical Council and An Bord Altranais, which regulate doctors and nursing staff, respectively. The majority of members of the boards of those <Col N="1555" />bodies are members of the relevant professions. While I may have misread the report and the earlier documentation from the T&aacute;naiste, I got the impression that the report was the first of three and that arrangements for the medical profession and nursing will also change. I understand the T&aacute;naiste intends to bring forward further proposals to ensure that everyone is treated in practically the same way or according to the same criteria. I would appreciate a comment on that from the Minister of State in his reply. While I appreciate the need of trade unions to ensure their members are treated properly, IMPACT&rsquo;s concern is misplaced if it relates to the ratio on a board of members of the profession to people appointed from outside. While serving on a health board for many years, I found that a very fair balance had been struck. A 6:7 breakdown on registration boards is not too bad.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Ceann Comhairle, I am not qualified to decide what is required in a good counsellor or therapist. I respect fully, however, the other professions listed in the Bill and am concerned about the untold damage a quack could do practising in mental care. Some of the people who have gone into the area have a chip on their shoulder. Some who have earned degrees or status in other walks of life have simply put a plaque on the wall and immediately become professional counsellors. If a person does not have relevant training, even if he or she holds a related degree, he or she should not be in a position to function as a professional in the discipline in question. It is the duty of the State to ensure that cannot happen in the health care field.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville mentioned the significant changes that have taken place with the development alternative medicine and the split in specialisms. I thought a cardiac surgeon was someone who did heart operations, but then I found out there was a cardiac thoracic surgeon. As we have seen professions coin titles in the United States of America at the drop of hat, I fear that practitioners here will simply change title to operate free and easy. There is a need for provisions to control those who might attempt to avoid regulation as a member of one of the 12 professions designated in the Bill. The matter will have to be kept under observation.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that I do not take issue with alternative medicine and am not qualified to argue against it. I do not argue against the use by people of faith healing provided there are controls and that people are aware of what they are buying into. Issues of mental health, for example, are simply too sensitive to leave unregulated. A fractured leg is an obvious injury to treat, but matters are much more difficult where mental health is involved.</P>
      <P>The debate in this area has been ongoing since at least 2000. The consultative document, Statutory Registration for Health and Social Care Professionals: Proposals for the Way Forward, was published in October 2000. As the matter has <Col N="1556" />been in gestation for quite a long time, it is important to make progress. Deputy Neville referred to a further matter of contention, the representation of chartered physiotherapists by two separate bodies. While the Department will have to make a ruling on who is in and who is out, I sound a note of caution that people with bona fide qualifications should not be pushed aside simply because there is a group with a longer-standing title. The people who are qualified to adjudicate the matter are the officials and line Ministers in the Department.</P>
      <P>Each registration board will have 13 members, six to be members of the particular profession and seven from outside the profession to be appointed by the Minister. Each registration board will determine criteria for registration and so on. One of my concerns relates to numbers. With just the first tranche of professions we already have at least 156 people, plus 25 on the health and social care professionals council, plus the chief executive and his or her staff. I am not sure how many more professions it is intended to add to the list but it appears that the final number of people involved will be very unwieldy. I would hazard a guess that it is almost back to the health board figures already. I take the point that each registration board must have a separate group and that each profession must be individually monitored, but there is a significant number of people involved in that. I am concerned that the left hand will not know what the right hand is doing.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the chief executive officer would operate between the 12 bodies. We have been there and done that and it does not operate that way. Nobody can keep track of all these people. Will the Minister look at this proposed arrangement to see if it can be made less unwieldy? Speaking from my health board experience, I do not know how it could function efficiently. It was difficult to keep in touch with the three former standing committees on mental health, community care and general hospitals. It was mission impossible.</P>
      <P>This is an important document. One section deals with protection of titles. The Minister is empowered to protect additional titles by regulation. That area must be copperfastened. It would be an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a protected title or to falsely represent himself or herself as being a registered practitioner. Will practitioners of alternative medicine have to come up with alternative names for a particular practice? Will there be a mechanism for ensuring that the practice cannot be one of the listed ones?</P>
      <P>The issue of physiotherapists has been discussed. New names are regularly coined in the United States such as sanitary engineers for dustbin collectors and so on. This area must be tightened up. It was stated in committee that people will not be able to work their way around it. As we have seen with all forms of medicine, the public is willing to buy into anything if they have <Col N="1557" />the money. The public must be protected. I accept that the Bill, which is long overdue, is a key action in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You. It is intended to expand this list. Deputy Neville referred to a few possibilities. I am interested in finding out what is proposed.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the 25-member council about which I am concerned. Deputy Neville also referred to the fact that appointments would be made with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I was tempted to ask him about this when I had lunch with him today but I did not want to spoil his lunch. It is surprising that it is not the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The coherence and consistency of the system is critical. The intention is to promote uniformity of practice among registration boards. I am concerned that each of the 12 bodies would only look after its own bailiwick. There must be consistency. Deputy Neville expressed concern about the proceedings being held in public. Many disciplinary hearings that should be easily dealt with appear to require the involvement of junior and senior counsel. Very often they beat the system. Natural justice crops up and the courts find in favour of people. I am concerned that with 156 people vying for different things, we could be in trouble in this regard. I would like to hear how this matter would be handled.</P>
      <P>In the past, some of the right to practise groups such as nursing groups and the medical board were challenged legally. Deputy Neville outlined how the three statutory committees, the preliminary proceedings committee, a health committee and a professional conduct committee, would operate. It is complicated. I am concerned that, as we have seen in so many cases, the intervention of the legal profession would make it unworkable. Are these powers stronger and how do they differ from the powers of the nursing board or the medical disciplinary board?</P>
      <P>In that context, I welcome the fact that in extreme and urgent circumstances the council may apply to the High Court to suspend a practitioner pending completion of an inquiry. There has been a failure to do that in the past in certain circumstances where the outcome was tragic. It is important that people can take the initiative. It is not just business or an environmental issue that may be able to wait. We are talking about health and it is important that we would be able to move fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>The battle between the therapists will have to be adjudicated upon but it should be dealt with quite quickly. It is not just the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and its competitors that are involved. It relates to the area of regulation and of people being able to set up a separate category, separate title and to move on from there.</P>
      <P>I compliment those involved in the committee that was set up to examine social care professionals. They have done a great deal and <Col N="1558" />examined the issue of house parents and so on. They have looked at the child care area and having done an audit of the needs, they are willing to train people, which is crucially important. Many people will need training once the legislation is put in place. We should remember that and help to supply that training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. The Fine Gael Party welcomes the thinking and purpose behind it. It provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals as well as ongoing regulation. The Bill is not before time. It is quite extraordinary that the Government or previous Ministers under various Governments did not see fit to introduce such legislation before now. It is surely a vital responsibility of legislators to ensure that those professionals who provide health and social care to citizens are adequately and independently regulated by a suitable system.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Bill is the first of three which form part of the reform process of the health provision regulatory environment. The Minister made it clear in the Seanad that this Bill is the first of three steps to improve legislation in this area. Legislative measures to cover medical practitioners and nurses are to follow. I urge the Minister to introduce these as soon as possible. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will indicate when they are likely to be introduced.</P>
      <P>This Bill covers statutory registration for chiropodists, clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. A broad range of vital health services is covered by these professions. Members who have worked on health boards, as I have done, will be aware of the importance of the combination of skills such professionals possess.</P>
      <P>We must ensure the consumer is provided with a constant standard of care throughout the country. When a child needs specialist care, for example, its guardian or parent has no way of assessing accurately whether the available specialist, if there is one in the area, operates to an acceptable standard or has an acceptable skill level. Parents need to rely on the State and professional bodies to ensure a common standard of excellence is applied. That is the essence of this Bill and the reason it must be welcomed. The State is responding, albeit belatedly, to put a system in place to ensure that when parents take a young child to an occupational therapist or speech and language therapist, whether he or she is in Cork, Galway, Limerick or Mayo, they can be sure of a certain standard of skill or care.</P>
      <P>The national health strategy has many themes but the most important may be that of so-called patient-centred approaches to health care policy. This Bill represents a step forward in strengthen<Col N="1559" />ing the regulatory environment pertaining to health professionals.</P>
      <P>It is tempting to refer to some of the many areas where the Government&rsquo;s so-called patient-centred approach would be considered a joke if it were not so serious, but I will try to confine my remarks to the content and purpose of the Bill. First, let me consider the issue of the statutory registration of professionals. The proposed structure seems sensible enough. A registration board for each of the 12 professions listed will be set up and each board will have 13 members. Six of the 13 will be from the relevant participating profession and seven, appointed by the Minister, will be from outside the profession, thus ensuring independence and balance. While I agree entirely that there should be a majority from outside the relevant medical profession, I believe some difficulties might arise over how members of a board are chosen. In some cases, the professions concerned are represented by a number of bodies, as has been pointed out by various speakers. Perhaps the Minister of State will address this issue when he has the opportunity to do so. I will be interested to see the Minister&rsquo;s assessment criteria for deciding who should be on the boards.</P>
      <P>Consider the recognition of qualifications and assessment procedures. Having had the benefit of being involved in European politics for the past year, I believe it is essential to have automatic recognition of the qualifications of professionals from all 25 member states. A very interesting debate is taking place in the European Parliament at present on the services directive in term of whether health care should be part thereof and whether we should have absolute recognition of skills and qualifications of professionals from all 25 member states in all other countries. Will this Bill take into account the services directive if it includes health care provision?</P>
      <P>I seek clarity on the recognition of qualifications of professionals from non-EU countries. I recently dealt with a very good example of the problem to which I refer. A dentist from Russia, who is married to an Irish person and is an Irish citizen, received her qualifications from a recognised university in Russia, yet she is having great difficulty having her dentistry degree recognised in Ireland. If she had received her qualifications in Latvia, she would have no problem. We need to streamline a system for recognising qualifications of medical practitioners, especially those from countries that border the European Union. Although the example I cited concerns a dentist, whose profession is not covered by this legislation, the principle is the same.</P>
      <P>The principles of this legislation are welcome because we are ensuring a common standard, but when one reads the list of professions covered by the Bill, one realises that, in the majority of cases, there are not enough professionals in Ireland to provide adequate services. A parent looking for an occupational therapist or speech and language therapist for a child, or a physiotherapist for an <Col N="1560" />elderly person, will note a shortage of staff. If one talks to social workers, they will tell one they are over-worked. Although we need to ensure a common standard, we also need to ensure that when we bring in health and social care professionals from outside the European Union, as we will have to do, we will adopt a streamlined approach to recognising their qualifications.</P>
      <P>On registration, there is a need to add further professions to those covered by the Bill. Other speakers have referred to this. An osteopath visited my office recently and spoke about UK legislation, dating from 1993, which created a new registrar for qualified professionals, run by the General Osteopathic Council. Nine organisations representing osteopaths were amalgamated into a single registrar. We have no such registrar in Ireland. Regardless of whether legislation is required in its own right to address this issue or whether it can be addressed through this Bill, we must consider it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville referred to the difference between physical therapists and physiotherapists. More clarity is required in this area and I hope the issue will be explored on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State chooses to add another profession to the list of 12, the D&aacute;il and Seanad should be consulted. I am unclear how this can be done, or whether a Minister can do it of his or her own accord.</P>
      <P>After registration issues, one must consider the ongoing regulatory procedures dealt with in the Bill. Complaints of malpractice will be dealt by the health and social care professional council which is comprised of 25 people. Is it necessary to have so many? This number, however, was chosen in a bid to represent the 12 sectors concerned with the Bill together with 13 other individuals nominated by the Minister to ensure a majority of non-health care people.</P>
      <P>We should consider Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s point with regard to this matter. There is a need for whistleblower legislation in health care, as well as across a range of other sectors. Deputy Rabbitte raised the issue this morning and it has been promised time and again. Such legislation needs to be brought forward as a priority so that people who need to make a complaint can do so without fear of intimidation or potentially losing their job because of internal medical politics or downright bullying.</P>
      <P>Junior doctors may feel they should report something resulting from the work of a more senior consultant doctor in a hospital. Systems should be put in place to ensure that if somebody makes a complaint, whether they are a member of the public or, more importantly, another health care worker, they and their job are protected and they will not be discriminated against.</P>
      <P>This Bill moves regulation in health care in the right direction and, most importantly, protects the public. We should not expect parents or people who are ill to attempt to assess the doctor or professional they attend. That must be a given. Those people must be sure that the State has pro<Col N="1561" />vided the necessary structures to ensure they can go to a health professional in the knowledge that the person is of an acceptable standard for them, their child, parent or family member.</P>
      <P>The Bill protects the integrity of the health professional&rsquo;s title. People deserve recognition if they go to the trouble of educating themselves, sometimes over a period of ten years, to obtain a qualification. Others who take shortcuts and set themselves up as so-called health experts without the necessary qualifications must be exposed. This is not happening to a sufficient extent at present. The protection of professional titles is extremely important in health care because it also ensures that titles and professions are associated with excellence by rooting out people who are not suitable or capable of being health care professionals, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists etc.</P>
      <P>The Bill also protects the State. In years to come, people may well ask why we did not introduce the legislation earlier. There is a State responsibility if people have suffered as a result of malpractice and this legislation provides for necessary protection in the future.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would outline when we are likely to see similar legislation for nursing and medical doctors, so that we in Opposition can add our support when it comes forward. This is a move in the right direction. It is only a very small sector within the overall health portfolio. However, positive decisions such as this should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and always take every opportunity to praise his work in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are having such a civilised debate at the end of the D&aacute;il term and compliment Deputy Coveney on his speech. It is important that legislation which is good and regarded as helpful and useful is welcomed by all sides of the House. I am happy that this is the case in respect of the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the representations I received from my constituency and professional organisations, some of which have been referred to. People, particularly those in the professions, are very glad that this overdue legislation is now before us.</P>
      <P>When launching the Bill on 28 October 2004, the T&aacute;naiste said it would provide for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals. She went on to explain that the legislation is key to the health care approach, particularly in respect of the Quality and Fairness strategy and will expand and strengthen the regulatory environment in the health sector.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Dennehy, I am happy to sketch my own interest in this matter. I was a member of South Dublin County Council in 1994 and for<Col N="1562" />tunate to be appointed to the then Eastern Health Board where I remained until the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I was the founder chairman of the South Western Area Health Board. Apart from the everyday experience I have had in my life, the time I spent working in the health boards gave me tremendous experience which I can now bring to my work as a Deputy and legislator.</P>
      <P>The purpose of establishing this regulatory system is to ensure members of the public are guided, protected and informed so that they can be confident that health and social care professionals are properly qualified, competent and fit to practice. When the Bill was published, the Department described the system of statutory regulation proposed as open and transparent, characterised by strong public interest representation which will serve to enhance the quality and accountability of health and social care services provided to the public. We have moved on since the health boards but I am sensitive to the need to make the health services accountable. Some process should be found to allow public representatives make a contribution in that regard.</P>
      <P>I find the Health Service Executive is now dealing with our queries and correspondence in a professional way and that is as it should be. It is important we stress to the executive that those of us who are privileged enough to represent our communities often have many health queries and it is important that it would continue to provide a service for us so we can serve people in the community.</P>
      <P>The system of statutory registration will apply in the first instance to 12 health and social care professions, including chiropodists, clinical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social care professionals, social workers and speech and language therapists, irrespective of whether the professional works in the public or private sector or is self-employed. This is the first of three pieces of legislation to reform the regulatory environment for health professions, with legislation for medical practitioners and nurses to follow. It should be said that not everybody welcomed this legislation when it was published and many Deputies were in receipt of correspondence and representations from IMPACT, among other groups, making its case regarding the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I represent Dublin South-West which embraces Brittas, Bohernabreena, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and Tallaght and the issue of the lack of speech and language therapists crops up regularly through representations from parents, schools and Tallaght Hospital. While not wanting to divert from the issues relating to the Bill, I wish to make the Minister of State aware that there is still a great demand for speech and language therapists in various communities and my constituency is no different from anywhere else in that regard. Since I became a D&aacute;il Deputy three years ago, I have had a number of queries in that <Col N="1563" />regard from Tallaght Hospital and from a local school, St. Mark&rsquo;s primary school, in Springfield where I live.</P>
      <P>It is important that we maintain pressure to ensure that speech and language therapy is delivered, and that we continue to support people and stress to the Department of Health and Children that there is a difficulty in recruiting speech and language therapists. Apparently there is a difficulty in training a sufficient number of therapists and we should take the opportunity on every occasion to stress our support for what the Government is trying to achieve on this issue. I hope the Minister of State will send a note down the line on that point, not only for Tallaght, although principally for that area, but also for other communities.</P>
      <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals. We must acknowledge that the Government has always emphasised the importance of building consensus by using a highly consultative process with the professions involved. In this particular case, and if my mail is anything to go by, that is being achieved. The purpose of establishing this regulatory system is to ensure that members of the public are guided, protected and informed. In the past, the work of some of these professionals, through no fault of theirs, was not really known to the public. People did not always know what was involved and being done on their behalf by such professionals.</P>
      <P>We live in a society that demands information and it is important that we all take our responsibilities seriously in that regard. People need to know what is involved with a procedure and what is being done on their behalf. They also need to feel safe, as a number of contributors have already stated. This Bill has been broadly welcomed and it will do much good with regard to increasing people&rsquo;s sense of safety.</P>
      <P>Only a handful of health care professions are subject to statutory regulation at present, namely, doctors, nurses, dentists, opticians and pharmacists. I do not want to single out doctors as I have noticed that the last two occupants of the Chair during this debate have been doctors. That reminds me that those of our colleagues who are medical doctors will be telling Members of the House tomorrow to try to relax and take some time off during the summer. I know that members of the media do not want us to do that but I hope that the public does not think that we are going off for three months because we are not. I look forward to just taking a couple of weeks off and I will take any advice that any medical doctor gives me in that regard and rest for a couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies received telephone calls from one of the national newspapers yesterday inquiring about our holiday plans. I am not sure if they reached the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office.</P>

      <P>I told the journalist that I was too busy to make plans at present and would wait until the D&aacute;il was in recess before making any arrangements, but that I would be staying at home. I am always happy to stay at home. I have no problem with going abroad but as many of us as possible should stay at home and enjoy the countryside and I am happy to do that.</P>
      <P>The titles of the various professions referred to in the Bill will be protected and it will be an offence for a person who is unregistered to offer professional services to the public. I have already listed the organisations that are involved in that regard. Other colleagues have referred to the conflicting &mdash; I hope that word is not offensive &mdash; correspondence we have received from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and the Institute of Physical Therapy. Both organisations made their case strongly and their respective positions are now a matter of record among Members. To a great extent, it is incumbent on both organisations to make their case and to explain their views regarding the divisions between them. I will not necessarily put all of the documents on record, but it is important the Minister of State is aware in the context of this debate that Deputies are in receipt of a great deal of correspondence on this matter. Perhaps the Minister of State could note that point and provide us with some advice on the matter when he is summing up at the end of this debate.</P>
      <P>Many people will ask why particular legislation is being introduced but the case has been well made regarding this Bill. I have spoken to many people in my constituency who have said that they are happy that a regulatory system for these professionals has come to fruition, even if it is a little overdue. The important and positive point is that the legislation is now before us and the matter is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>Moves to introduce legislation to provide for the registration of certain health and social services professions have, according to the Department of Health and Children, been under consideration for a significant period. The Department has explained that, for various reasons, it has not been possible to proceed with legislation in the past. There are several pressing reasons such legislation should now be introduced. There are legitimate and genuine concerns among members of the public who need to be guided and protected so that they are confident that the professionals providing services are competent and qualified.</P>
      <P>The professional bodies have made the point in all their representations that they require protection where normal operational procedures and ethical factors make it impossible to exclude those who are unqualified or insufficiently qualified from engaging in professional activity. Among other reasons, this is because the professional bodies can only apply an ethical code to <Col N="1565" />their own members. The good name and reputation of the majority can be damaged by the actions of a small minority that bring the profession into disrepute, unless there is a mechanism for sanctioning professional misconduct and misdemeanour.</P>
      <P>A proper system of registration can allow for the investigation of allegations of incompetence or misconduct and enable disciplinary action to be taken. It can also provide a mechanism whereby practitioners who are compromised by ill-health or addiction can be dealt with appropriately and that is something which would be generally welcomed.</P>
      <P>Registration provides a legislative framework for the evaluation and approval of education and training courses, examinations, qualifications and institutions. This guarantees the proper development of education and training across the professions and some professions are already discharging these functions.</P>
      <P>Registration also provides a more widely informed and participative forum for the administration and implementation of the EU directives on the mutual recognition of third level qualifications in EU member states. It will also lead to greater consistency in the application of those directives. Voluntary codes of registration, while very useful in themselves, cannot by definition offer the legal protection afforded by a system of statutory registration. There must be a strong commitment to deliver the best possible service to patients and clients. This must be the primary concern of all when developing a system of registration for health and social care professionals in the State.</P>
      <P>The proposal is for a system of statutory self-registration for social care professionals and the other 12 health and social professions involved. The regime would provide a formal legal framework and administrative infrastructure within which the quality of the services provided to the public and the future development of the professions can be assured.</P>
      <P>The regulatory system will comprise a registration board for each profession to be registered, a health and social care professionals council with overall responsibility for the system and three statutory committees to deal with disciplinary matters. A chief executive officer and staff will administer the system. To ensure consistency across the registration boards, the chief executive officer will act as a registrar for each registration board.</P>
      <P>This House has dealt with many interesting and important issues over the past months and it would be unfair to single out one Bill. However, in this D&aacute;il term the Department of Health and Children has been to the forefront in a number of major debates on legislation. Like everyone else, the Department will be glad to pause and draw breath in the summer recess. I wish the T&aacute;naiste, the Ministers of State and the departmental officials well. It has been a somewhat difficult time during which they have dealt with <Col N="1566" />different issues. They provide a public service and they have the public&rsquo;s confidence in that regard.</P>
      <P>There will be other occasions when I will talk about the needs of Tallaght and Tallaght Hospital. I will certainly talk more about child care issues in my constituency. I am always happy to invite and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to my constituency. I hope he will take every opportunity to come.</P>
      <P>I will support this important legislation. The professions concerned regard it as a ground breaking Bill. As Senator Ormonde has often stated, one must look after the public and continue to give the public what it wants. This Bill will regulate various professions and services provided to the public on a daily basis and as such will be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Ceann Comhairle and the staff of the House well and hope they have a good summer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. Our health and social care and the different professions covered by this Bill provide a vital service to the country. It is important that those under their care can be assured they are fully qualified and trained professionals.</P>
      <Col N="1567" />
      <P>The registration system must ensure that the best possible service is delivered to patients, clients and service users. However, it is vital that the new structures do not have adverse effects on competition in the various professions. I welcome the proposed system of self-regulation that includes members of the professions involved and members of other sectors, including the general public. Registration of health professionals is necessary to ease the legitimate concerns of the general public that they are visiting a health professional who is properly trained and competent to look after them. Registration gives both professionals and the public protection from quacks and non-qualified persons working in specific health areas. Registration can also protect the good name of a profession.</P>
      <P>A proper registration system gives the public and the professions protection because it allows investigation into all allegations of misconduct or incompetence. The registration framework of statutory regulation allows for the appraisal and approval of education and training courses, examination, qualifications and institutions, thus ensuring a proper development of education and training across the professions. It also allows consistency in the application of EU directives concerned with mutual recognition of third level qualifications in EU member states.</P>
      <P>While section 4 allows for the addition of other health and social care professions in the future, this Bill deals with 12 professions. However, the health service has approximately 35 grades that come within the overall terms of health and social care. Will this section also allow the registration of specialties or will this issue be left to the registration boards? Health and safety officers were included in the initial consultation process and I ask the reason they are not included in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Physiotherapists as a group seem to be more concerned than most regarding this Bill. I have received representations from physiotherapists in the past week and also representations from the physical therapists. They are anxious regarding the protection of title of their professions. Many members of the public consider the two professions to be the same but this is not the case. Efforts to have the two separate titles included in section 4 were not accepted. I ask that the Minister consider this matter again to avoid confusion. I received a letter today from a constituent who has a degree but is now in his third year as a student of physical therapy. He believes his study and work should be recognised in its own right. In his opinion, the role of physical therapist should be recognised and the position should be clarified. I am currently receiving treatment from a physiotherapist. I am biased in that direction as she, hopefully, is doing an extremely good job.</P>
      <P>In dealing with health and safety aspects related to the legislation, I cannot but refer to the recent controversy about nursing homes. This was <Col N="1568" />obviously a case where lack of supervision brought an important sector into dispute. It was shown by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and other reports that individuals in different professions have failed completely to honour their role in regard to patients and thereby damaged the credibility of the whole system. It is vital that new criteria are put in place to make sure that this neglect does not happen again not only for the sake of the elderly and the disabled in the long term but also for the credibility of the health service.</P>
      <P>There seems to be no measure in the Bill to protect consultants or others who may make a complaint. One cannot but reflect on the extremely serious incidents that happened in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda in my health board area, as it used to be known. For years practices were not reported as people were afraid to report them because of what might happen to them. There is ongoing litigation and a demand for an inquiry into those incidents. This Bill, prior to being passed, must provide that where a consultant or a practitioner at that level believes it is necessary to make a complaint, he or she can do so in confidence to ensure that at least such a complaint is investigated so that the highest standards of health care obtain. I urge the Minister of State to examine that aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Having met the victims of the controversy in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, on numerous occasions, I have nothing but admiration for the courage it took for those people to raise these incidents. However, one must be concerned about a system that allowed such practices to continue for so long as a result of which many people suffered.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a number of remarks made by the T&aacute;naiste on the Bill in the Seanad &mdash; I do not believe she spoke on it in the D&aacute;il. She said this is the first of three Bills to reform the regulatory environment for health professionals, with legislation for medical practitioners and nurses to follow. It was pointed out that we have been waiting for this legislation for almost 20 years. It is important that these are not only fine words but that there is a follow-through on this commitment and that the other Bills will be enacted. The T&aacute;naiste said that the vision adopted in the strategy for our future health system set great store on treatment, treating people with dignity and respect. She said that the health strategy envisaged that action would be taken to strengthen the customer focus of service providers. Those are fine words and if one were not dealing with some of the cases with which I and my constituency colleagues are dealing in Cavan-Monaghan, where there is a shortage of professionals and a lack of services, one would not be so concerned. When dealing with a case such as one I dealt with the other day where a person could not be treated in Cavan hospital due to the shortage of personnel because of an internal problem rather than a shortage of professionals, <Col N="1569" />one realises the serious nature of the problem. The T&aacute;naiste said that there must be a patient-centred approach to the delivery of services, with which I am sure we all agree. This Bill is important to ensure that good quality professionals are in place, but there must also be good management.</P>
      <P>I welcome the objectives of the new council which are to protect the public by promoting high standard professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions. There is a problem concerning the shortage of such professionsto which Deputy Coveney referred. I can think of several professions where there is a shortage of personnel to deal with the people&rsquo;s needs. For example, there is a shortage of psychiatrists to evaluate children who require an assessment and even when such children are evaluated there is a difficulty in securing necessary resources in terms of finance and personnel.</P>
      <P>I sought in recent days to raise a matter on the Adjournment concerning Rockcorry national school. As that school approaches the next academic year, some of its personnel were evaluated, which it understood had been approved by the Department of Education and Science, but suddenly these personnel did not meet the criteria laid down although they are on the relevant education list. Now the school does not know whether it will have special needs teachers, the services of whom some children attending that school badly need next September. Regulations are all very well, but there must be a follow through on the part of management.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that each of the designated professions will be represented on the council and that there will be a representative of the public, the voluntary sector and the third level sector. The fact that the council will comprise 12 members from the professions and 12 members from other sectors will create a healthy balance among its membership, but will this balance be affected when additional professions come into the registration system? This Bill provides for the registration of 12 professions &mdash; there cannot be many more that may come into the registration system. How long will members of the council hold office? Can members be reappointed to office or will there be a fixed term of office?</P>
      <P>Section 28 deals with membership of the registration boards. IMPACT did not agree with the composition of those boards. It was concerned that the professions are outnumbered on the boards and that their representatives should be in the majority in terms of education and training issues. However, there would be a concern about the representatives of the professions constituting a majority in regard to complaints, inquiries and discipline issues.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 32, following concerns raised by my colleagues in the Seanad, we welcome the amendment to the Bill in the Seanad which requires the registration boards to submit to the Competition Authority draft by-laws that <Col N="1570" />relate to the adoption and revision of a code on professional conduct and ethics. Although the council does not have to accept the options put forward by the Competition Authority, the authority is happy that its opinion must be taken into account by the council, which is made up of numerous professions when deciding on such by-laws.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 38 which provides that each registration board must register each person who holds an approved qualification and satisfies the board that he or she is fit and proper to engage in practice of the designated profession. Are proper regulations in place to provide for those professionals who come here to work from other countries given that we depend greatly on such personnel? While such personnel do their very best and are essential to our health service, families encounter great problems communicating with them, which leads to difficulties. Can more be done in this area in terms of the provision of education or interpretation services?</P>
      <P>The Bill will play a major role in regulating health professionals. I wish to refer to the running of the health service generally. I cannot but refer to one element of it of which I am extremely conscious because of the area I represent, especially my immediate parish. I refer to psychiatric treatment and the direction we are going in that area. I am concerned because of the number of suicides that have taken place. I mentioned one case in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago, that of a close friend of mine, Fred Williamson, who sought professional help but failed to get it and in desperation took his life. We need to look at how this whole issue is monitored and dealt with. We all agree people, whether aged, psychiatric or whatever, should be dealt with as far as possible in their own homes or as close to home as possible. Each individual case has to be taken into account. We must have some professional responsibility. As we consider the Bill before us we must examine that whole aspect as well. There are buildings and beds as well as staff &mdash; whom I have talked to &mdash; who are prepared to look after some of these people in care, whether for a short or long term. We must respect the right to life and realise there are individual situations which are different from others. There are individual family situations that are different to others. Some families have great back-up services and availability of help. Others do not. A patient just cannot be looked at in isolation. He or she must be looked at in the context of the entire situation as it stands.</P>
      <P>It is only when one is faced with issues such as this involving very close friends directly that one realises the problems that exist within the health service. Problems arise when basic rules are set down as regards doing something this way or that. I would like the professional groups to really examine this situation. I am a lay person. I am a farmer by background and a politician by profession. However, I have some understanding of human relations. I have seen marvellous work <Col N="1571" />done by the psychiatric services, both in-house and in home service. However, we are in a serious situation when senior people set down rules and laws that cannot be broken. While it is not totally relevant to the Bill before the House, I cannot help on this my last opportunity to speak in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, possibly, before the summer recess, to bring this issue forward and put it on the record of the House. It is one I feel very strongly about, as I do about alcoholism and the lack of services in that area as well. When one sees young people being buried because they cannot get help for alcoholism, and the buildings and the opportunities to help exist, one has to worry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact this Bill is before the House. I welcome the fact the 12 groups which have been looking to have their positions regulated for so long are seeing this achieved, finally. Psychologists are included in the legislation, but some people call themselves both psychologists and counsellors. My colleague, Deputy Twomey, mentioned this in addressing the Bill earlier. I agree with him that we must make the qualifications crystal clear. There are big differences and a proper structure needs to be put in place.</P>
      <P>Whenever psychologists decide that young people need a service, as with Rockcorry school, it should be ensured that staff are provided for this purpose. There are only 31 pupils in Rockcorry school, and six children there need a proper service. There is no point in an evaluation being done if the service is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation. The debate on the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill is both relevant and important because it is about change and improving quality, professionalism and accountability. It must be broader than that, however. This debate has to be about the creation of provision for people who work in the services in a caring and considered manner. It is interesting that we have different views on this legislation, but in view of its importance all views should be carefully listened to so we can make a final decision on it.</P>
      <P>The debate is about professionalism, caring and accountability. These are three key words in the Bill because health is a major political issue, particularly as regards assisting those who are ill, people with disabilities and supporting those who need major back-up services. Before I was elected in 2002 I was a member of the Independent Health Alliance. A group of us got together and campaigned on the health and disability issue, to bring it into the political arena and into the D&aacute;il. I had the great honour and privilege to be elected by the people of Dublin North Central, on a strong health and disability platform in particular. We have arrived today and this is part of the discussion as well, because it is very important.</P>
      <P>The Bill is also very relevant for people with disabilities. We have seen over the past 24 hours <Col N="1572" />the passing of the Disability Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which for many people was flawed legislation. It is very important that in this debate we get the opportunity to highlight the weakness in the legislation and also to talk about its positive aspects. On the issue of health care and professionalism, even in the last few days a young child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome in the west was denied resource teaching hours because of a decision made by a number of professionals working in the field. This is totally unacceptable and disgraceful. The Disability Bill has not been passed 24 hours as yet.</P>
      <P>As regards the details of the legislation, the Bill is entitled:</P>
      <P LI="1">An Act to provide for the establishment and functions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and of registration boards for certain designated health and social care professions; to provide for the registration of persons qualifying to use the title of a designated profession and for the determination of complaints relating to their fitness to practise; and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That, basically, is what the Bill and the debate is about. In Part 1 of the Bill, dealing with preliminary matters, one sees &ldquo;council&rdquo; means the Health and Social Care Professional Council, established under section 6. The word &ldquo;court&rdquo; in this section means the High Court, while &ldquo;designated profession&rdquo; means a health and social care profession, as designated in the Bill. These are important terms to grapple with before we get into the details of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 4(1) says: &ldquo;For the purposes of the legislation the following health and social care professions are designated:&rdquo; I will concentrate on the psychologist, the social care worker, the social worker and the speech and language therapist. Nowadays, it is accepted by the mainstream political establishment in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and broader society that there must be quality professionals, working in the services, and some of these people are the psychologists. They will play a major role over the next three to five years in dealing with services for people in the broader sector, but also children and people with disabilities, especially children.</P>
      <P>As Members talk about the designated professions in this section, I remind the House of the words &ldquo;care&rdquo; and &ldquo;professions&rdquo;. I would like to see quality people working in the field of psychological services. Many such people have gone into this area in the last 12 months as regards the provision of services for children with disabilities. However, I would like to see them more involved directly in ensuring a child with disability is treated in a caring and professional manner. As regards radiographers, these people, as well, have a major role to play. They are already saving lives in the mainstream health service. I commend the people directly involved in the radiography services in this State. However, we need more professions to be more involved directly in the <Col N="1573" />services. This is a political issue. Why are there too few radiographers? Given the hundreds of millions of euro we spend each year on the health service, why is there no proper radiography service?</P>
      <P>Section 4 covers the designation of health and social care professions. It is vital to have the right people making the right judgments. While I accept the necessity to require certain baseline academic qualifications, I am also concerned that many professions have developed in a flawed manner over the past five or six years. We are obsessed with points and the race to achieve professional status and qualifications. Why are many boys and girls in second level education who would love to become social workers, health care workers or psychologists prevented from entering these professions because they cannot achieve the high points required to enter the third level system? We are losing many quality people as a result. The other side of the current system is that some trained college graduates discover after two years in the job that they do not like working with children or people with disabilities and then decide to jump ship. This matter needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>During my regular discussions with transition year and fifth year students in schools in my constituency I meet wonderful young boys and girls who would make fantastic physiotherapists or speech and language therapists. However, they are precluded from entering these professions when they do not obtain a set number of points in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>To be called to begin teacher training in the primary sector 25 years ago, a student first had to get a certain number of honours in what was the equivalent of today&rsquo;s points system. A second important step involved attending St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Drumcondra for a tough interview. Sitting around the table was a group of psychologists and child experts who decided, following the interview, whether candidates were suitable to work with children. Interviewees had to perform simple, basic tasks such as singing a song. The selection process, therefore, combined a requirement to achieve good baseline academic results and undergo a tough interview in which candidates were examined and cross-examined to determine whether they could be trusted and were suitable to work with young children. This approach is relevant today, notably in the context of training health care workers.</P>
      <P>The role of social workers arises in the context of section 4. Deputies will all have had good and bad experiences of social workers. On the one hand, it is vital to defend the professionalism and integrity of social workers while, on the other, social workers have a duty and responsibility to ensure that children who find themselves in crisis or are sexually abused in dysfunctional families are rescued. They must be prepared to use the law to take tough decisions. Disgraceful incidents of sexual abuse have been perpetrated against children. In recent days, for example, we have <Col N="1574" />heard of the horrendous experiences of a girl at the age of 11 in the Dalkey case. Social workers must be focused and professional. The House will, through legislation, address the issue from a legal and constitutional perspective. We must ensure the right people are doing the job of social worker, whether they are providing services from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or late at night.</P>
      <P>Section 4(3) defines a health or social care profession as:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . . any profession in which a person exercises skill or judgment relating to any of the following health or social care activities:</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the preservation or improvement of the health or well-being of others;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the diagnosis, treatment or care of those who are injured, sick, disabled or infirm;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the resolution, through guidance, counselling or otherwise, of personal, social or psychological problems;</P>

      <P FLI="0">Paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) highlight the overall theme of the Bill and emphasise the importance of ensuring that people with disabilities and the elderly are part of a broader debate. Sadly, we do not do enough for elderly people. It is unacceptable, for example, that some of them do not have access to top quality health care. I remind Deputies that the elderly helped build the economy that has delivered the sustainable growth we enjoy today. It is payback time.</P>
      <P>The broader issue is that rather than placing elderly people in institutions or care settings without their consent, they should, where possible, be treated in their own communities with the assistance of support services. The Government has failed to provide sufficient community supports for the elderly, an issue on which I have tackled previous Ministers.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) refers to &ldquo;the resolution, through guidance, counselling or otherwise, of personal, social or psychological problems&rdquo;. Let us ensure that counsellors who try to advise and assist people in difficult circumstances are given maximum financial support. Resources allocated for this purpose should never be clawed back. The beneficiaries of the services provided by health and social care professionals are human beings and must be shown respect and treated with dignity.</P>
      <P>Modern society is turning its back on the importance of providing care for people with social or psychological problems. The downside of economic success is that people are too busy to spend time listening to others or caring for them. Many elderly people live alone on estates in Dublin, Kerry, Galway or Cork and do not know the people who live two doors away. This was not the case 20 or 30 years ago when we had few resources. We need to implant in the minds of <Col N="1575" />our children, at a young age, that there is nothing old-fashioned about caring for one&rsquo;s neighbour. Human and community services also include a responsibility on every one of us.</P>
      <P>Section 7 defines the object of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council as: &ldquo;to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.&rdquo; Section 8 defines the council&rsquo;s functions, which include to:</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) oversee and co-ordinate the activities of registration boards,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) provide administrative support and secretarial assistance to registration boards and their committees,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) receive applications and make decisions under Part 4 concerning the refusal of registration boards to grant or restore registration,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) enforce standards of practice for registrants of the designated professions, including the codes of professional conduct and ethics adopted by their registration boards,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>e</i>) establish committees of inquiry into complaints under Part 6 against registrants of the designated professions,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>f</i>) make decisions and give directions under Part 6 relating to the imposition of disciplinary sanctions on registrants of the designated professions,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>g</i>) advise the Minister, either on its own initiative or at the Minister&rsquo;s request, on all matters relating to the Council&rsquo;s functions under this Act. . .</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">While I strongly support sections 7 and 8, I share the concerns expressed by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, ISCP, that the protection of patients is not given paramount importance in the Bill, which it deserves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The most recent statistics on poverty levels in Ireland are derived from the new 2003 EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC, and were released earlier this year by <Col N="1576" />the Central Statistics Office. This survey replaces the Living in Ireland Survey, which was conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute until 2001 and which provided data on consistent and relative poverty up to that year.</P>
        <P>The nature of poverty and its effects are multidimensional and no one measure can give a complete picture regarding deprivation, poverty and social inclusion.</P>
        <P>The relative &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; indicator measures income alone. The EU-SILC results reported that 22.7% of persons were at risk of poverty in 2003 based on the proportion of the population below an income threshold of 60% of median income. The 2003 figures represent a slight increase on the 2001 figure of 21.9%.</P>
        <P>When countries experience rapid economic growth, however, as in Ireland in the 1990s, relative poverty measures on their own may not provide a clear measure of actual poverty. For example, using the &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; measure, relative income poverty in Ireland rose from 15.6% to 20.9% between 1994 and 2000. If we use the same measure and timeframe and increase the poverty line only by consumer prices, the &ldquo;anchored poverty line approach&rdquo;, the level of poverty falls by 55.9%.</P>
        <P>The main reason, therefore, for the increase in the &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; rate is the increase in incomes generally on which this rate is in part measured. For example, a recent EUROSTAT study calculated the monetary value of the 60% threshold in terms of purchasing power standards terms in 2003 for a household of two adults and two children. The value of the threshold for Ireland is above the EU average and is ranked eighth highest overall in the EU 25. Many households in Ireland with incomes below the 60% threshold may have a better standard of living than similar households classified as not at risk of poverty in other member states.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, not all those below the 60% of median income threshold are regarded as being in poverty, even in an Irish context, as that also depends on other factors such as the extent to which their income is below the threshold, the length of time they have been living on a low income, the degree to which their assets will have run down while on a low income and the other resources they have at their disposal. This indicator measures income alone and does not take account, for example, of the high level of home ownership and entitlement to household allowances such as electricity, fuel, television licence and telephone rental, which are particularly important in Ireland in the case of the elderly.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; measure is used in this country to identify those experiencing basic deprivation. This is calculated by identifying from among those at risk of poverty with incomes below the 60% threshold those who are also deprived of basic goods and services regarded as essential for living in Ireland today. The EU-<Col N="1577" />SILC survey reported that 10.2% of households experienced consistent poverty in 2003, up from 5.2% in 2001 under the earlier LIIS survey. However, both the CSO and the ESRI have made it clear that methodological differences between the two surveys mean the figures for 2001 and 2003 are not comparable and that it is therefore not possible to conclude from them whether the level of consistent poverty changed.</P>
        <P>There is certainly no reason to believe there has been a worsening in poverty levels in recent years. Between 2001 and 2005 spending on social welfare payments has increased from &euro;7.8 billion to &euro;12.2 billion. During the same period the lowest social welfare rates have increased by 40% while the consumer price index has increased by just over 13%. As a result of budget 2005, welfare payments have increased by three times the expected rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, what is not in question from the survey results are the groups identified as being most at risk. These include families with children, mainly lone parents, or larger families, those who are unemployed or with disabilities, and older people, especially those living alone. EU-SILC confirms the findings of earlier analyses in this regard and provides information on the most vulnerable groups in society towards whom policy should be focussed.</P>
        <P>While the EU-SILC results highlighted the difficulties in measuring poverty, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, prior to the release of these results, had approved a review of the method of poverty measurement in Ireland. This work is now being progressed as part of the NAPS data strategy, co-ordinated by the office for social inclusion based in my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>Does the Minister agree he is massaging the figures and that he has ignored the number of children in relative income poverty who live in households where the income is less than 60% of median disposable income? Does he agree the number of these children is estimated to be an additional 240,000 on top of the between 60,000 and 120,000 children whom the Minister says are affected in some way by consistent poverty? Does he agree it is a disgrace in this day and age? What has he done and what does he intend to do about it in the short term to ensure these children are removed from the risk of poverty?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that lone-parent households are exposed to a greater incidence of child poverty than dual or single income two parent households? Will the Minister tell the House why this figure of relative income poverty represents the highest rate of child poverty to be found in the European Union? This is an indictment of the policies of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Government, they have failed the children of Ireland by ignoring relative income poverty statistics put forward by the Combat Poverty Agency, an independent agency that castigated the Government for not taking relative income <Col N="1578" />poverty into account and ignoring its impact on children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The relative income poverty measure here is 22.7%. At the risk attracting unwanted headlines, I do not believe 22.7% of the people of Ireland live in poverty. That is the relative income measure and the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; is important. We are all poor relative to someone else. I have been critical of the measurements before. I rely on the figures from the ESRI, NESC, CSO and EU but I also point out to those bodies that the Department is working through the NAP strategy to make progress in this area.</P>
        <P>We must get our act together on how we measure poverty. We cannot use the figure of 22.7% because it is not real. The Deputy made the point about children living in relative poverty. There is another, more realistic measure &mdash; consistent poverty &mdash; and I am targeting resources at it. Welfare spending in 2001 was &euro;8 billion and this year was &euro;12 billion, with a huge proportion of that going into child benefit and much of it being targeted at families.</P>
        <P>Whatever differences there are about percentages, there is no difference about where poverty exists. All studies point out that those most at risk are families with children, mainly lone parents, larger families, those who are unemployed or disabled and older people living alone. I am targeting those areas with the carer&rsquo;s allowance, increased lone parent&rsquo;s allowance, child benefit and a range of supports and I am making it easier for people to get back to work, the best way to tackle poverty for those able to do it.</P>
        <P>I caution against operating from the totally unrealistic figure of 22.7% because relative poverty is an interesting academic measurement but, paradoxically, as the country gets richer, the relative poverty figure increases. If the country continues to grow at this rate, will be talking about 60% of the people being poor in ten years? The figure must be looked at in that context. It is useful but in terms of focusing on the vulnerable groups, it is not helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister says he will ignore relative income poverty and he will not answer the question about what he will do to address poverty. Does he agree that 148,000 children are in consistently poor homes &mdash; 14.6% of all children &mdash; according to the latest CSO data from 2003, as reported in the most recently published ending child poverty policy document produced by the Combat Poverty Agency?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister tell us what &ldquo;consistently poor&rdquo; means and what he intends to do about this? I do not want to know what he has done, I want to know what he will do about it. These are up to date figures from the Combat Poverty Agency. Will he continue to ignore relative income poverty? Is it Government policy to ignore statistics from the Combat Poverty Agency on children in relative income poverty?</P>

        <Quest> if he will take steps to increase the income limit his Department has put in place for the receipt of various benefits from &euro;317.43 to &euro;420 in view of the fact this limit has not been adjusted for several years; if his attention has been drawn to the impact this limit has on lone parents and others in availing of secondary benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[23516/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am conscious of the need to facilitate persons in receipt of social welfare payments to take up employment opportunities and to ensure the social welfare supports are structured to support this objective. I am aware of the specific issue raised by the Deputy, which was also raised in the recent discussions at the committee on social affairs that he chairs.</P>
        <P>Several measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include easing of means tests through income disregards, tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.</P>
        <P>The income limit referred to applies to people who take up employment under approved employment schemes, and who, because of their employment, do not qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules of the supplementary <Col N="1580" />welfare allowance scheme or for other secondary benefits. People in those circumstances may be entitled to retain these secondary benefits, in total or in part, for the duration of the scheme, subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. While the income limit of &euro;317.43 per week has not changed for several years, other significant improvements have been made to the means test since then. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are now disregarded in the assessment of the &euro;317.43 limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded.</P>
        <P>People who had been unemployed and who commence employment through the back to work scheme can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the &euro;317.43 weekly limit in question and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement. For example, in the first year of their participation in the back to work scheme, a single person can have combined income from the back to work allowance and earnings of &euro;429 per week while a couple with two children can have a weekly income of &euro;528.25.</P>
        <P>Other improvements have also been made to the retention arrangements. The period for which rent or mortgage interest supplement may be retained has been extended to four years on a tapered basis; 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. As a consequence of these improvements many families retain more of their rent or mortgage interest supplement than had been the case.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Participants in the back to work and community employment schemes are assessed under either standard rules or under retention rules and will be entitled to receive payment under the more favourable option. Alternatively, people who do not qualify under these retention arrangements can apply for rent supplement under the standard rules of that scheme. Under these rules, rent or mortgage interest supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?>
        <P>Family income supplement is now also disregarded in the standard means test. In addition where the employment is part-time, that is, fewer than 30 hours per week, up to &euro;60 is disregarded in the means test thus ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>I am aware that the income level of single parents who take up community employment places exceeds the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit. <Col N="1581" />However, this does not exclude them from receipt of rent or mortgage interest supplement as they have the option of being assessed under standard supplementary welfare rules. One impact of the changes means that more people qualify for support under the standard rules of the schemes in question and are not subject to the thresholds that apply to the special rules governing retention of secondary benefits. They are also financially better off than they were before taking up the community employment or other opportunity. The arrangements I have outlined are designed to encourage and assist people in the transition from reliance on welfare payments to full-time employment. I will continue to keep all of the employment incentives under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
        <P>We must stop talking illusory economics where the psychology is that if one keeps repeating that it will be all right on the night, it will be. Is it not the position that the community employment scheme participants are disqualified from receiving rent allowance once their income exceeds &euro;317.43? Is it not the position that this rule acts as a complete disincentive to lone parents to seek employment or training?</P>
        <P>The best way out of poverty is through employment. Schemes, such as the community employment scheme, have provided a marginalised section of the community with the chance for further education, training and the opportunity to enter the workplace. If we are serious about bridging the gap between rich and poor, we need an imaginative approach to education, training and employment opportunities. This means the income eligibility threshold must be increased to &euro;420 as it has not been raised for several years.</P>
        <P>Community employment scheme participants have written to me, claiming they are the victims of the latest Government scam to reduce rent allowance greater than 50% and yet receive an increase in the scheme&rsquo;s benefits of &euro;14 per week. How can anyone be satisfied with this? How could anyone have the gall to claim the peoples lot is improving? This is arising as a direct result of the failure of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to raise the income limit for tapered rent allowance.</P>
        <P>A lone parent on a community employment scheme receives &euro;350 and is automatically over the limit. Conditions attached to participating in the community employment schemes are strict. A participant has to be in receipt of low income to be eligible for the scheme. People in need of help are being forced to drop out of the scheme to qualify for rent allowance. Is this right? Is it right that we have not ensured those disregards have been adjusted in line with inflation to facilitate people&rsquo;s transition into the workplace, particularly when in the past seven years, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has returned &euro;850 million to the Department of Finance. Some of these moneys could have been used productively for the back to education allowance and the community employment scheme.</P>
        <Col N="1582" />
        <P>Will the Minister undertake a review of all disregards that have been static for several years? They have only served to exclude people because of the failure to index link the bands and limits, leading to automatic deprivation of eligibility for those schemes. It is no use giving a person a coat if one proceeds to cut the buttons off it; it will not keep him warm. Let us stop the codology and raise the limits to ensure participants in these schemes get an opportunity to participate productively in the economy. We will see the fruits of it in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>Limits are adjusted from time to time, often in the budget. I will keep these income limits under review. However, it is a battle of choices where sometimes we need to increase rates rather than move limits. It is often a trade-off. I have given the Deputy the overall increase in welfare expenditure. This year we have tried to target it at increasing the rates rather than moving the limit. I take the Deputy&rsquo;s argument that one has to continue working on both issues.</P>
        <P>I am aware the income level of single parents who take up community employment places exceeds the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit. However, this does not exclude them from receipt of rent or mortgage interest supplement as they have the option of being assessed under standard supplementary welfare rules.</P>
        <P>A lone parent can retain the one parent family payment in addition to receiving the community employment payment. That puts him or her in a more favourable position than an unemployed person whose community employment wage replaces his or her social welfare payment. I am conscious of the effect of these thresholds in getting people back into employment.</P>
        <P>I saw the figure of &euro;850 million in a recent newspaper article. The Department is not sending back money as such. The reason it did not spend what it was budgeted for is that unemployment was not as high as estimated. In that sense, it is good news rather than bad news.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the way in which the poverty trap inherent in the payment of rent assistance will be addressed when the rental accommodation scheme is fully rolled out later in 2005; if it was considered in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy; if so, the conclusions which were drawn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[22707/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement scheme, administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, is to ensure that private sector tenants who are not in full-time employment or full-time education have a guaranteed minimum amount of <Col N="1583" />income with which to meet their basic day to day needs after paying rent. It is a short-term income support measure, rather than a long-term housing measure.</P>
        <P>The scheme includes a variety of income disregards in determining the amount of assistance to be provided in individual cases. It is flexible, particularly for unemployed people who seek to get back to work or into community employment or training under the various relevant State schemes. That will remain the position after the new rental accommodation scheme arrangements commence for longer-term recipients.</P>
        <P>While the objective of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support as opposed to addressing long-term accommodation needs, a significant number of people had come to rely on rent supplements on a long-term basis over recent years. The Government announced an initiative in July 2004 aimed at meeting these long-term housing needs. The new system gives local authorities responsibility for meeting long-term housing assistance needs, including the needs of those people on rent supplements for 18 months or longer. These needs will be met through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>The aim of the new system is to minimise ongoing dependence on rent supplement by progressing to a situation where suitable long-term accommodation is available for all who need it. The rent supplement scheme will continue to meet the short-term needs of people for accommodation. This will be achieved within three years from commencement of the new arrangements in each local authority and in any event no later than September 2008.</P>
        <P>The level of rent charged by local authorities under the new scheme is a matter for each local authority. Arrangements in that regard have not been finalised but are well advanced. Rent levels will be set in a manner broadly consistent with the current local authority differential rents system. This system does not distinguish between sources of income in determining the appropriate rent payable in each case.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, while the overall income level of the household will determine the rent payable under the rental accommodation scheme, there will be no specific restrictions on employment. Participants on rental accommodation schemes will be free to take up work or extend their employment hours as they wish, with some appropriate adjustment made by the local authority to their rent levels to reflect their increased income.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements for people with longer-term accommodation needs will be fully in accord with the thrust of the national anti-poverty <Col N="1584" />strategy. Similarly, I consider that the rent supplement scheme remaining in place for people with shorter-term needs is an assistance towards poverty alleviation for low-income households.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy">
        <NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
        <P>My experience of rent supplement is that it deters people from going to work. I do not have a problem with the concept of local authorities taking significant responsibility for what is a housing issue. However, I want to ask some questions regarding problems with the scheme or perhaps to elicit more information about it.</P>
        <P>The public service embargo will have a bearing on the ability of local authority staff to turn the voids, or housing stock that has remained vacant for longer than six months, around quickly and to find accommodation. People may be caught between both systems. People may be obliged to travel distances or to spend long periods waiting for officials on the telephone, which will add to their costs. In cases where people currently visit health board offices, will the Minister consider using those offices to cut down on that cost or will he ask local authorities to do so?</P>
        <P>Many aspects of this scheme could be problematic for particular individuals. For example, if a family goes over the income threshold which entitles it to be on the housing waiting list, presumably it will be automatically cut off. However, the situation may arise whereby elderly parents or parents on low income have children living with them who could push them over the threshold, so that they suddenly disappear off the Richter scale. Will the scheme also be a way of stating that a person is accommodated, so that he or she disappears from the housing waiting lists without the State ever providing a permanent home for that individual?</P>
        <P>There are also difficulties about the voids being turned around quickly and local authorities could end up with a sizeable bill. It is difficult to figure out what will happen. Will the Minister respond to this point? After three years, when the scheme is rolled out, will local authorities be provided with the resources to continue this scheme? There appears to have been silence on that point and there are all sorts of legal difficulties. Basically, the Minister has told the House that people who currently cannot get rent assistance if they are in employment will be able to go to work if they are on the list for 18 months and join this scheme. They will pay a differential rent, a portion of the rent that would normally apply. Is this the change in how housing applicants will be considered? If so, it will result in the possibility of some applicants going to work, which is something from which they have been excluded. Is my understanding of the new scheme correct in this regard?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for the question and her helpful suggestions, which I will consider. I would be happy to arrange for senior officials to meet the Deputy to take her through <Col N="1585" />the details of the scheme if she wishes. As to her question, this is a new scheme. I expect 4,000 households will be facilitated under the rental accommodation scheme by the end of 2005. This year, I have transferred &euro;19 million from my Department to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to enable the process to get under way. I am disappointed that no one has yet been housed under this scheme. However, I am assured that this will begin in the coming weeks and I urge all concerned to make better progress than is currently being made.</P>
        <P>The evidence I have on file demonstrates that there is an increased reliance on rent supplements. In a sense, the numbers are frightening in that the number of people who are in receipt of rent supplement has increased by 35% in four years, from 42,000 to almost 60,000. The taxpayer is now paying &euro;370 million into that scheme, compared with &euro;150 million in 2000. The evidence behind those figures shows that people are beginning to rely on rent supplement as a permanent means of housing.</P>
        <P>Therefore, it was decided that once a person spent 18 months in receipt of rent supplement, the Department would transfer him or her to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who would have responsibility for finding permanent accommodation by whatever means possible, principally through a more permanent type of rental scheme.</P>
        <P>Some 30,000 people, which is a large number, have been in receipt of rent supplement for more than 18 months. Therefore, through the funding I provided, I expect the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as well as local authorities to move on and start to facilitate those people. The number of 4,000 is the target for the end of this year, but we have some distance to go.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy">

        <P>Local authorities already have problems delivering the housing programme. In the absence of extra staff, I believe this simply will not happen. No additional resources were provided in the budget and the embargo has not been lifted so I am seriously concerned that these funds will be returned without anyone being housed by this scheme.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether the social welfare system here gives adequate recognition and support to women and to the role of women in society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[23747/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>A key objective of my Department is to ensure that the range and level of social security coverage is appropriate to the <Col N="1586" />social and economic circumstances of different groups, including women, and that the services for which people are eligible are readily accessible and delivered in an efficient, effective and integrated way.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant increase in the level of social protection available to and being accessed by the female population over the past 20 years. Improvements in the comprehensiveness of social welfare schemes, including an increased recognition of the importance of caring through the homemakers schemes and carers payments points to an ongoing commitment to women in recognising the value of their work outside the formal labour force.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting carers and this is demonstrated by the significant budget package of over &euro;34 million provided to improve the payment rates and respite supports for family carers. The Government has also concentrated resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme, which is normally paid directly to the mother. Child benefit is neutral <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> employment status and income levels of parents and therefore does not distort parental choice in respect of labour force participation.</P>
        <P>Over the period since 1997, the value of all social welfare payments has increased in real terms. In particular, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by 271% at the lower rate and 258% at the higher rate, compared with inflation of 30.6%. This level of increase is unprecedented and delivers on the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to parents.</P>
        <P>Increased participation by women in the formal economy has also led to higher levels of social protection afforded to women. The number of women at work rose by 420,000 in the period 1991-2003. In the past, the lower rates of participation in the paid labour market by women led to far lower levels of social insurance coverage for women, especially married women, than for men. By 2003, the number of single and married women in employment had more than doubled compared with 12 years earlier.</P>
        <P>The numbers of insured persons grew from almost 1.44 million in 1990-91 to nearly 2.53 million in 2002. The general increase in coverage of the social insurance system has been accompanied by a rise in female coverage and access to benefits so that of the 1.9 million workers insured for all benefits, that is, PRSI class A contribution, almost 48% are women and more than 293,000 contributors paid PRSI as self-employed contributors in 2002, of whom almost 23% were women. The rise in coverage is also reflected in the data on benefit take-up. Of all weekly social insurance based payments, 53.9% were made to women.</P>
        <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These include extended social insurance coverage and an easing of the <Col N="1587" />qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>These measures are of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults, age 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the non-contributory old age pension and a number of special increases have been given over several budgets in pursuit of this target. In addition, since October 2002, new pension claimants can opt to have the part of the payment in respect of their spouse or partner paid direct to that person.</P>
        <P>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. The scheme is being reviewed as part of the second phase review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The review is due for completion in the next few months and developments regarding the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will be considered in light of the review&rsquo;s conclusions.</P>
        <P>The one-parent family payment is designed to provide income support to parents, generally women, with insufficient means who have to parent alone. One of the objectives of the one-parent family payment is to encourage and facilitate lone parents to consider employment as an alternative to welfare dependency while at the same time supporting them to remain in the home if they so wish.</P>
        <P>Income support payments for lone parents are being reviewed in this context, particularly examining obstacles to employment for lone parents. The outcome will contribute to concrete proposals designed to better support and encourage lone parents in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities and a better future for themselves and their children.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am also giving serious consideration to the introduction of a second tier of child income supports, aimed specifically at families in greatest need. The current national action plan against poverty and social exclusion specifically targets women as one of a number of groups who are particularly vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion, with a view to reducing or eliminating their level of risk and incidence of poverty and improving their access to services such as health care, education and employment. The Government is committed to continuing efforts to assist and support women and ensure that they have a fair share of improvements in quality of life.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister did not read the question, but I asked whether the social welfare system gives adequate support and recognition to women. I take it the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. What <Col N="1588" />percentage of women over 65 get a State pension based on their own PRSI contributions? What percentage of women in employment are covered by an occupational personal pension and is the Minister happy with this number? What percentage of women involved in farming have a personal pension? Is it true that 90% of them have no such pension and is he happy with that? Is it true that 95% of all qualified adults are women and does he agree that the social welfare system reinforces women&rsquo;s dependence on men for income? What, if any, are his plans to make changes in this regard?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>I am referring to the role of women in society and asking whether the social welfare system gives adequate recognition and support to them. These questions are based on an article by the National Women&rsquo;s Council. I am told that 95% of all qualified adults are women. Does the Minister agree that the social welfare system reinforces women&rsquo;s dependence on men? In its programme for Government, did this Administration not promise to raise the qualified adult allowance to the same level as a non-contributory pension? As it is now three years on, will this happen and if so, when? What plans, if any, does the Minister have to make changes to allow relatives, mainly women, assisting in family businesses to get insurance under the PRSI system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>In effect the Deputy has raised with me the agenda of the National Women&rsquo;s Council. Obviously he met its representatives, as I also did. If I were in Opposition I would also go through their shopping list. When I met them I gave them some answers. While I do not have at my fingertips the detailed data the Deputy seeks, I will get them for him.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanton asked me how many women over 65 receive social welfare payments. It is estimated that approximately 83% of women over 65 years of age&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>I asked how many of them receive payments based on their own PRSI contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>Some 83% of women receive social welfare support in some form. Some 19,000 are supported as qualified adults on the pension of their spouses or partners. Approximately 90% of those receiving support have a payment in their own right. Many of these women receive widow&rsquo;s payments. At the end of January 2004, 32% of those in receipt of either an old age contributory or retirement pension were women. Some 63% of people receiving old age contributory pensions are men with 37% being women. It is interesting to compare this figure with those on non-contributory pensions where 58% of those <Col N="1589" />receiving non-contributory pensions are women with 42% being men. It is clear that women mainly receive non-contributory pensions and men mainly receive contributory pensions. This shows vulnerability, on which matter I will return to the House with some thoughts as soon as I have the opportunity.</P>
        <P>It is still Government policy to bring the qualified adult allowance up to 70% of the non-contributory pension. It is our intention to move towards that position over a number of budgets.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the issue of family members and PRSI with representatives of the IFA. Obviously the Deputy meets the same people I meet. We explained to them the partnership and company requirement etc. I am familiar with the issue and they are familiar with our response, which is that we will examine the issue with a view to responding. I assure the Deputy that the issues he has raised are on our agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>I ask for more details on the Minister&rsquo;s plans regarding the qualified adult allowance and the promise to bring it up to the full allowance. He has said this will happen over a number of budgets. Given that the promise was made three years ago, how many budgets will it take for this to happen? While I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that women, particularly older women, are at risk of poverty when compared with men, what does he intend to do to help people in such a situation? What are the plans and timescale for the qualified adult allowance and for helping older women at risk of poverty or in poverty because of the vulnerability acknowledged by the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The process of increasing the qualified adult allowance commenced with the budget for 2000 and a number of special increases have been given to qualified adults since then. While I know the Deputy referred to the ratio, the rate of the qualified allowance on the contributory pension now stands at &euro;138.50, which is 84% of the maximum rate of the non-contributory pension. In that case we have gone well beyond the 70% target. Obviously I cannot at this stage explain our budgetary strategy. We will certainly seek to make improvements in this area on an incremental basis.</P>
        <P>From the figures I gave earlier it is clear we have an issue regarding vulnerable women, particularly older women. I drew attention to this problem regarding occupational pensions. While I do not have the figure before me, from memory no more than 35% or so of women outside the public service who are in employment had an occupational pension and would need to rely on the State pension. I am giving considerable attention and thought to these issues which are complicated and do not have easy answers. However, the situation has improved as a result of substantial increases in welfare expenditure generally and women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce has increased dramatically. The combination of these <Col N="1590" />factors has reduced the risk of poverty for women in particular.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the reason for the delay in applicants receiving disability arrears from his Department; if it is due to a shortage of staff in processing claims; if many financially vulnerable clients must wait up to three months for their entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[23813/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. Every effort is made to ensure that customers receive all their entitlements as soon as possible following application.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to disability allowance is contingent on the applicant satisfying both medical and means conditions. To satisfy the medical condition customers submit a medical certificate from their general practitioner. A medical assessor of my Department examines the medical evidence submitted and, if necessary, asks the person to attend for a medical examination to establish if the medical conditions for the scheme are met. The weekly rate of disability allowance depends on the amount of weekly means the person has. Means are assessed on the basis of income which the person or the person&rsquo;s spouse may reasonably expect to receive in the year following the date of the claim. An officer of my Department gathers all the necessary evidence, including documentation, to make an assessment of a person&rsquo;s means. In certain circumstances a home visit may be necessary before the assessment can be completed.</P>
        <P>Inevitably, a period of weeks elapses while these investigations take place. This results in arrears accruing to the person. However, once a decision is made on the person&rsquo;s entitlement, the weekly rate is put into payment to ensure that the person receives ongoing payments as soon as they are due. Arrears accruing for the period from date of entitlement to date of first payment are then computed and issued as soon as is practicable. Many claimants are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance or other primary social welfare payments during this period. The amount of such overlapping payments must be established and deducted when computing the net arrears due. Having regard to the time it takes to decide on applications for disability allowance in the first instance and subsequently to calculate and issue the appropriate amounts of arrears due, it is inevitable that a number of weeks will elapse before these matters are finalised in any case.</P>
        <P>One of my Department&rsquo;s priorities is to minimise the time lags involved in processing new claims and any associated arrears due. Targets are set for claim processing, including calculation and payment of arrears, but pressures can arise at certain times due to claim volumes, as a result of which these targets are sometimes not met. My <Col N="1591" />Department makes every effort to ensure, however, that payments are made as quickly and expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of disability allowance applications received by my Department in the first six months of 2005. A total of 10,500 applications have been received, compared with 8,700 in the first six months of 2004. In this context, priority has, in the first instance, been given to processing entitlements to the allowance. Consequently some delays have been recently experienced in the processing of arrears of disability allowance. Staff resources, which have become available as a result of the successful completion of another project in the disability allowance area, are being dedicated to the processing of arrears to reduce the number of cases awaiting decision. The situation will continue to be closely monitored to ensure that service improvements are effected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
        <P>I will be interested in seeing the additional information. We are talking about vulnerable people in bad health. The Minister has spoken of delays in terms of weeks. I have heard of one particular case where a person was waiting for up to three months. I have been told there is a problem within the Department and that people were on long-term sick leave. How long are people actually waiting? What is the longest waiting period? Is the embargo on public servants the cause of the problem? There may not be enough people in the Department processing the forms.</P>
        <P>How many staff are working in this area? Is it a matter of training people if others are out for the long term? Have people been waiting for six months? The Minister mentioned that some can go to the community welfare officer. Many people will not go to the community welfare officer, due to pride or whatever. I know of one case which was successful in obtaining arrears with the help of the Department. However, there are many people who do not want to go down that road and they borrow from families and others. In light of the difficulties that seem to be emerging in this section, will the Minister carry out some kind of organisational review? These are some the most vulnerable people in society, they are ill and in need of this money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>In the first six months of 2005, 10,500 applications were received. That compares with a total of 8,700 in the same period last year so that is quite an increase. Currently, there are 3,422 cases awaiting calculation of arrears and 2,800 of these are for people who have been awarded the allowance. A total of 572 cases are for persons who have been given revised rates of payment. Out of the 3,422 cases in arrears, 925 are awaiting determination for longer than three <Col N="1592" />months. I am examining resources as a result of this information.</P>

        <P>It is Government policy to encourage people to participate in occupational and private pension arrangements, so they can maintain their pre-retirement standard of living when they retire. To this end, a range of measures has been introduced in recent years including personal retirement savings accounts, or PRSAs, mandatory employer <Col N="1593" />PRSA access where occupational schemes are not available, as well as an ongoing national pensions awareness campaign.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.7-?>
        <P>CSO figures for the first quarter of 2004 show that 52.4% of persons in employment have a supplementary pension. Out of a national workforce of around 2 million people, an estimated 900,000 do not have a private or occupational pension to boost their incomes in retirement. The coverage rate for women is 46.8% against 56.3% for men and it is clearly a situation which must be improved to ensure people make adequate provision for their retirement.</P>
        <P>The key target group for Government action in the supplementary pensions area represents those who are 30 years of age and over. The national pensions policy initiative suggested that up to 70% of this group will need to supplement their social welfare pension to maintain living standards in retirement. The most recent CSO figures suggest that 59.1% of people in this group have the necessary pension cover, a small increase on the 2002 figure of 57.4%.</P>
        <P>Over the past three years the pensions board has run a national pensions awareness campaign which is designed to increase awareness of pensions issues among the public and to encourage pensions take up. A total of &euro;1 million was spent on the campaign through 2003 and 2004 and further resources have been allocated to facilitate the campaign in the current year.</P>
        <P>As well as raising general awareness, the campaign has also focused on areas of the country and sections of the population with lower levels of pensions take-up. The 2004 campaign featured a number of special promotions aimed specifically at women. There is no doubt that progress on pensions coverage is being made as there has been a steady increase in the number of people taking out PRSAs and in those participating in occupational schemes. The latest figures from the pensions board show that almost 51,000 PRSAs have been taken out up to the end of March 2005. Just under 80% of these are standard PRSAs with the remainder being non-standard.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The most recent data on the age profile of PRSA contributors relate to December 2004 and indicate that just under 50% are aged 35 or over, with 9% under 25. It is not possible to comment on the adequacy of the contributions being made as information on the income and contributions of individuals is not available. However, overall pensions coverage is increasing at a lower rate than is desirable. The reasons for this are many and varied and include issues of affordability and the fact that many people feel they are too young to consider pension provision.</P>
        <P>In February 2005 I asked the pensions board to commence work on a comprehensive review of our overall pensions strategy in advance of the previous timeframe of September 2006. A one-size fits all retirement regime may not best reflect the needs and wishes of Irish people in the 21st century. The review encompasses an examination <Col N="1594" />of the main strategic recommendations contained in the national pensions policy initiative including those relating to the adequacy of income in retirement, coverage targets, levels of social welfare pensions, sustainability of State pensions and the tax support for private and occupational pensions. The review is also examining the question of alternative ways of addressing adequacy and coverage issues. The role the State might have in future pension provision is also being examined.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>At this stage I am not examining any particular measures but I am waiting on the conclusions of the pensions board before deciding on further action in this area. However, some type of mandatory regime is always an option and the pensions board is looking at this with particular regard to the position in other countries. I am aware of the potential of maturing SSIAs as a way of increasing pensions coverage and I have also asked the pensions board to look at how we might tap into the savings habit that has been created to develop attractive pension-based savings initiatives.</P>
        <P>Work on the review is ongoing and I am anxious to ensure that it is completed in the shortest possible timescale so I can review the position and decide what further action is required in this area. I expect to receive the report of the pensions board in September. This report will take account of the various submissions made to the board. Governments abroad are trying to deal with the challenge of funding pensions for an older population that is generally living longer and healthier lives. The situation here is by no means a crisis. The demographic situation remains favourable for the next ten years or so and this allows us time to address the issues surrounding our pensions system. It is essential, however, that we take action sooner rather than later so we can deliver on our commitment to ensure an adequate retirement income for all.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputies for tabling their questions and providing me with the opportunity to address the matter in the House. I am deeply concerned by the recent turn of events. It is a matter of great regret to me as well as to the Deputies that five persons have been committed to prison by the High Court. I share the Deputies&rsquo; wish to see the matter resolved as quickly as possible. Deputies will not, however, expect me to intervene in a decision of the High Court, which must be allowed to act independently. The last person who did so was a Minister of State who found himself out of a job very quickly.</P>
        <P>The best way to achieve a quick resolution of the matter in question is through constructive dialogue between the company and the representatives of the people concerned. Both parties must be willing to approach the difficulties with an <Col N="1598" />open mind. I am aware that efforts are being made by the company, the Council of the West and Deputies who are present in the House to resolve the issues which have arisen. I share the hope that the process will result in a settlement that is acceptable to both sides. The fact that 11 Private Notice Questions have been submitted on the issue reflects the genuine concern of Members on all sides of the House to ensure the matter is resolved.</P>
        <P>It might be helpful to outline for the House the circumstances of the Corrib gas field development in so far as my Department is concerned. The Department is responsible for the regulatory aspects of petroleum exploration and development. In the case of the Corrib gas field, authorisations were granted by the Department under a number of provisions. Under the Continental Shelf Act 1968, authorisation was given for the construction of the offshore installation within the continental shelf designated areas on 15 April 2002 by my predecessor. My predecessor also gave consent on 15 April 2002 for the plan for the development of the field under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960. Under the Gas Act 1976, as amended, consent was given on 15 April 2002 for the construction of a gas pipeline from the gas field through the offshore up to the terminal building. Under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended, a foreshore licence was granted on 17 May 2002.</P>
        <P>In accordance with EU directives, an environmental impact assessment statement was submitted with each application for consent or approval. In addition, my predecessor made 35 compulsory acquisition orders of rights over land &mdash; I stress that they were rights over land &mdash; and one compulsory purchase order of land under section 32 of the Gas Act, as amended. The purpose of the orders was to allow the developers to use certain privately-owned lands for the construction of a pipeline from the gas field up to the proposed terminal building in Bellanaboy, which is 7 km inshore. The consents and approvals granted by my predecessors are extant and the compulsory acquisition orders remain valid.</P>
        <P>The consent to construct a pipeline of 15 April 2002 under the Gas Act 1976 was subject to a number of conditions, among which was the requirement to seek approval to install and commission the Corrib gas pipeline. The developer&rsquo;s application for consent to install and commission the pipeline is being carried out in seven phases from the subsea to the terminal. The process commenced in 2002. Consents to install and commission have been issued for phases 1 and 2, the preparatory work of phase 3 and for phase 6. The Department is finalising its decision on the onshore pipeline, which is the remaining element of phase 3, and evaluating the company&rsquo;s application to install and commission the offshore pipeline, which is phase 4. The remaining phases 5 and 7 will be dealt with in 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The current dispute between the objectors and the developers relates to the onshore pipeline, <Col N="1599" />which is the remainder of phase 3. There are some objections to the granting of acquisition orders for way leaves by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources over certain lands to permit the installation of the pipeline. As part of its submission for consent to install and commission the onshore pipeline, the developers were required to submit a quantified risk assessment which addressed, among other things, potential risks to the public along the pipeline route. Since the onshore pipeline application was submitted to the Department in 2002, two independent assessments have been carried out on the quantified risk assessment. The pipeline design code was also assessed.</P>
        <P>The consultant who evaluated the onshore pipeline design code indicated that it had been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations. He indicated that, subject to compliance with conditions laid down by the Minister in his approval, the design was generally in accordance with best national and international industry practice. The quantified risk assessment has been put into the public domain. One of the assessments of it is already in the public domain while the second will be published in the next few days. The overall finding of the quantified risk assessment that the prediction of risk to the public from the operation of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline conforms to international criteria is supported by the latest report I have received. The plan of development approval, including the consent to construct a pipeline, took account of safety matters. It also incorporates the permits-licences to be issued by other regulatory authorities. To this end, I draw Deputies attention to the following.</P>
        <P>The plan of development approval was given subject to a number of conditions. Condition No. 3 stipulates:</P>
        <P LI="1">Approval by me for First Gas (commencement of Commercial production operations will be subject to amongst other things the receipt of a Letter(s) of Acceptance for all Corrib installations, pipelines and associated engineering infrastructure from an auditor to be appointed by my Department indicating that 3rd Party Independent Verification has been carried out and completed satisfactorily in relation to the development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, the planning process takes due account of all safety aspects, including public safety, in its determination. In this regard I draw Deputies&rsquo; attention to condition No. 15 of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s planning decision, which stipulates that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Before the commissioning of the gas terminal, the developer shall submit to the planning authority a certified Safety Audit in relation to the installation of the combined upstream pipeline and terminal elements of the development within the planning application <Col N="1600" />site, and the agreement of the planning authority shall be received.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Safety Audit shall be prepared and certified by an independent qualified and competent person or body. Such body or person, and the precise form of the Safety Audit, which shall include Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis of the specified combined components, shall be agreed with the planning authority.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Safety Audit shall also be submitted to the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources at the same time as it is submitted to the planning authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Thus the House will appreciate the concern of local residents in regard to the operation of the pipeline following commissioning and first gas. The comprehensive approval regime put in place by my predecessor envisages conditions in regard to the ongoing operation of the pipeline over the period of its life. I will ensure that an appropriate independent auditing and monitoring regime will be installed prior to any gas passing through the pipeline. This will ensure that best safety practices for the operation of the pipeline will be in place to my satisfaction. I intend to approach the design of such an independent regime on an open and consultative basis. I will ensure the concerns of local residents are taken fully into account in the design of such an independent auditing and monitoring regime and I will make a statement to the House in this regard when appropriate.</P>
        <P>Two assessments have been carried out on the QRA, one of which is already in the public domain and the second will be published in the next few days. The overall finding of the QRA is that the prediction of risk to the public from the operation of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline conforms to international criteria. The latest report on the QRA supports this conclusion.</P>
        <P>I hope the current efforts being made by Members in the House and by others outside will resolve the issues amicably and that the people who are in jail will be released very shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison">
        <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I remind the House that this matter concludes at 5 p.m. Eleven Deputies have submitted questions and I hope to accommodate them all but I can only do so if Members are extremely brief in their supplementaries, no more than two minutes, to give the Minister ample time to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that it is extremely regrettable and disgraceful that James Brendan Philbin, Willie Corduff, Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Seighin and Philip and Vincent McGrath are in Cloverhill Prison tonight over this matter? The legal advice the Labour Party has obtained is that the contempt of court relates to a civil rather than a criminal matter. Would the Minister be prepared to ask the Shell oil company to waive its <Col N="1601" />rights in this regard to ensure that these five people are released while the work of our colleagues in the Council for the West and other bodies continues? Would the Minister prefer to take a proactive role in getting these citizens out of jail and preventing other citizens going to jail?</P>
        <P>I am sure colleagues will have questions on the quantified risk assessment. Is it not outrageous that the review was carried out by a company owned by Shell and BP? In other words, there was a clear conflict of interest. The Minister told me on 15 June that he was carrying out a review of the safety aspects of the pipeline. This has not yet been completed and the Minister cannot tell us anything this evening. Undoubtedly, the safety aspect of the pipeline is far outside the technical design scale. The Minister has a responsibility to bring forward this review and make it public as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister said this pipeline is unique in the world because it is going through a populated area. For that reason, he has a clear responsibility to ensure the safety of these people in prison, their families and the people they represent in north Mayo. Is it not a fact that the rights of way legislation which only applied to public sector companies was changed by a predecessor of the Minister? The former Minister, Deputy Fahey, said that in the national interest he was allowing the construction of this pipeline by a private multinational company. Was that not an outrageous decision to make in regard to a private enterprise operation which gravely affects many families?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister take a proactive role and appoint an arbitrator to liaise with local people, interested local representatives and other bodies to try to resolve this matter and to get these people home as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND">
        <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister referred to talks, but talk is cheap. I would not hold out much hope for these talks. The fundamental issue is that these people are in jail because of the situation that has developed. Their lives are in peril. How will talks sort this out? The Minister is the one with ultimate responsibility for this situation. Shell obtained planning permission without going through the same regime as I or anybody else would have to go through. It got <i>carte blanche</i>.</P>
        <P>The Minister is the only one who can sort this out. He must intervene and stop Shell from obtaining any more consents and make sure a safe system is in place. A pipeline attached to an offshore terminal would be much safer. This is the responsibility of the Minister. The QRA is based on the work of JP Kenny, which is the company that did the original work on the pipeline which was initiated by Enterprise Energy, formerly Enterprise Oil, that was taken over by Shell. How can the QRA be independent when the company that carried it out was 50% owned by Shell? The information was flawed from the beginning, so how can it be independent? Those people are in jail because they do not feel safe. <Col N="1602" />What the Minister has said will not make any difference.</P>
        <P>An investigation must be carried out into how companies can collude with Shell and the Government to get around the planning laws. The deals done in 1987 and 1992 were sweetheart deals that gave the oil companies a 25% tax rate which they can write off against all their operations in Ireland. There is a need for an independent oil inspectorate. We need answers but we are not getting them. Those people are languishing in jail purely because of fear. Talk will not solve the problem. The Minister is the only one who can solve it. He can do so by refusing any more consents and by insisting the gas is brought onshore in a safe way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
        <P>The issue here is whether it is safe to have a pipe with highly pressurised untreated gas up to 340 bar with a heavy moisture content going across land that in some cases has up to 10 m of bog. Effectively, a bog of that depth is a watery body which would mean the pipe would be a floating one in a watery body. It is not just an ordinary 80 bar gas pipeline that Bord G&aacute;is might run, but one with a very high pressure at certain locations with impurities and other materials in it that would be potentially hazardous to people or houses in the vicinity if they were to escape. That is the issue of concern.</P>
        <P>We have been concerned about this for a significant period. In two years of examining this matter, I have yet to get a straight answer that it will be safe and that a bog movement of some kind would not endanger such a pipeline and put people in the vicinity at risk. The former Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated that the pipeline met international codes, yet in his reply to a question on 8 July 2004 stated that there were no international design codes dealing with gas pipelines in peat bogs. Is that not one of the problems? In response to a question asked by me on 7 July 2004, he stated: &ldquo;When the final application to install the onshore pipeline for phase 3 is received, the issue of deep peat soil will be examined along with all other matters such as design, trench depth and compliance with conditions attaching to pipeline consent of 15 April 2002&rdquo;. I have yet to see this analysis or to have any credible analysis presented to me.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated today that the original quantified risk assessment has been published. Is he referring to the Andrew Johnson report of 28 March last? It presented some very serious caveats and concerns about the project and described the pipeline as very unusual. The former Minister issued consent therefore barely a couple of weeks after the issuing of the report during one of his last days in office.</P>
        <P>The Minister specified that all the relevant public documents have been presented. If so, and if I have them in my possession, I am still uncertain about the safety of the pipeline. This is what concerns the residents and what has them in their <Col N="1603" />current difficulties. The Minister, therefore, should be absolutely open and take the side of the people in ensuring the pipeline is safe rather than that of the developers in ensuring it proceeds as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
        <P>I want to make a number of points to the Minister. There are 500 people in Rossport. A number of people who were working for Shell and associated companies have walked away from the pipeline project today in support of the people who have been jailed. My first priority concerns the influence of the Department, including the Minister, on Shell. By God, it has a great influence on Shell because the door was always open for the company whenever it wanted to walk in, particularly under the previous Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Can the whole project be reassessed by way of an independent inquiry into the behaviour of the Department regarding the planning process, the way in which the door was opened for Shell and the way the residents of Rossport and the surrounding areas have been treated?</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister not released the first risk assessment report? Before further consent is issued to Shell, that report and all other relevant reports should be released and the people should be allowed sufficient time to examine and discuss them.</P>
        <P>On phase 3 of the pipeline project, will the Minister confirm whether Shell has his consent to continue with its work or is it breaking the law? Under what planning legislation did he give the company permission to build sheds, huts and other developments at Rossport without going through the planning process? How is the company allowed to do this?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Will the Minister consider seriously an independent evaluation of the project and consider other ways of bringing in the gas rather than by upsetting, disturbing and destroying the lives of people who did not ask for the pipeline to come by their doors and who did not want it to do so? There are now five innocent people in jail &mdash; five citizens of this State &mdash; who have been let down by the Minister, his predecessor and the rest of the Government because the door was open for a multinational company. By God, I am sure the tent will be also open at the Galway races in two weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
        <P>I have always favoured the bringing ashore of the Corrib gas field product, but on the basis that it should be done in accordance with the highest possible standards and without infringing people&rsquo;s rights. Five constituents of mine, and of other Deputies, from Rossport are in jail today because of contempt of court. This House cannot do anything about it unless they purge their contempt by indicating to the court that they will not obstruct the oil company. They are not prepared to do so because they have legitimate fears concerning health and safety. Is the <Col N="1604" />Minister prepared to intervene to appoint an intermediary to discuss this matter with the persons involved, or their representatives, and Shell, Mayo County Council and relevant State agencies? The matter will not be sorted out if it is left as it is. The depth of conviction of the five constituents is such that they are quite prepared to stay in jail, and be joined by others if necessary.</P>
        <P>Is there a difference of opinion between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the High Court? I understand the judge indicated that Shell, while it does not have consent to lay the pipe, is entitled to do so, but that if it is not laid in accordance with the proper conditions it might have to be dug up. Is there a difference of opinion in law and in fact regarding the company&rsquo;s right to do what it is doing, given that it has not received signed consent from the Minister? Was it a case of marking the wayleave for the pipe? Had the company authorisation, without the Minister&rsquo;s consent, to do what it has done?</P>
        <P>Most important, is the pipeline safe? The Minister stated in a recent reply to Deputies that he would see to it that all public safety issues related to the operation of the pipeline would be addressed prior to its commissioning. Either the pipeline is safe or it is not. Is there evidence from other places in the world where a similar incident has occurred to suggest that such a pipeline is safe? Can the Minister give a categoric assurance to the House that the pipeline in Rossport, which is to carry untreated gas at such pressure, is safe?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister undertake to release the two assessments that were carried out, one of which is already available and the other of which is to be published in a few days? If the imprisoned Rossport residents decide to purge their contempt and be released, is the Minister prepared to ensure, from direct discussions with the company, that it will not take any further action regarding the pipeline from the seapoint to the terminal until such time as all the issues regarding health and safety risks are clarified?</P>
        <P>There is some concern about the compounds that were provided close to the terminal, as raised by Deputy Ring. Did they require planning permission? This is a straight question and deserves a clear answer.</P>
        <P>The five men who have been imprisoned will not come out of jail unless their legitimate fears about health and safety are addressed. It requires political intervention on the part of the Minister to appoint an intermediary or mediator who can discuss all the relevant matters rationally with all the agencies and interests involved and arrive at a solution.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the Minister&rsquo;s indication that it is possible the prisoners could be released very shortly. The judge said yesterday they cannot be released unless they purge their contempt. They are not prepared to do so unless these matters are addressed thoroughly. Herein lies the Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="1605" />constitutional and political responsibility. Will he address the points I have raised in his reply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn">
        <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
        <P>The first point the Minister made is correct, that is, a resolution to this dispute can only be achieved through negotiation. However, as long as the five men are in jail, there will be no negotiation. The local people of Rossport are not prepared to negotiate without them. An opportunity must be created by the Minister to facilitate talks. The jailings have created tension throughout County Mayo and are regarded as very unfair. The heavy hand of the law has been wielded against ordinary, decent family men. This does not help to advance the project for Shell and it is keeping men from their families. The Department cannot remain remote because, as the Minister correctly stated, he most definitely does have a role to play, particularly with regard to giving consent. Perhaps the Minister would provide clarity because there seems to be some confusion among local people. Does the consent allow for Shell to go in and peg out the way leave for the laying of the pipe? Is it correct to state that consent for the laying of the pipe has not yet been granted? The Minister must consider the matter very carefully before he advances any further on the issue of consent, particularly in light of the present situation.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned that the QRA is in the public domain, but that is not correct. It is not in the public domain because the Minister&rsquo;s Department will not allow it. It has asked for the QRA not to be published at the present time until all consents are available. However, as the Minister told the House, all consents have not been granted at this time.</P>
        <P>It is proposed not to odorise the gas in the pipeline from the well-head to the terminal. When it passes by these people&rsquo;s houses, it will do so without any odour. Bord G&aacute;is usually odorises gas so that leaks can be detected. Can this concern be simply rectified? Will the Minister consider the matter?</P>
        <P>The position will escalate and more people will be available to go to jail. There will be no movement whatsoever on the project unless the Minister takes matters into his own hands. We do not want him to interfere with the High Court decision, but he can create an environment in negotiation with Shell and the local community for this matter to be resolved. The men should be able to purge their contempt without any loss of face. Why should they lose face? They have done nothing wrong except try to defend their own interests and resolve safety fears. There is no need for anybody to lose face if the Minister creates the environment to make negotiations possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister confirm that there is no barrier to him asking Shell to pull back from confrontation and lay off until the issues are fully discussed and resolved? Does he not find it extraordinary that the High Court is giving every <Col N="1606" />benefit to a major corporation over the small people of Mayo? Is it not incredible that a full hearing of the issues of concern to the people of Mayo will be heard in the autumn, probably in October? In the meantime, the company is allowed to proceed and put everything in place with the like-minded reminder from the High Court that the pipes will have to be taken out again if the decision goes against Shell. Is it not incredible that the courts take this view before the Minister has given his consent and before the most recent risk assessment report is put into the public domain? The High Court has given every benefit to Shell at the expense of the small people, which is what happened when the Minister&rsquo;s colleague wanted to publish a report into exploitation at Gama. In that instance, the courts would not allow it to be published until the substantial hearing was held thus once more facilitating a powerful company.</P>
        <P>Why is Shell so bullish and confident that it will get its pipelines come what may? Has it been secretly assured by the Minister, his predecessor, the Government or Fianna F&aacute;il that it will get its gas in the way it wants regardless of the genuine fears and concerns of decent local people? Has the Government not fallen over itself on every occasion to facilitate the company? It is a terrible scandal for a Government to give an entire gas field to multi-national corporations without a penny in royalties for the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
        <P>Like other speakers, I would like the Minister to take a personal interest in the situation. Regardless of what has happened in the past, he must now confirm that all health and safety regulations are being complied with in full and that state of the art technology is being used to ensure that safety measurements are taken in accordance with the law and well above the required tolerance.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister prepared to intercede with a view to Shell suspending operations for a short period to facilitate negotiations in which the Minister and others can play a part with a view to identifying some kind of common ground? Purging of contempt is the only way to comply with the court order. However, as Deputy Kenny pointed out, that cannot happen in this case because the people now in prison strongly believe they are correct in their views. The object of the exercise now is to ascertain the extent to which the Minister can ensure that reason will prevail. A short time must be given in which to enter into negotiations that might result in an accommodation to enable the men in prison purge their contempt.</P>
        <P>I have experience of this type of situation and am conscious of the points raised by several other Deputies. The current situation is intolerable. Regard must always be given to the rights of the individuals who live and work in any area when a development is taking place. It is possible to grant permission to allow developments to take place but it must be done against the backdrop of <Col N="1607" />the rights and entitlements of people who live and work in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND">
        <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister said he would like to facilitate constructive dialogue. What is he specifically doing about the matter? We need dialogue and negotiation because the situation is escalating. The Minister is the one with direct responsibility so what is he doing to facilitate dialogue?</P>
        <P>Is the second QRA based on the work done by JP Kenny? If so, will the Minister insist that a totally independent QRA is commissioned before he gives his full and final consent?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that people have genuine concerns which have not been fully and properly addressed? He spoke of the prediction of risk to the public and that it conforms to international criteria. What does that mean exactly? If the pipeline is unique, to use the Minister&rsquo;s words, and if the location of bogland adds to that uniqueness, what international criteria are we speaking of?</P>
        <P>What is Shell mandated to do at this time? What is it not allowed to do? I understand that it can mark way leaves and routes but not any excavation. Why is Shell pursuing the matter at this time if it does not have full consent? When does the Minister propose to make a final decision regarding the onshore pipeline? The Minister mentioned the work of the Council for the West. I reject the criticism of the council, which, on a voluntary basis, is making a quiet, sincere and genuine effort to try to resolve this very difficult situation.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister ask Shell to temporarily waive its rights in this situation, allow the men out of jail and ask the company not to proceed until a full and completely independent assessment is carried out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF">

        <P>I will be brief because of time constraints. I appeal to the Minister to use whatever means he has at his disposal to get the men out of jail and begin negotiations with Shell. This action is vital. I support gas being brought ashore but not at any cost to the people of the area. The Minister should seek a worthy solution to the problem in the next day or so.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Harkin, I compliment the Council for the West for doing a good and quiet job in getting negotiations under way.</P>

If we could work on trying to resolve the issue, it would be very helpful for everybody.</P>
        <P>Deputies raised the issue of the QRA and why it is not available. The QRA, version F, which is the one we are operating on, is in the public domain on the Department&rsquo;s website. There were quite a number of questions on whether the pipeline is safe and rightly so, given the safety con<Col N="1609" />cerns raised by the families directly involved. I can only judge this issue by the reports and the expert advice that I receive. I am not an engineer, no more than most of the Deputies who spoke. All the advice I have is that the pipeline conforms to international standards and criteria and that the risks are within the normal international criteria. That is the information I have and that is the basis on which I must act. I cannot act in an arbitrary manner in relation to the matter.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies raised a specific question, the answer to which might be helpful in providing the breathing space that is required in this situation. The basic question was whether Shell has permission to lay the pipeline at this time. It has not got the consent to do that. It has the consent, as Deputies have indicated, to mark out proposed routes and so forth, but it does not have the consent to lay the pipeline immediately. It cannot enter the lands to lay the pipeline at present.</P>
        <P>Regarding the allegation that Shell has been allowed to ignore planning rules and procedures, I outlined earlier the various consents that the company had to get before proceeding. It had to get the plan of development approval, the pipeline consent to construct, the foreshore licence and consents under the Continental Shelf Act 1968. Those consents date back some time, in one case to 1968, and the company had to comply with each one. That is the procedure we agreed in this House for the construction of pipelines. To my knowledge, Shell has complied with all of those consents so far.</P>

The concern of all Deputies in raising this matter is to try to resolve the current difficulties. I have a particular role regarding the consents and in essence, I am a regulator in this area, so I am precluded in terms of how I might intervene in the dispute. Efforts being made by the Deputies themselves and by the Council for the West should be given every opportunity to succeed. I understand dialogue is taking place. I am prepared, if it is of any benefit and if nothing comes of that dialogue, to nominate an intermediary. However, there is not much point in appointing an intermediary if either side is going to adopt an attitude that nothing is going to change or if the parties decide not to listen to one another. That would be a futile exercise. I hope and urge those involved, including the Council for the West, to try to reach some compromise. If all fails on that front&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to deal with the constructive criticisms put forward by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists which is very concerned that the protection of patients <Col N="1612" />is not being afforded the paramount importance it deserves by the protection of both titles, &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; and &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo;. The society has furnished to me a copy of its position statement which outlines the reasons its members believe this Bill must be amended to protect the public and avoid confusion when choosing a health practitioner. To the horror of ISCP members, its original position paper was passed to the Institute of Physical Therapy where it was altered and recirculated to all Deputies as the institute&rsquo;s own document. The ISCP is very concerned that Members are deliberately confused and misled on a very important issue. The ISCP has written to the institute to express its outrage at what has occurred. As a professional body representing health care professionals, the society is most concerned at this underhand way of presenting information.</P>
      <P>The impression is given of a battle between the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, ISCP, and the Institute of Physical Therapy. This could not be further from the truth. When the ISCP refers to physical therapists it is not just referring to those who attended the institute in Stillorgan for lessons but also to all other physical therapists who have completed courses elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The National Training Authority, Park House, Cabinteely, runs a home study course in physical therapy consisting of 24 lessons. No hands-on clinical practice is included and all teaching is carried out by means of manuals posted out to students. Having completed the 24 lessons, the newly qualified physical therapist can set up in private practice, without ever sitting an examination or seeing a patient. This is the reason the ISCP is so passionate about protecting the titles of &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; and &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; for those individuals who are eligible for membership of the ISCP and have completed a university degree course. It would be remiss of the society not to care about protecting the patient. Its members are health care professionals with a genuine interest in patient care, safety and well-being and it will do all in its power to ensure patients are not exposed to inferior treatment.</P>
      <P>The ISCP has no issue with those calling themselves &ldquo;physical therapists&rdquo; but it insists that if the public is to be protected and confusion avoided, the use of the title &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; must be changed to a title less similar to the title &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo;. I commend the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists for expressing its views and its president, Esther Mary Darcy, for informing Members of the House on this issue.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for the council to appoint a chief executive officer to carry out the management and administration of the council and registration boards and to act as the registrar of each registration board and perform any other duties determined by the council. The chief executive officer holds office under conditions of remuneration and allowances that may be determined by the council with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the <Col N="1613" />Minister for Finance. I encourage the Minister of State to be flexible and creative in the appointment of the chief executive.</P>
      <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the establishment of registration boards. The bodies are established on their prospective establishment days to perform the functions and exercise the powers assigned under this Act to the registration board of the designated profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Members have been intensively lobbied by two professions in particular. I will refer to the arguments put forward by both bodies.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an Act to provide for the establishment and functions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and of registration boards for certain designated health and social care professionals to provide for the registration of persons qualified to use the title of a designated profession and for the determination of complaints relating to their fitness to practise and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Health and Children said when introducing the Bill in the other House, statutory registration is best described as a system whereby individual members of a profession are recognised by a specified body as being competent to practise within that profession under a formal mechanism provided by law.</P>
      <P>I welcome this development which has been requested for some time. The Bill has been in preparation for a number of years. Unlike systems of voluntary registration, this is a legally binding process with a mechanism for the prosecution of offences. It is integral to the delivery of the commitment in the health strategy to strengthen and expand provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals. This is the first of three Bills to reform the regulatory environment for health professionals, with legislation for medical practitioners and nurses to follow.</P>
      <P>The aim is to protect the consumer and provide a reassurance that the professional is competent and qualified and is answerable to a body. In the past those who were not treated properly suffered and the mistakes were buried with them when they died. It was strongly emphasised in the health strategy that gaining people&rsquo;s trust in the health system is achieved by guaranteeing quality.</P>
      <P>People used to spend their money on material possessions such as homes, gardens, kitchens and cars, but now they are spending money on their health. Ireland is a richer country. People are better off. They have all the material possessions and now they are concentrating on their health and that of their families, especially their children. They want to live longer and healthier lives. As a result they expect a greater quality of service from the professionals they attend when they are sick or have concerns about their health.</P>
      <P>People want to know that the service they receive is based on best practice and meets <Col N="1614" />approved and certified standards. Improving quality in the health care system requires implementation of internationally recognised evidence-based guidelines and protocols and ongoing education and commitment from health care institutions and professionals. Trust requires that deficiencies in the system be identified, corrective action taken and future progress monitored. The principle of people-centredness includes ensuring that consumers are given greater control and greater responsibility for their own health and increased involvement of consumers as partners in planning and evaluation. This Bill involves members of the public more in regulating the professionals on whom they depend to ensure they have a long and healthy life.</P>
      <P>The legislation on statutory registration of health and social care professionals contains a comprehensive legal process for the investigation of complaints against individual professionals and that is to be welcomed. In light of the recent experience in Mayo and other experiences in different parts of the country, we all know that there will be a number of health therapists and others who will not come under the ambit of this Bill. Freelance operators in the health care industry must be answerable in some way for their activities. The professionals are answerable but the freelance health therapists are not. That is a contradiction in the Bill. This Bill is only the beginning of a process that must be continued in terms of dealing with people who advise on people&rsquo;s health on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Some such operators are neither qualified nor hold the necessary education qualifications and in the end the patient suffers except in some instances where by a stroke of luck the operators are successful in administering medicine that happens to work. How does the Minister or the Department propose to deal with that group of people, many of whom have no qualifications other than some cure was handed down to them or they may have attended a course for a few months and subsequently described themselves as professionals and set up in business? I would like the Minister of State, when replying, to refer to such freelance operators in health care.</P>
      <P>Strengthening and clarifying accountability and measurement mechanisms is a priority. Professionals now practise in a more demanding environment. Evidence-based guidelines tied to professional standards, the requirements of health care organisations and patients&rsquo; rights and expectations all add to these demands. That is another aspect of accountability strengthened by these legislative proposals. The establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals is therefore considered essential to the delivery of the quality and accountability objectives of the health strategy. It will ensure that members of the public are guided, protected and informed so that they can be confident that health and social care professions providing services are properly qualified, competent and fit to practise. These are all wel<Col N="1615" />come developments, but they will only apply to the people in whom we normally have trust. The legislation does not have a broader application.</P>
      <P>Section 4 designates the health and social care professions to be subject to the provisions of the Act, and they have been mentioned by a number of speakers. Members of a number of the professions were referred to with whom we would come in contact on a regular basis, such as chiropractors, acupuncturists and several more people who describe themselves as professionals. Some of these people would be described as a doctor of acupuncture. Many genuine members of different nationalities who have emigrated here practise in this field.</P>
      <P>Regulations covering the qualifications of such practitioners should be in place. Many practitioners, for example, a doctor of acupuncture, may be genuine but there should be a system whereby people could ask such practitioners dealing with the important issue of people&rsquo;s health to specify their qualifications and where they obtained them, and such qualifications should be checked. There should be some way of tracking where these people are from, where they got their qualifications and if their qualifications are recognised. There might be a European dimension to this aspect in terms of people who emigrate to member states of the Union. The EU might have a role in such regulation.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the matter of the concern of physiotherapists regarding this Bill. They were anxious that the title of physical therapist would attached to the physiotherapists and be protected. There is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister may in future designate other professions. That will be an ongoing process. Physiotherapists are concerned that people who describe themselves as physical therapists can continue to operate, and that is a genuine concern. They have briefed us comprehensively regarding their concerns and they have been read into the record by a number of speakers.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists have been practising here for 100 years. The first Irish school of physiotherapy was founded in 1905. Physiotherapy is a full four-year honours degree course. The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists has 2,000 members. Some 1,500 physiotherapists are employed by the Health Service Executive. Therefore, there are numerous physiotherapists and their organisation is influential.</P>
      <P>The first letter we got from them was dated 28 June. Deputy Paul McGrath referred to that and more or less read their concerns into the record of the House, so I will not repeat them. Have the Minister and his officials studied their concerns and given any commitments to the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists to the effect that in future physical therapists will be included in this Bill and that title would be protected? As a sportsman I have been in contact with a number of physiotherapists over the years and they are very professional. I have the highest regard for <Col N="1616" />them. The fact that they spend four years studying the discipline of physiotherapy is significant. In one sense it is a broad area, but in another sense it can be very specific. I spoke to a young woman recently who is currently studying physiotherapy in the University of Limerick. She advised me that she has spent the whole year studying anatomy alone. That must be very intensive, and obviously these people have an in-depth knowledge of how the body works, and how it is affected by various treatments. Treatment is becoming more complicated as we know. Interferential therapy and ultrasonic treatment was introduced some years ago and there are other types of treatment that require deep medical knowledge. Otherwise damage could be done, especially where bones are concerned.</P>
      <P>We have received a briefing from the Institute of Physical Therapy. I met a representative of the institute, whom I found to be very genuine. There are about 350 physical therapists in the country at the moment, although that figure varies. The Institute of Physical Therapy was established in 1989, unlike the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists whose first school was established 100 years ago. The institute was established in 1989 to pioneer a course in physical therapy in Ireland. Physical therapy is a holistic natural approach to the prevention and treatment of musculo-skeletal conditions. It is worth pointing out that unlike the physiotherapists, the physical therapists utilise a range of gentle hands-on techniques, including stretching and mobilisation, that have proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of most muscular related disorders. The physiotherapists use interferential therapy, ultrasonic treatment and other means for treating injuries. Generally speaking, the physical therapists use their hands more and just work on muscles and tendons, without going any further. The physiotherapists obviously give more advice as regards the internal workings of the body and how other parts of the body affect the muscular system as well. They have expertise in the area of diet and other disciplines, too. We have both of those disciplines at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the Institute of Physical Therapy offers a three year course designed for mature students. It is probably on at weekends and of its nature this could be regarded as part-time. However, most of the people who come through the institute have degrees already. Most of them are graduates, I understand, based on the submission we received. They are also very professional. I have come into contact with a few physical therapists, most of whom work with inter-county teams and generally speaking, they are very professional. They would not work with inter-county teams if they were not. If nothing else, this Bill has highlighted the conflict between the physiotherapists, on the one hand, and the physical therapists on the other.</P>
      <P>It is very important at this stage that the Minister should offer some view on the concerns of both professional bodies. Normally in the lead up <Col N="1617" />to a Bill we, as Deputies, are lobbied by various groups. However, the only people who have lobbied me are these two groups. It is important, therefore, that some clarity is given, based on the submissions of both of these groups, and it would be very helpful. It is more or less implied in the Bill that when people attend a certain therapist all the relevant documentation as regards qualifications, education and experience of the professional should be available. It is not just good enough to have letters after a person&rsquo;s name. Each professional should have a curriculum vitae setting out qualifications and the body of which he or she is a member.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the debate on it. One major issue of contention is the distinction between physiotherapists and physical therapists. I would like if the Minister could give the House a direction as to the future position of both these professional bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004. It is long overdue and in that context it is appropriate that it is being debated in the House before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Before I forget or run out of time, I ask the Minister to respond to the following question, when he is summing up. In view of the fact that a BSc in podiatry is listed under the Third Schedule as the minimum qualification required for registration and there is no school of podiatry attached to any university in the State, is it proposed to establish such a school at one of the universities and will the call for tenders go out before the end of this year? The Minister will be aware that at present students must go to the University of Ulster at Jordanstown or to one of 12 universities providing the course in Britain. In the context of that being referred to in the Bill it is important that the Minister clarifies the situation as regards access to that professional qualification.</P>
      <P>Few of us can disagree with the main objectives of the Bill to provide for the establishment of the health and social care professionals council as well as registration boards for certain health and social care professions. It also provides for the registration of persons qualifying to use the title of a designated profession and for determination of complaints relating to their fitness to practise, and related matters. How can these objectives be best realised, initially in this legislation and thereafter through its practical implementation? I am not convinced the Bill meets these objectives or addresses many of the outstanding issues.</P>
      <P>On reading the Bill, I was struck first by its elaborate structure. It provides for at least 180 appointments to be made to various councils and committees. Who will make these appointments? According to the Bill, this task will fall, by and large, to the Minister for Health and Children. The notion of jobs for the boys and girls is the first thought to come to mind. Unfortunately, the <Col N="1618" />record of such appointments over the years has been less than reassuring and this must be a concern for the public.</P>
      <P>Section 4 designates the 12 professions provided for in the Bill. It is appropriate at this stage to refer not only to the objective of having high standards in the professions, to which we all aspire, but also to the level of service being provided &mdash; or not provided &mdash; to the public. Many of the designated professions, for example, chiropodists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists, are vital to the community care service. In reality, however, the idea that community care is available is essentially a fallacy, particularly for older people. Surveys and reports have clearly shown that the vast majority of older people want to be cared for in their homes with minimum health service involvement. It is shameful that community care is totally inadequate and is not being delivered as envisaged.</P>
      <P>The availability and willingness of family members to care for their elderly relatives make the major difference in terms of keeping elderly people at home. Notwithstanding its many promises, the Government has failed to adequately acknowledge the role of community carers. Any debate on health and social care must include an acknowledgement of their role. The Labour Party has put this issue at the top of its agenda and will continue to vigorously pursue it. If the Minister fails to deal effectively with carers, the Government will feel the wrath of voters at the next election.</P>
      <P>The community care system must be developed to ensure older people receive the support they need and families providing care do not become isolated. Community care services are essential to achieving the aim of keeping at least 90% of people aged 75 years or over in their own homes. It is obvious to political representatives that insufficient finance has been provided to develop these services.</P>
      <P>The key community care services urgently required for older people and their carers are domiciliary nursing, general practitioner and home help services, respite and day care centres, meals and transport services, paramedic services and several of the services specifically referred to in the Bill, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, chiropody, speech therapy and social work. It is a scandal that, at a time when health and social care services are being put on a statutory footing, the availability of such services is restricted in the community. For example, medical card holders are obliged to make a contribution towards the cost of chiropody. In addition, according to the most recent figures available to me, the home help service, which is essential if we are to ensure people are cared for at home rather than in acute beds in hospital, was cut back by 300,000 hours in 2003 as compared to 2002. Is it not a scandal that while medical card holders are being deprived of the home help service to <Col N="1619" />which they are entitled, Minister after Minister has been returning departmental moneys to the Department of Finance?</P>
      <P>If we are to implement a comprehensive community care service that would reduce dependency on acute hospital beds, emphasis must be placed on the shortage of occupational therapists and chiropodists at Health Service Executive level. The delay in providing these services means costs of providing scarce services are being unfairly levelled on medical card holders. Furthermore, we must address geographical variations in service levels, which a number of delegations visiting the Houses have described. Surely a basic, uniform service should be available throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Representations received from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and the Institute of Physical Therapy made particular reference to the protection of title. Time and again, Deputies have highlighted the case expressed in the position paper submitted by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, which I have read.</P>
      <P>It is also important, however, to place on record the views of members of the Institute of Physical Therapy. During my sporting days I suffered major back problems and often sought treatment from experienced physiotherapists, and I have always found them to be highly professional. I must also acknowledge that physical therapists, who treat clients from sporting and general backgrounds, have built up 350 practices throughout the country. Clients come from both sporting and general backgrounds and are largely referred by existing clients.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Physical Therapy was established in 1989 to pioneer a course in physical therapy in Ireland. Physical therapy is a holistic, natural approach to the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. The therapist uses a range of gentle techniques, including stretching and immobilisation that have proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of most muscle related disorders. These are natural, drug free treatments that are individually tailored, do not conflict with conventional medical treatment and are founded on the principle of health science. It is safe and effective in the treatment of back, muscular and joint problems. In the 15 years since the institute&rsquo;s foundation, no physical therapist has faced a negligence claim.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Physical Therapy offers a three year course designated for mature students. The professional association of practitioners, the Irish Association of Physical Therapists, was established in 1992 and regulates the profession in Ireland. Physical therapy presents itself at all times as an alternative to physiotherapy and physical therapists explain to clients unsure of what to expect that the treatment is not available under a medical card.</P>
      <P>In its submission, the institute notes the Bacon report on the current and future supply and demand for physiotherapists forecasts a shortage <Col N="1620" />projected to last until 2016. The report recommended the immediate recruitment of physical therapists into the public service to address this. Any restrictions on the work of physical therapists will exacerbate the current shortages for many years and the removal of 350 therapists would have a negative impact on a health service already unable to cope.</P>
      <P>Both physiotherapists and physical therapists provide a service and we must ensure the public get the best possible service and have a choice of which they prefer and which will meet their needs. There is room for both professions to complement each other. They have worked together for the last 15 years and, irrespective of this Bill, they can coexist. The Minister can get it right in this Bill and I recommend that the Institute of Physical Therapy&rsquo;s recommendations are taken on board. She should not remove them from practice, which would be a negative step. We can deal with this in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Page after page of the Bill refers to the establishment of committees and mechanisms to deal with complaints. The Bill does not make it clear, however, how a person would go about initiating a complaint against someone who has been negligent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome but long overdue. It has been recognised for some years that better regulation of a range of health and social care professions is necessary. It is essential for the professions themselves and will ensure that only those who are properly qualified and subject to statutory regulations are allowed to practise the various disciplines outlined in the Bill. The public needs this statutory protection and guidance to be confident that those from whom they receive treatment are fully competent and accountable within their respective professions.</P>
      <P>Before addressing the Bill, it is appropriate to say something about the issues surrounding health and social care professionals in Ireland today. It must be recognised that care across a range of areas has improved, primarily as our knowledge has improved and led to a more detailed and specialised approach to all aspects of human health. This is welcome.</P>
      <P>The issue of accessibility, however, to the skills, knowledge and care of these professions is central in our health and social services. Access to care for many citizens is very difficult and is often denied for two reasons.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Our two tier public and private health system means the higher a person&rsquo;s income, the more likely he is to avail of the care provided by the professions listed in this Bill. The Bill covers those who work in the public and private sectors and the self-employed but the trend of our times, encouraged by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, is for more and more of these professions to be sucked into the private sector. At the same <Col N="1621" />time the public sector is starved of the professionals it desperately needs.</P>
      <P>The second reason for the inequity in accessibility is due to the shortage of persons practising in many of these professions. This is clear to us across the range of services addressed in the Bill. One only has to look at the desperate need for more speech and language therapists to provide services for children with special educational needs. Not enough speech and language therapists are being trained. For some reason, young people are not choosing it as a career in sufficient numbers, yet the system is crying out for more therapists. There is also a shortage of radiographers which often prevents state-of-the-art hospital facilities from coming on stream. The planned roll-out by the autumn of 2007 of BreastCheck with its static centres in Galway and Cork and mobile units for the rest of the country will require a large intake of trained radiographers and others within the associated professions. Despite this, I do not believe this is achievable or that those positions required will be recruited from within the indigenous complement. As with many other areas of health care, BreastCheck will have to look overseas to fill some of these positions.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to conduct a survey of the professions covered in the Bill to assess the state of play of each regarding supply to learn whether numbers in the professions are inadequate. In areas where they were found to be inadequate, one would find the private system receiving a disproportionate number of those trained in those professions and the public system losing out once again.</P>
      <P>A serious examination must be conducted into inequality in access to education. In wide sectors of society, young people do not aspire or have no expectation or possibility of ever being able to practice any of the professions covered in the Bill. We need to see greater activity on the part of the Department of Health and Children and the Government in informing second level schools to equip young people with the information to make informed career choices. I have no doubt many young people, owing to a variety of reasons, some of which I have alluded to, would never think of these real and live options for their career paths. As a result we are deprived of the talent of countless young people who could make an invaluable contribution to the health system.</P>
      <P>One great disadvantage of the health system and a barrier to progress within it is the elitism among medical professionals. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, called the hospital consultants kings in their own domain. I absolutely agree. Without diminishing the central role played by consultants and the higher echelons of the health profession in the system and the work most of them do, it must be admitted that for decades they were subject to too little accountability and scrutiny. Only the very privileged minority secured contracts which hospital consultants still enjoy and which the <Col N="1622" />Government has been attempting to renegotiate for years in an effort to ensure greater equity in hospital care for public patients. It appears the process is painfully slow.</P>
      <P>To cite one instance, in the Neary case we saw the total inadequacy of the Medical Council as a regulatory body. For years the victims were ignored and when the council was finally forced to take action, its investigation also took years. The victims of this practitioner were vindicated but were alienated from the body supposedly in place to ensure public confidence in the medical profession. Sadly, they have yet to receive justice.</P>
      <P>In his summing up, will the Minister of State explain where the medical profession fits into the picture? Where stands the promised medical practitioners Bill and the nursing Bill? These Bills are designed to provide for regulation in the same way as this Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on the promised Bills mirroring this one when Deputy Durkan has finished consulting him.</P>

      <P>No doubt it is good advice. To what extent has experience with existing and far from satisfactory regulatory bodies such as the Medical Council been taken into account? There is much experience to draw on and I am interested in what the Minister of State will say in this regard.</P>
      <P>I will reserve a detailed consideration of the Bill, as we will have an opportunity to do so during subsequent Stages. The general framework is acceptable. However, my major reservation is that all appointees to the health and social care professionals council are to be ministerial choices. Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have repeatedly raised this issue over many Bills. Once again it looms large in this Bill. The 25 members of the health and social care professionals council are all to be appointed by the Minister for Health and Children. The registration boards of the professions concerned will nominate 12 people. The nine to represent the interest of the public will be nominated by no one but the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the term &ldquo;the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rdquo; has been added to this provision. Perhaps the Minister of State will explain that particular addendum. My own suspicion is that it is there because the view prevails in Government that people accessing professional health care are consumers of commercial services rather than citizens with rights to proper health services. Whatever the reason &mdash; I look forward to the explanation &mdash; the representation for the public is inadequate and should be changed. On Second Stage, I commend a revisitation of that proposed configuration to the Minister of State.</P>
      <Col N="1623" />
      <P>As other Deputies have noted in the course of this debate, I have also been lobbied by bodies representing physiotherapists and physical therapists, and clearly there is a dispute between them about the name and nature of their respective professions. From the material submitted by these groups, it is clear that there is a dispute about basic facts. Only yesterday, I received a further missive from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists. The dispute is about such critical issues as training and, indeed, the qualification of physical therapists. Perhaps this Bill is not the place to resolve this complex issue. The Bill reflects a recognition of both, which is meritorious, but clearly as there is a serious disputation, I suggest that the Department consider initiating discussions between the groups in pursuit of agreement on how they can work in harmony and for the public benefit. If at the end of that process this Bill requires amendment, in any way reflective of that engagement, let that be done.</P>
      <P>Broadly, however, it is in the interests of both sets of professions and in the wider public interest that this disputation is put to rest. Some form of mediation is necessary and the Minister and the Department should consider what role they can play in helping the two sets of protagonists to come to a peaceful and harmonious conclusion to their dispute. I look forward to the opportunity to address some of the detail in later Stages of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this legislation. In a country where the provision of health care is such an important issue for the vast majority of its people, any legislation which deals with the provision of health care services is to be welcomed. By the nature of health care, it is essential that there is adequate regulation of the provision of services. I will not rehearse most of the arguments that have been made previously. I came to the Chamber specifically to deal with the issue to which I believe every speaker has referred in this debate thus far. Like other Members, I have received representations from both sides of the therapy issue, if one might so describe it. I felt that I should contribute to the debate as a user, at times a frequent user, as both patient and employer, of the services of both professions.</P>
      <P>My experience of both professions has been extremely positive, both as patient and as employer. I am speaking of my experience in the sporting arena, particularly during the past 15 years, when I was heavily involved with professional athletes who had a day-to-day requirement for the services provided by both physiotherapists and what are referred to as physical therapists. In general, my experience has been that as with any profession, the vast majority are expert practitioners and a few are not so expert. Obviously, the forthcoming regulation will affect the not so expert end of either sector. However, my impression was that the crucial factor for any <Col N="1624" />patient of either arm of the profession is the confidence of the patient in the professional administering the service, particularly in the area of sports injury, to which my experience is confined. The confidence of the athlete in the ability of the professional to rehabilitate the injury and get the athlete back into the sporting arena at the earliest possible opportunity was a vital component in the choice by the patient of the type of treatment and the individual by whom they wished to be treated.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, sports injury and the recovery from such injuries are topical at present. However, the manner in which our attention has been focused on the issue in the past week by the unfortunate injury to Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll in New Zealand tends to make us overlook the ordinary day-to-day bumps and bruises experienced and suffered by individual athletes in the daily practice of their craft and earning of their livelihoods. While such spectacular events receive wall-to-wall and angle-to-angle coverage across our television screens, for the athletes who train and engage in what by any standards is extremely rigorous physical activity, injury is part and parcel of their lives. It is an occupational hazard and the ability to recover quickly is a vital element of their day-to-day lives. In particular, the ability to recover more quickly than their opponents, or in this case the replacement, is vital. This ability can only be provided by a practitioner who is able to identify and treat the injury but also &mdash; this is particularly important &mdash; restore the individual&rsquo;s confidence that he or she is capable of returning to the arena and performing again to his or her maximum ability at the earliest possible opportunity. In my experience of both professions I found little if any difference. Probably the country&rsquo;s highest-profile practitioner in either craft in the sports area describes himself as a physical therapist. Jokingly he will describe himself as &ldquo;therapist to the stars&rdquo;. I have no intention of mentioning names, which would breach confidentiality. However, the list of names represents a &ldquo;who&rsquo;s who&rdquo; across the Irish sporting spectrum, including footballers, hurlers, rugby players and athletes both male and female. They attend that practitioner because of their confidence in him to deliver the service and their confidence when returning to the sporting arena that they are not putting themselves at unnecessary risk of aggravating the injury and thereby putting themselves to even greater discomfort and risking reducing their earnings.</P>
      <P>I understand from where the physiotherapists and the therapists are coming. In its letter dated 28 June, the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists states:</P>
      <P LI="1">This is why the ISCP is so passionate about protecting the titles of &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; and &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; for those individuals who are eligible for membership of the ISCP and having completed a university degree course... The ISCP has no issue with those currently calling themselves &ldquo;physical therapists&rdquo; continuing to practise but the ISCP insists that if the public <Col N="1625" />are to be protected and confusion to be avoided anyone using the title &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; must change their title to something that is less similar to the title &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I agree with some of the earlier speakers who regard this as an unseemly spat between two groups of professionals. The first few paragraphs of the letter from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists does not do any service to the debate or to either group of professionals. Any efforts to try to bring the parties together to resolve matters would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I believe a clear distinction exists and in due course that distinction would emerge in the eye of the public were the word &ldquo;chartered&rdquo; to be always used with the word &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; resulting in a clear distinction between a &ldquo;chartered physiotherapist&rdquo; and a &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;. From my understanding of both submissions one of the major difficulties is in the similarity of the names &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; and a &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;, particularly when they are spoken quickly. Using the word &ldquo;chartered&rdquo; would immediately remove the similarity and would draw a clear distinction between both. Its consideration is worth pursuing. It is somewhat ironic that the bottom of the letter from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists refers to that body being &ldquo;Members of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy&rdquo;. On the one hand it wants to draw the distinction between its members and physical therapists and on the other it is happy to be a member of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy. I am slightly confused.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;chartered&rdquo; is clearly important to chartered physiotherapists as it denotes a degree of qualification, which members of the other profession do not have. It emphasises to professionals and lay people alike that being a chartered physiotherapist requires a particular qualification, only achieved consequent on passing examinations of a particular standard and having attended a course of study of a particular standard, which makes it clearly distinct from physical therapy. I hope some light shines on both bodies allowing them to come together and resolve the issue. The ongoing dispute between both bodies does no service to either.</P>
      <P>Overall I welcome the Bill, which is very worthwhile. The provision of health care services is very dear to all in the House. The regulation of health care services is a natural consequence of their provision. Anything that improves the provision and regulation of health care is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this quite important legislation. At the outset I wish to declare a possible interest in that I am a counsellor. I am not sure how I would fit into the required qualifications for a psychologist, who according to the Bill should have &ldquo;A recognised university degree or diploma obtained with first or second class honours in <Col N="1626" />which psychology was taken as a major subject and honours obtained in that subject&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The professions listed can have a major impact on the lives of ordinary people when they seek help. It is important that people should have confidence when seeking such help. I am very concerned that anybody can put his or her name on a plate and declare himself or herself a counsellor. We are talking about the areas of psychology, psychotherapy etc. Significant damage can be caused by going to a person who is not trained in the particular area. Often serious deep emotional issues can be brought to the surface. If the counsellor, psychotherapist or psychologist is not adequately trained to help, support and treat, considerable damage can be caused. I suggest that counselling be examined in this light.</P>
      <P>Some podiatrists have brought to my attention their concern that the professional title of podiatry is not recognised in the Bill. They argue that this has been an accepted international term for many years. They seek to protect the public by enshrining continual professional development in the wording of the Bill. Those who have been in contact with me maintain that the Bill as drafted would result in the unsatisfactory position whereby a podiatrist could fail to practise for nearly five years and return to work without any retraining or update, or could be registered year-after-year without having to demonstrate any commitment to continual professional development. That could be the case in other areas and the Minister should examine it. They maintain that it is unacceptable and at variance with the Government claim to be developing a quality health service.</P>
      <P>The professionals that wish to register are required to have a bachelor of science degree in podiatry. They maintain that it would be anomalous to maintain the title of chiropodist only. Both titles have been in use for over 20 years and this degree qualification succeeded the diploma since the early 1980s. They argued that the name of podiatry is not so well known in Ireland and this is because there is no school of podiatry in the country. Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan of the Labour Party already alluded to that. Those wishing to study podiatry do so at one of the universities in the UK. They put forward the argument that recent legislation in the UK has protected both titles and they claim that we risk losing Irish graduates in podiatry to the UK if the title of podiatry is not protected under Irish legislation.</P>
      <P>Is it possible that persons could be registered in two professions? They claim that this does not pose a problem if persons have recognised qualifications in both. However, there is a possibility of registering persons via transitional arrangements in one profession while they have qualifications and are registered in another profession, such as An Bord Altranais and so on. They also state that the legislation should be amended to give assurances on competence. It is essential to keep up with current practice and recent evidence in health care. They claim that continuing pro<Col N="1627" />fessional development is an essential element of clinical governance and should be enshrined in the Bill. They also state that continuing education is a quality issue and that the health strategy is undermined by the principles of quality and fairness.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Bill deals with complaints. My reading of it is that the council cannot act unless it receives a complaint. I stand to be corrected, but it seems to me that the section is complaint driven. Irish people are slow to make complaints. We do not want the hassle and we let the issue go. Where medicine and the health professions are concerned, Irish people are slower to make complaints because they are afraid. A friend of mine called me this morning. His wife is in hospital, an operation went wrong and she is now seriously ill. He is very concerned about the quality of care she is receiving, but he does not know where to go because there is no mechanism to make a complaint. I suggest to the Minister of State that we allow feedback in all our hospitals. If one is in a hotel, one is given an feedback form to determine whether service was satisfactory. If patients leaving our hospitals were to do something similar, that could be taken on board. This legislation should also include provisions to allow for feedback.</P>
      <P>It would also be useful if the Minister included some form of a whistleblower mechanism. If someone rings the council and makes an informal complaint, the council should send an inspector to the clinic involved. If it is not up to standard, the council could take action. Such a provision would be very useful and it should be in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Some of these professions find it difficult to source clinical placements. I praise the Government for bringing forward 75 badly needed new places for occupational therapy. However, many occupational therapists cannot find clinical placement. The Government needs to make it easier for them, so that they can get the experience they require.</P>
      <P>The objective of the council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the designated professions. I welcome the fact that each of the designated professions will be represented on the council, along with representatives of the public, voluntary and third level sectors as well as the general public. Given that the initial council will have 12 members from the professions and 12 members from the other sectors, there will be a healthy balance within the council. Will this balance be affected when additional professions come into the registration system? How long will members of the council hold office? Can members be re-appointed? If so, for how many terms?</P>
      <P>Part 7 makes it an offence to use the title of any registered practitioner unless entitled to do so. I welcome the protection for both the public and the registered professions. We possibly need <Col N="1628" />to go further. People put advertisements in the newspapers claiming to improve health by providing this or that therapy. We need to control that and it is related to what is happening in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We know of doctors who claim to be able to cure cancer. I know people whose children had cancer and who visited these doctors, who paid out huge sums of money, who got medication and physically suffered in getting this medication. At the end of it all, the child died. This has happened more than once. The State needs to step in and take hold of this situation. People at their most vulnerable will grasp at any straw. It is dreadful that people will raise the hopes of parents of children who are terminally ill and take advantage of their vulnerability knowing that it is pure quackery. The State has a duty to ensure that this does not happen in any of the professions. This Bill provides a statutory basis for protecting members of the public who may be very vulnerable against exploitation.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister has retained the power to extend and add to the list of occupations in the Bill, which is welcome. I hope over time occupations which are not mentioned will be included. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage when amendments are being discussed for Members to make suggestions to include other professions.</P>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill. The wider issues involving complaints, especially in the context of hospitals, must be taken on board by the Government. It would help if a feedback mechanism were made available as people have nowhere to go at the moment. While I do not wish to cast aspersions on doctors and nurses who, in the main, work extremely hard under a great deal of pressure, if something goes wrong or a patient is dissatisfied, it would be useful for hospital management to have access to feedback to enable them to put matters right. A mechanism to address the gap would be an innovation for the Minister of State to take on board to make a name for himself. He is well known, of course, as it is.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill and wish the Minister good luck with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on a Bill that is about setting clear standards for various professionals and ensuring that the description of a service relates in some measure to its quality. That is a theme I wish to develop following a point raised by Deputy Stanton on qualified professionals in the health service. It is vital to ensure that they are not only qualified but experienced enough when functioning in an emergency to provide the counselling or advice required by a vulnerable person or group of people. Professionals must be able to ensure that the way in which they handle a subject is the best possible. I am sure every Member can cite instances in which that has not happened, which is not a criticism of any profession but of <Col N="1629" />the way in which professions have been integrated in the mainstream and of the in-service training they receive.</P>
      <P>The list of designated professions, which I note is not yet complete, should be much more extensive than currently drafted. I do not know why the opportunity has not been taken to take that course of action. To take up another point raised by Deputy Stanton, we have all heard of a particular case involving a person practising alternative medicine. While I am not opposed to alternative medicine, which has a great deal of merit and needs to be supported, certain standards should prevail. That the integrity of the entire practice can be severely damaged by one or two cases in which the highest standards have not been applied became extremely obvious in the instance of a particular case which came to public notice. Deputy Stanton was correct to note that when a vulnerable person believes he or she has a serious illness and is informed that a person or group is capable of alleviating the problem and restoring the patient to full health, he or she will tend to pay again and again for a service.</P>
      <P>It is of considerable importance, therefore, to provide for some degree of transparency and accountability in such circumstances. No consumer or patient should be left open to exploitation by any group, professional or otherwise, but the degree to which the Department can impose standards remains to be seen. It is obviously not happening to the extent that it should. I have great respect for those who practice alternative medicine having been a beneficiary of their activities from time to time. I would not be able to walk around as I do without the services of chiropractors. While many people have a deep suspicion of all alternative medicine practitioners, there are those who have a knowledge of anatomy, especially spinologists, which others do not specialise in. It is, therefore, important to ensure high standards and a quality end service. As with every profession, there will be some practitioners who are not as good as others and who are not perfectionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that too. To protect those who excel, every relevant profession should be included. Even if a profession is self-regulating, the relevant body will make some attempt to ensure the highest standards prevail as to do so is in their own interests. Alternative medicine practitioners offer good services that stand up to scrutiny, which is why cases such as the one referred to by Deputy Stanton require urgent action. The case in question should have been addressed before now. It should not be the case that the Minister or I can establish an alternative practice with as much credibility as certain people are currently doing.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for speech therapists and other practitioners from among the designated professions. Anyone who deals with the boards <Col N="1630" />of management of schools will readily attest to the shortage of speech therapists, special needs providers and psychologists, all of whose services are in great demand. While we do not have enough of them, we must ensure that those we have are good at their jobs. My experience with those with whom I have dealt is that they are good at their jobs and that they make a difference. More are needed given the requirement to a greater extent than used to be the case for their services. While statistics are available which inform various theories, I do not know the underlying reason for the increased demand for services. These circumstances, however, require a response which meets the demands of quantity and quality. It is right, therefore, that the provisions of the Bill incorporate the professions providing services in this area.</P>
      <P>Self-regulation is important to enable professionals to take responsibility for the actions of all members of their professions. Collective as well as individual responsibility tends to improve service quality. There must also, however, be an overarching regulator as a self-regulating body should not constitute the only supervisory authority for a profession. I presume the legislation will make provision in this respect as every regulatory authority needs a certain amount of supervision from time to time. All State institutions should set an example.</P>
      <P>When I was a member of a health board I always tried to apply the same standards to the health board institutions that the health board purported to apply to others. Things have changed and I am afraid it does not always happen that way. I do not know what is the cause of that. I have a general idea that for some unknown reason as we progress further into the Celtic tiger infested forest, people no longer care and do not wish to take individual responsibility.</P>
      <P>People no longer have the vocational commitment that existed 25 or 30 years ago. This can be measured by talking to older professionals in any profession, including those who come within the compass of the Bill. If one compares the degree of vocational commitment that existed when those people trained and got their first jobs, and the level of commitment evident today, there is a vast difference. It even relates to the professionals in this House. We must recognise that this is a fact of life.</P>
      <P>There is a colossal difference, for example, in the degree to which volunteering takes place now compared with 25 or 30 years ago. Voluntary commitment in any area or profession is vastly different from what it was. The older professionals operated above and beyond the call of duty. I have reasons for citing that commitment which I do not particularly want to go into in this House. Many people protest when this matter is raised but it is a fact and we are all culpable when we examine the extent to which we are required to make sacrifices in the course of our jobs.</P>
      <P>Let us look at how the standards apply. It is important that each profession applies the highest <Col N="1631" />possible standards. It follows that in the field of operation one professional will observe another and the degree to which the standards to which they all aspire are applied. If there is a weakness in any area, far from that weakness becoming the subject of a whistleblower, it will become the norm. The lowest common denominator becomes the standard.</P>
      <P>I regret a development that sadly applies to the health area in particular, which is not a criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. If a Member of this House asks a question about any aspect of the health service, it is to protect the Minister as much as to protect the members of the Opposition and the public, and if the answer is not forthcoming, there must be a reason. There are no circumstances in which the information sought should not be made available to the House. It makes no difference whether the Minister has direct responsibility for the matter, the Minister will ultimately be held responsible if a major scandal arises under the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, as was borne out in a recent speech made by a former civil servant. He correctly identified that the Minister is responsible, directly and indirectly, for everything that happens within his or her Department even though he or she may not have known what was happening.</P>
      <P>I emphasise this issue because scarcely a day goes by without some circumstance coming to light where somebody is wronged and their rights are infringed upon because somebody somewhere would not answer a question or raise his or her voice. The media invariably blame the person who did nothing about it. The only people who can do something about this are the Members of this House and members of other parliaments throughout the world. If the answers are not forthcoming, it ultimately reflects on the person who did not provide the answer for one reason or other.</P>
      <P>It has always been my view that there is a need for Ministers on taking office to call their senior civil servants together and explain to them that everything that happens within the ambit of the Department should be made known to the Minister forthwith, and that regular evaluations to this effect would be carried out and communicated to the Minister. That would protect Ministers, Governments and those in Opposition. More importantly, it would protect the public. If that approach is not taken, problems will arise.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will agree with that principle. I have a different reason for saying it, not because I am in Opposition, but because I believe it protects people in Government as well as those in Opposition. When criticism is made and there are valid grounds for it, the public blames the institutions as a whole. They do not distinguish between them. It may be good for those who are in Government when the odium is equally applied to everybody and it may be good for the Oppo<Col N="1632" />sition to say that the Government is to blame, however, ultimately it reflects on all of us if matters are not handled in the best possible manner.</P>
      <P>Why has this ethos begun to develop? I believe we live in a time in which nobody ultimately wants to take responsibility, when everybody wants to shirk his or her responsibilities. People want to give good news when there is good news but to run like hell when there is anything else to be said. That is a sign of the times, and it goes hand in hand with the lack of vocational commitment to which I referred. I foresee great difficulties arising in future unless something is done about this because it does not matter who is in Government or who is Taoiseach or Minister, ultimately, events will catch up with them as something will happen along the line that will emerge three, four or ten years later and when it does, it will reflect on all of us in this House.</P>
      <P>Something was said to me recently in a different context about how to make the democratic process more efficient. I had to remind those concerned that democracy is not about efficiency, it is about transparency, accountability, the right of the people to elect those who represent them and the right of the public to ensure that those whom they elect to high office are ultimately accountable to them. One cannot do that on the cheap. It has to be done in the hard, old fashioned way. Alternatives to this have been tried in many countries. They were tried for 50 years in eastern European countries and they failed.</P>
      <P>I wandered a bit from the area where I started &mdash; professionals &mdash; but my remarks relate to professional accountability and responsibility.</P>

      <P>When I was a Minister of State, as Deputy Brian Lenihan is now, an official in the Department came to me one morning in a terrible panic because somebody had tabled a parliamentary question which he believed could be very embarrassing. I looked at the question and did not consider it embarrassing. I had no difficulty answering that question. It was answered and was therefore done and dusted. There are those who believe a question is done and dusted if one does not answer it. It is not and that is the difference.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to a number of professionals, some of whom are included, some of whom are not and others of whom do not need to be included. They all have a responsibility to main<Col N="1633" />tain a high standard of service and integrity within their respective professions. They have done great work in times gone by and some, but not all, still do so. Unfortunately, those who dally and do not aspire to the highest standards result in everyone being branded as the same, as is the case in politics. This is the sad part but it is the way it is.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy Glennon who was perplexed by the degree to which two professionals can argue over a particular title. It should be possible for mature professionals to work out a solution that accommodates both their professions, unless the services they offer are identical, in which case there should be a means of differentiating between the two.</P>
      <P>I support the principle in the Bill of introducing a list of professions, standards and what I hope will amount to accountability and transparency. I hope that as a result of the passage of the legislation, attention will be paid to a number of other areas that have been referred to in the course of the debate and which now urgently need attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan">
      <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies on all sides for the broad welcome they have extended for this measure. I agree with Deputy Durkan that while we can put legislation in place to ensure a high standard in a given profession or occupation, the basic motivation and spirit must exist among members of that profession to observe the highest standards. His point was well made in that regard, especially in respect of the need for one to take responsibility for one&rsquo;s actions. It is often forgotten that the health and child care services often include many of the social services as well as the physical and mental health services. A vast number of employees are encompassed and no political head of a Department or public servant charged with administration on the permanent side in the Department can hope to implement policy without the wholehearted co-operation and taking of responsibility by everyone within the system.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised the introduction of statutory registration for health professions over and above the 12 apostles outlined in the Bill. It is important to note that these 12 professions were selected because they are long-established providers of health and social care within the health service and, in most instances, have established experience of self-regulation. The qualifications of the majority of these professions are regulated within the public health service.</P>
      <P>Environmental health officers were involved in consultations with the Department on the development of the proposals for statutory registration. They were to be covered by the system but, following discussion with the relevant union and professional body, the view was taken that as the majority of the work of environmental health officers involves monitoring compliance with legislation on food safety and environmental <Col N="1634" />matters, the participation of their profession is not appropriate to this legislation at this point. However, there is a provision in the Bill whereby environmental health officers or other professionals can be brought into the statutory registration system. Deputies will find this provision in section 4.</P>
      <P>The regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists in particular was raised by Deputies. I fully appreciate their concerns in this matter and am very aware that the provision of counselling and psychotherapy services to the public has increased over recent years. The former health board chief executive officer group had established a working group to examine the role of psychotherapy in the health service to assess the requirement for the future. The working group&rsquo;s report has been finalised and the next step will be for an action plan to be put in place for making progress on the issues, including issues regarding the development of an appropriate model of service. The outcome of this work will form an integral part of the formal process that would be required, as set out in the Bill, to determine whether statutory registration is warranted. An integral part of the legislation is that it will always enable the designation of further professions.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the Bill for its contribution to enhanced regulation of conventional health care professions, Deputies also spoke of the need for better regulation of complementary therapists. These practitioners do not come under the provisions of the Bill. I agree that the regulation of these therapists is especially important bearing in mind the increasing number of people who have recourse to such practitioners. I agree with Deputy Durkan that recourse to these practitioners can have beneficial results. That said, the often informal nature of how some complementary therapies are practised requires more scrutiny. Greater controls in the complementary therapy area are also in the interest of all reputable practising therapists as the presence of some unscrupulous practitioners undermines the sector as well as presenting risks to those using the therapies.</P>
      <P>A national working group on the regulation of complementary therapists was established in May 2003. It has met regularly and was expected to report by the end of this year. In light of the urgency attached to this matter, the T&aacute;naiste asked that the work of the group be expedited. I understand the report will be finalised within the next few months. The approach to putting in place the most appropriate framework to regulate the activities of complementary therapists will be informed by the group&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
      <P>The issue of protection of title was raised by a number of Deputies. The position is that one title is protected for each profession under the legislation, with a provision that variants can be protected by regulation under section 95(3). This is in line with the legal advice available to the Department. It will clearly be an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a protected title <Col N="1635" />or to represent himself or herself falsely as being a registered practitioner.</P>
      <P>There has been a debate within the chiropody-podiatry profession on the most appropriate title for that profession within the primary legislation. I am well aware of this debate. The title &ldquo;chiropodist&rdquo; is used in the Bill because it reflects the current more common title by which the profession is known to the public. However, the profession is having discussions on its title and varying views are entertained by groups within the profession on the most appropriate title to be used in the primary legislation. Some groups have expressed a preference for the title &ldquo;podiatrist&rdquo;. The professional bodies representing chiropodists and podiatrists have not yet been able to reach a unanimous decision on which title to protect under the primary legislation. The Department&rsquo;s position has been to encourage all stakeholders involved to develop an agreed solution to the issue of the protection of title and I hope the matter can be resolved.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the protection of the title &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; for use by those professionals registered with the physiotherapists registration board. As Deputies are aware, the Irish Chartered Society of Physiotherapists is also seeking the protection of &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; for use by those professionals registered with the physiotherapists registration board. Several Deputies referred to this in the debate. The society considers both titles to be interchangeable in an international context and believes there is a risk of confusing the public if the title of &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; were not protected for use by physiotherapists. However, members of the Irish Association of Physical Therapists, who train with the Institute of Physical Therapy and who use the title in this country want to retain the title. There are complex legal, competition related and public interest issues involved in resolving this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department has met the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and the Irish Association of Physical Therapists before and since the publication of the Bill with a view to encouraging both organisations to develop an agreed solution to the issue of the protection of title that takes account of the issues involved. I salute the great work of the officers in the Department who endeavour to conduct a number of peace processes in regard to these titles.</P>
      <P>The question of registration of practitioners who do not hold national qualifications was raised during the debate. The Bill provides for the assessment of qualifications obtained within or outside the European Union. This matter will, however, be kept under review as the Bill progresses to ensure that it deals comprehensively with the issue.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the composition of the health and social care professionals council and registration boards. The membership provisions are designed to ensure the best balance of professional expertise, health sector knowledge <Col N="1636" />and public interest. There will be consultation on these appointments.</P>
      <P>The effect of the inclusion of additional professions in the system on the number of council members is provided for in the Bill. It will therefore deal with an increase in the number of professionals, or any additional professions recognised.</P>
      <P>The role of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was mentioned in the context of the appointment of members to the council and boards. Several Deputies tried to see very far-reaching implications in that proposal. According to the old adage, all professions are in conspiracy against the public. The Minister took the view that it was not enough for the Minister for Health and Children to regulate the professions and that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should also have a role in the matter. This is in the public interest, because the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must protect the public interest with regard to matters of competition. Professions often become anti-competitive and succeed in persuading the Department that it is supposed to regulate them in an anti-competitive manner. Therefore it is desirable, in a measure such as this, to have provision for the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Bill provides that members who are representative of the public interest be appointed by the Minister for Health and Children with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions in regard to the constitution of the council, registration boards and disciplinary committees will facilitate openness and transparency and ensure that the right talents and experience are put at our disposal with regard to the regulation of these professions.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed about the need for consistency among the registration boards. The health and social care professionals council will have a co-ordinating role ensuring uniformity of procedures throughout the system. The chief executive officer of the council will act as registrar for the registration boards.</P>
      <P>Deputies showed considerable interest in the provisions for dealing with complaints about persons on the register and expressed concern that health professionals might feel fearful of suffering adverse consequences in bringing a complaint against a colleague. The provisions of the Bill facilitate a fair, just and open process for bringing and dealing with complaints. I appreciate the concern that peer pressure may hinder a practitioner from making complaints. However, practitioners are aware of the need to act in the immediate interest of patients to protect patient safety and in the wider interest of their profession to ensure that it is not brought into disrepute by the behaviour or incompetence of a minority.</P>
      <P>Deputies also referred to the provisions of section 61, which facilitate a situation where a registrant accepts admonishment or censure from a committee of inquiry following a complaint. A <Col N="1637" />committee of inquiry has particular powers under the proposed legislation and the health and social care professional council can apply to the High Court for an order directing a registration board to suspend the registration of a registrant against whom a complaint has been made if the council considers that the suspension is necessary to protect the public until further steps are taken with regard to the complaint.</P>
      <P>The role of the representative bodies was also raised. Each of the professions designated under the Bill already has one major professional body, the role of which has been significant in the past and will remain so.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the importance of the work of the national social work qualifications board. The continuity of the work and contribution of the NSWQB to professional development, education and training of the social work profession will be maintained and built upon in the legislation. Deputies mentioned university courses for chiropodists and podiatrists and the Department is examining the education of the profession with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>With regard to a lack of student places and staff shortages, there have been significant advances in recent years in terms of increasing the number of students coming into the professions covered in the Bill. There has been a very clear increase in the numbers employed in the public health service. The medical profession is the subject of different legislation which is promised and will deal with some of the issues raised by the Deputies about medical practitioners engaging in complementary therapies. The registration boards will be empowered to make by-laws that can encompass continuing professional development.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the attention and care they have given this legislation. If improvement is required on Committee Stage, the T&aacute;naiste and I will be open to any reasonable suggestion.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long-awaited Bill. The Minister for Agriculture and Food brought forward this legislation to improve efficiency in <Col N="1638" />the remaining operations of the former Land Commission and to fulfil a Government commitment in the Sustaining Progress agreement.</P>
      <P>Under that agreement, the Government undertook to significantly reduce the burden of land purchase annuities on farmers. This Bill goes beyond that commitment by removing altogether the burden of annuities for more than 4,500 annuitants, some two thirds of all annuities payable at present. In addition, the Bill provides for the introduction of a generous buy-out scheme, reducing the redemption price by 25% for the remaining annuity if payments are up to date. The Bill also contains a number of control measures to ensure that the State is not exposed to financial loss in the event that annuitants fail to pay their annuities.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Bill is successful and attracts the maximum number of farmers to participate. It is in the interest of the Government to ensure that the system of collection of land purchase annuities is resolved once and for all. I urge farming organisations to encourage their members to take up this offer. Once the Land Bill 2004 becomes law, those who do not take part in the buy-out offer will have to continue meeting their commitments as they have heretofore. One important difference is that the Department will have additional powers of recovery of arrears, such as seeking the off-setting of single payments due and garnishee orders. This will only become an issue following substantial consultation with the annuitant and after all attempts at genuine, voluntary payments have failed.</P>
      <P>These are financial obligations and should be recognised as such by all annuitants. Valuable land was allocated to farmers and they must, in return, honour these debts. This reality is equivalent to the standard property mortgage most of us must pay. The Department has never charged interest on any of the outstanding arrears accumulated that have saved annuitants substantial amounts of money. All farmers have had the opportunity to avail of the 1993 scheme, but failed to do so. This Bill will effectively write off 4,500 annuities of less than &euro;200 per acre, both capital and arrears, at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;3.9 million. If all remaining annuitants take up this second generous buy-out, the cost of the 25% discount to the Exchequer will be a further &euro;4.7 million. I trust and hope the scheme being introduced will be successful.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill for its measures of simplifying the transfer of land held as trust set up by the Irish Land Commission. The Land Bill introduces significantly easier means for trustees of these properties to transfer the land to those who use it. There are 350 remaining property trusts, of which approximately 200 are used by local clubs for sports and games under the auspices of the GAA. Clear title to these properties will allow clubs and community organisations to develop the lands for community, recreation or sporting purposes. This measure, in particular, pleases me because I know the importance of local GAA and other sporting <Col N="1639" />clubs to the community and their influence in encouraging young boys and girls to be part of that community.</P>
      <P>It is vital that such clubs are free to develop and grow with their communities. I am aware that many clubs are fearful of investing in long-term developments because of the uncertainty regarding the ownership of their grounds. This measure will assist the transfer of such properties into the hands of those who use the grounds. It will allow GAA clubs and other such organisations to take ownership of their grounds and remove their fears regarding the long-term ownership of the lands. The removal of any doubt about the future use of the land will encourage club development committees to pursue longer term aims and developments and will underpin the position of the clubs within the communities that they serve. Anything that allows clubs to grow and develop and enhances the community is worthy of strong support. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work carried out by the dedicated trustees of these properties under whose stewardship the trusts have grown.</P>
      <P>The transfer of cow parks no longer needed for their original purpose back to local communities is also very welcome. There is a very good example of this in my constituency where Athboy cow park is being developed for community use. In County Meath there are more trust properties than in any other county and this has been particularly beneficial to the GAA. At a time when many cow parks are being handed back, in particular to county councils, it must be acknowledged that some of them are not suitable for development for sporting activities. The Minister of State, Deputy Smith, knows my part of County Meath very well and he knows there is a large number of cow parks in the Oldcastle, Kells, Carlinstown, Nobber, Athboy, Rathmore and Bohermeen areas. Some of them are suitable to be given back to county councils and many have already been given back. Where they can be used for the local communities, I accept that and am delighted to see it happen.</P>
      <P>However, I have some concerns. Those of us who have served on county councils know from experience what might happen to these lands. If money is needed in some other area, I do not want to see a situation where county councils sell these parks on the open market to developers or big farmers. These cow parks were made available long before my time and as a child I remember when the local people had their cow and calf in these cow parks, to supply milk and butter for the family. I would not like to see the big tycoons of County Meath or any other county, acquiring these lands at the expense of the type of people they were provided for many years ago.</P>
      <P>With the new guidelines introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, I envisage the lands being made available in rural areas as sites for young couples at a reduced rate. I ask the <Col N="1640" />Minister of State to consider that option. There are people who have emigrated whose fathers or grandfathers may have owned some of these plots in County Meath. Many of their ancestors originally came from the west and they were very welcome and they played a major role in our county. They also came from County Kerry, Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s county, and people like Colm O&rsquo;Rourke came from Leitrim. Some great people migrated through the Land Commission. We have some great people from the Minister of State&rsquo;s area who came to my area of County Meath, around Kilskeer, Crossakeel and Ballinlough. I would like to see their sons or daughters, who had to emigrate to America, England, Australia and Canada &mdash; in my youth, to go to Dublin was similar to emigrating &mdash; come back. If those people want to come back to County Meath and acquire a site under the new guidelines, it should be made available to them. However, I am anxious that a specific clause be inserted in the legislation relating to these cow plots that stipulates they cannot be sold on the open market. I plead with the Minister of State in this regard and I know, given where he comes from, he would have concern for such people. He must make sure the big tycoons cannot buy these lands because I would not like to see that happening.</P>
      <P>We all know the paper mountain is one of the great challenges facing modern farming. I welcome the single payment system as it reduces the level of paperwork and I am delighted to see the Minister continuing to reduce the paperwork that farmers must complete. I particularly welcome the removal of section 12, which required the approval of the land commission and more recently, the Department, before subdivision of holdings could take place. For many farm families, giving a site to a family member who is not going the inherit the farm is considered the fairest family settlement. Currently, any such subdivision of more than one hectare requires the approval of the Department. While the original intention of this provision was to prevent fragmentation of farms, economics has now driven farming in such a direction that the provision of small sites for a house does not compromise the holding itself. Indeed, many young people in rural communities would find it very difficult to establish a family home without the aid of a site from their parents. Rural communities would be deprived of many young, talented people if such family arrangements were not established practice and many elderly farmers would not have family support and assistance in their old age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>On Tuesday, 14 June 2005, the NAMHI parent representatives walked out of the consultative group meeting of the HSE southern region, which was held at Blackpool in Cork. There were several reasons for this protest but the catalyst was the presentation of the 2005 funding allocation to the HSE southern region for additional places in the intellectual disability sector. In spite of Government promises the allocation for additional residential respite and day care places is woefully inadequate to deal with the planned requirements as specified in the national intellectual disability database figures which are submitted to central Government. An example of the shortfall in County Kerry is the need for &euro;4.4 million in 2005 between the three adult service providers and the fact that only &euro;771,000 was allocated, a shortfall of almost &euro;2.7 million.</P>
        <P>According to the national intellectual disability database figures on the adult services in Cork and Kerry, 209 additional residential places are needed in 2005 and 38 places have been funded. An additional 334 respite places are needed and 15 places have been funded. The situation is totally unacceptable. For the past 12 months the NAMHI parent representatives have found it increasingly difficult to carry out their function to represent the parents of children and adults with an intellectual disability in the Cork and Kerry region. They were asked to make recommendations to the new HSE structures on the services required for the new five-year plan 2005-09. They spent considerable time and effort in doing so and in discussions at the various consultative group meetings.</P>
        <P>They put forward the concerns, frustrations and anger of parents and suggested different and innovative ways of sourcing funding and providing for vital services. They found it difficult to obtain necessary information and statistics and have been very frustrated at the number of times they have had to ask the same questions at subsequent meetings without adequate response. The lack of clarity due to the changeover from the Southern Health Board to the HSE southern region has not helped matters.</P>
        <P>The parents asked for a meeting with the regional planning committee to express their concerns but to date that committee has not agreed to meet them. The funding allocation presented to the parents on 14 June highlighted the total waste of their time in producing recommendations for service provisions. From the information available to the parents, the moneys requested by the agencies were first reduced by a value for money cut and then no consideration was given to the need for additional places as identified in the database.</P>
        <Col N="1642" />
        <P>The service development needs in the Kerry area for the 2005-09 period are generally as follows. Residential places for six people must be prioritised for immediate full-time residential care. Kerry parents and friends association proposes to establish a dedicated respite house as a priority. Demand for respite is increasing daily. St. John of God in Tralee has notified that it cannot take any more respite people for the foreseeable future. It is no longer acceptable nor practicable to provide respite for strangers in community houses that are often the full-time homes of many service users.</P>
        <P>The need for day places for school leavers in 2005 should be provided in local community settings. The referral process for school leavers needs to be formalised with at least a two-year lead in. A consultant psychiatrist specialising in intellectual disability is required to be based in Kerry. Speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists are urgently required in both children&rsquo;s and adult services in Kerry. The relocation of people with intellectual disabilities who were inappropriately placed in St. Finian&rsquo;s Hospital, Killarney, is long overdue. Kerry parents and friends association has an urgent requirement for a special residential facility staffed by specialists in challenging behaviours, to cater long and short term for a small number of service users who present with challenging behaviours. Such behaviour cannot be addressed in community residences and is very disruptive to other residents.</P>
        <P>It is very important that the parents&rsquo; representatives, given the urgency with which they view their circumstances, feel that energy and resources available to them should be spent in trying to unravel the emerging role of the HSE and the difficulties this brings as well as seeing where best to place their legitimate protest. They want an immediate meeting with the HSE southern planning committee to voice their concerns and to seek to agree an agenda in which the parents can approach the various HSE structures nationally and the various Departments charged with providing adequate service.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter, which I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, with a view to an early meeting on the matter. It provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the additional funding provided for services for children and adults with disabilities in 2005.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, the Government announced that disability and mental health services would be prioritised under the Estimates for new health initiatives in 2005. An additional sum of &euro;40 million was to be allocated in 2005 to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism. This would form part of a five-year multi-annual budget for the sector. The <Col N="1643" />new funding would provide additional residential, respite and day places, improve specialist support services and meet costs associated with moving individuals to more appropriate placements.</P>
        <P>In April 2005 a meeting took place between officials from the HSE southern area and NAMHI at which matters relating to intellectual disability services in the southern area, including service deficits in the Kerry area, were discussed.</P>
        <P>In June 2005 the HSE southern area received notification of its allocation of over &euro;6 million out of &euro;40 million allocated to intellectual disability and autism services in 2005. Through a process of consultation with all service providers, parents and clients, funding was allocated in accordance with local priorities, in consultation with the regional planning committee for intellectual disability services.</P>
        <P>At the consultative group meeting on 14 June which involved parents, nominees of service providers and HSE officials, the allocation of funding for 2005 was discussed but NAMHI left the meeting prior to discussion.</P>
        <P>NAMHI has requested a meeting with the regional planning committee and this request will be brought to the next committee meeting which takes place in early autumn.</P>

        <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Finian McGrath.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.</P>
        <P>Christy McGrath is a 28 year old jockey serving a 16-year sentence for murder at Gartree Prison in Leicestershire. This is the stark fact which bears repetition. In the not too distant past when I used to look on political proceedings from the spectator&rsquo;s point of view, I always had a great regard for and took an interest in the activities of politicians who became involved in issues of miscarriage of justice, particularly in the UK. The names of Annie Maguire, the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six are etched in the minds of people in Ireland who are politically motivated. I take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the eventual delivery of justice for all concerned.</P>
        <P>I believe that Christy McGrath is another name to be added to that unfortunate list. I am not saying categorically that there has been a miscarriage of justice, I do not believe anyone can say that without hearing all the evidence in a courtroom setting, but having read the papers and spoken to people interested in the case, I believe there are ample grounds for considerable doubt about the guilty decision made against Christy McGrath. I urge the Minister, everybody involved and everybody with a possible input to ensure that every effort is made at all levels to have a review of the case at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>We hear much about the special relationship between this nation and our neighbour but I do <Col N="1644" />not know that we have such a relationship. It is cases like this one that will test whether we have one. I have no doubt that we have a unique relationship. We are unique in terms of our proximity &mdash; we are the closest neighbour either has &mdash; the entirety of northern part of this island and the fact that we share a language and are on the edge of Europe. Whether that relationship is healthy or special, it is cases like Christy McGrath&rsquo;s that will test its quality.</P>
        <P>If a person from another jurisdiction sought preferential treatment in our justice system, we would probably be quite negative about granting it. However, in light of the unique relationship between the islands, particularly the unprecedented level of political interaction that has taken place for some time, we should prove the healthy state of our relationship and expedite the processes involved in dealing with Christy McGrath&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not only not to sympathise with Christy McGrath but his parents and family but also not to congratulate them on the manner in which they have dealt with the predicament that has been visited upon them. I also pay tribute to the 50 parliamentarians in Westminster and, as of today, a similar number in these Houses who are taking up the cudgels to ensure that justice will eventually be delivered to Christy McGrath at, I hope, the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

        <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment matter. I strongly support what Deputy Glennon said. It is refreshing to see a former international rugby star support another sportsman, Christy McGrath. I am delighted to announce that up to 40 Deputies and Senators have indicated their support for this campaign and 50 MPs support the campaign to have Christy&rsquo;s case reopened. I commend Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and my Independent colleague, Deputy Healy, for their work on this case.</P>
        <P>Christy McGrath, a young jump jockey from Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of ex-football player, Gary Walton, in a Durham village in July 2000. Christy has denied repeatedly that he was responsible for Walton&rsquo;s death. He is seeking immediate appeal against this unjust conviction. On leaving a County Durham pub Christy McGrath was accosted, racially abused and assaulted by Gary Walton. Attempting to regain entrance to the pub, Christy was again attacked by Walton with a brick and was forced to defend himself. Walton was alive when Christy left the scene. Other men, two wearing balaclavas, are known to have approached Walton on the night after Christy left. One returned to the scene more than once. The body was found by police the following morning. Walton died of strangulation. He was strangled with such force that his neck and vertebrae were broken. Walton was over 6 ft tall <Col N="1645" />and heavily built, Christy is more slightly built and a shorter man.</P>
        <P>Throughout the course of their investigations, the police referred to Christy as &ldquo;the Irish lad&rdquo;. He had no motive to kill Gary Walton. Christy tried to avoid the fight by running back to the pub. Witnesses in Christy&rsquo;s favour were never heard. One admitted washing blood-stained clothes while another stated seeing a murder by men in balaclavas. Police claimed they were unable to state the time of Gary Walton&rsquo;s death. Christy only learnt that the victim had died of strangulation after he pleaded guilty in court.</P>
        <P>Christy McGrath&rsquo;s family and supporters are calling for the immediate referral of this case to the Court of Appeal. The investigation into the killing of Gary Walton should be reopened as a matter of urgency. The day before his trial for murder, Christy&rsquo;s lawyer put pressure on him to change his plea to guilty. He was told that if he did not, he would serve between 25 and 30 years in prison.</P>
        <P>I urge people to support this campaign. It is a genuine one. I hope this will not be another miscarriage of justice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to reply to the issue raised by Deputies Glennon and Finian McGrath on the case of Mr. Christy McGrath. I am mindful of Deputy Glennon&rsquo;s comments about the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, two cases which I reported on as a journalist in London. I am very conscious of the issues and the heart-rending matters involved for the families of those concerned. I am also very conscious of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s contribution to this campaign. We are anxious to respond as best we can.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has been actively monitoring the case of Christy McGrath from Carrick-on-Suir who was charged with the murder of an ex-footballer outside a pub in Coundon, County Durham, England, in July 2000. At his trial in January 2001, Mr. McGrath pleaded guilty to the murder and was given the mandatory sentence of life. He is required to serve a minimum period of 14 years before he can be considered for release. Since his trial Mr. McGrath has claimed that he was pressured by his legal team on the day of his trial to change his earlier plea of &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; to one of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; and that he was informed that if he did not do so, he would receive 30 years without parole.</P>
        <P>Mr. McGrath has been visited on six separate occasions by a diplomatic officer of the Irish Embassy in London. Mr. McGrath claims that forensic evidence exists which, if examined, would exonerate him and he remains adamant that if he got a retrial, he would be found innocent. He has reiterated his contention that he was set up by others, including his co-accused who walked free, and that he was bullied by his legal team into pleading guilty on the morning of his trial.</P>
        <P>Mr. McGrath has engaged a well known firm of UK lawyers to advance his legal case and he <Col N="1646" />hopes that it will be possible for an appeal to be lodged. I understand that his solicitor has indicated that she continues to seek grounds on which to lodge an appeal and-or to seek to have the case reopened. As the House will appreciate, Mr. McGrath&rsquo;s legal representative is best placed to advise him on the options open to him to avail of appeal procedures in the British judicial system.</P>
        <P>In October 2001, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, met Mr. McGrath&rsquo;s family and supporters and assured them that the Department would continue to provide all appropriate consular assistance to Mr. McGrath and his family. The Department, through the Irish Embassy in London, continues to monitor the case closely and remains in contact with Mr. McGrath. A diplomatic officer from the embassy has visited him on six occasions. The most recent visit was on 23 June 2005. On 26 April 2005 the embassy also met representatives of the group campaigning for his release.</P>
        <P>The embassy has also remained in contact with the prison authorities on Mr. McGrath&rsquo;s behalf. He was initially detained in Holme House Prison in Stockton in England and, during his first consular prison visit, he asked for the embassy&rsquo;s help in securing his transfer to the prison in Gartree as he felt it would more easily facilitate visits from his solicitor and family. He also indicated that he wished to be transferred as Holme House was near Durham where the murder occurred and he was concerned for his own safety and that of his family if he remained in prison in that area. Following representations from the embassy he was transferred to Gartree prison in June 2002.</P>
        <P>Up to recently Mr. McGrath was working in the prison. He is now, however, recovering from surgery to his feet. He informed the embassy on the last visit that he has no complaints against the prison authorities.</P>
        <P>So far, Mr. McGrath has declined to apply for a transfer under the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to serve out his sentence in a prison in Ireland. He remains determined not to do so until his innocence is recognised. Neither has he participated in any prison offenders&rsquo; courses for the exact same reason.</P>
        <P>There is an independent body in Britain, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which has the power to review and supervise investigations into possible miscarriages of justice. It is my understanding, however, that unless there are exceptional circumstances, the commission is not empowered to consider cases unless the normal court appeal system has been exhausted.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Irish Embassy, will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to Mr. McGrath.</P>

      <sTitle>Postal Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
        <P>In recent weeks I have received reports from throughout the country of people who have been experiencing the non-delivery of <Col N="1647" />mail for days and sometimes weeks on end. This lack of a proper postal service has been particularly bad in my constituency of Dublin North-East and in neighbouring constituencies in the estates of the Donahies and Clare Hall in particular. I have also received similar reports from throughout the country, including from Clare and Limerick. In one instance in my area, some residents were left without a postal delivery for more than a week and when they queried this, they were told to go down to the local sorting office and collect the post themselves. Another person was awaiting a P60 which was subsequently mislaid and this individual was also told to go to the local sorting office and retrieve the document.</P>
        <P>On contacting An Post senior management about this unsatisfactory situation, I was told the reason for such lapses in mail delivery is that postal workers who are legitimately absent from work due to illness or annual holidays are not being replaced while out of work and in those instances post was simply not being delivered. I was also told that the long-standing embargo on the recruitment of temporary staff, which An Post has implemented over recent years, is continuing.</P>
        <P>This is an astonishing and unacceptable state of affairs. An Post is mandated with a universal postal service obligation that guarantees every home and premises in the State with at least one delivery every weekday. That its senior management has placed a moratorium on temporary and holiday staff is insufficient reason for not fulfilling the universal postal obligation.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue last week at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is a practice that An Post management cannot be allowed to continue. The universal postal service obligation is a cherished right of every citizen and must be discharged by the company. It is true that there have been difficult times in An Post, especially in 2002 and 2003. However, its annual report last year reported a profit of more than &euro;7 million. The sale of major UK subsidiaries has realised something in the region of &euro;85 million and there is also the projected sale of the SDS premises on the Naas Road. I understand that SDS is closing tomorrow, which is extremely regrettable and, I believe, unnecessary.</P>
        <P>Much of the turnaround of An Post&rsquo;s fortunes has been achieved by the sacrifices of its workforce which has not had a pay rise for the last two and a half years, unlike the Members and staff of the Oireachtas who received the increases due under Sustaining Progress. I am informed that a 5% increase is due this week, backdated from the beginning of this year, but this does not go anywhere towards relieving the real suffering of An Post workers. The most disgraceful aspect of all is the treatment of An Post pensioners. It is a continuing disgrace that the 8,000 former workers and their families who have given decades of service to the country have not received any increases over the past two and a half years. <Col N="1648" />Many of them, under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, are former civil servants. The Government is in an illegal position in not ensuring they receive it.</P>
        <P>It is a continuing disgrace that many postmasters throughout the country do not have a minimum wage nor do they receive support to computerise the 400 offices that need to be updated urgently. There is a range of issues which the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, must address with An Post management to try to get the national postal service back to the standard we knew and loved for many years and to try to bring about a positive workforce. Many of the ideas that need to be implemented are included in the excellent document, An Post: A New Vision, recently published by An Post&rsquo;s group of unions.</P>
        <P>There is need for a new direction for the company. It should be undertaken in partnership with staff and management and led by the Minister. It should not be one where all the sacrifices are made by the postal workers, past and present, and more recently by householders and businesses that do not have their universal postal service. The Minister should give a lead on this, urgently. It is a matter I have raised many times in the House this session. He should give a lead to ensure we return to the type of postal services we always enjoyed, with a happy workforce and group of pensioners and with strong support for the local post office network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey. I wish to be helpful by outlining the state of the postal sector at this time. The sector has changed significantly in recent years as the European postal market has been liberalised and postal operators have moved from national to international markets. The postal market in Ireland and, primarily, An Post faces challenges such as increased competition which arises from the liberalisation of the market as well as falling mail volumes and competition from electronic substitution. As it operates in a more competitive market, An Post will need to offer high-quality postal products and services to consumers who, increasingly, will be able to choose from a range of postal providers. We can expect such a postal market in future.</P>
        <P>As the full liberalisation of the sector by 2009 is a real possibility, An Post must prepare to ensure that it can continue to be a strong player in the Irish postal market. Already the parcels sector in Ireland is fully liberalised in line with the EU postal directive and this has led to major international players operating in the Irish market. An Post now holds only 25% of the parcels market in this country.</P>
        <P>The implementation of full liberalisation by 2009 will, if achieved, open up the letter post area to full competition. The Commission is undertaking further studies on the impact of competition on the universal service requirement which is enshrined in EU and Irish law. The requirement <Col N="1649" />means that all addresses, both business and private, are entitled to deliveries at uniform tariffs with a guaranteed frequency. No decision has been taken yet at EU level on the future nature of the universal service obligation if the market is fully liberalised in 2009.</P>
        <P>An Post is the designated universal service provider in Ireland and therefore the universal service obligation is a statutory requirement of the company. Furthermore, the European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations 2002 set out the area of the postal market solely reserved for An Post to allow the company to fulfil its universal service obligations. These exclusive rights for the delivery of certain services are deemed necessary to ensure the maintenance of the universal service.</P>
        <P>There is agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class countrywide delivery service to the customer into the future. To progress the change agenda, an exhaustive process of negotiations between An Post management and trade unions, with the assistance of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, has been ongoing for some time. An Post unions and management have been involved in intensive negotiations under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, in a bid to agree a recovery plan that will put the company on a sound footing.</P>
        <P>The LRC appointed assessors to draw up a report on whether the company was right to invoke the inability to pay clause of the Sustaining Progress agreement. The assessors&rsquo; report, presented to the LRC and An Post on 2 June this year, concludes that An Post is in a position to pay a 5% payment under Sustaining Progress. It is my understanding, however, that the assessors&rsquo; report finds that An Post cannot afford any further elements of Sustaining Progress or the mid-term review of the national wage agreement other than in the context of securing finalisation on rationalisation and restructuring requirements.</P>
        <P>I understand that An Post intends to pay the recommended 5% increase, back-dated to 1 January 2005, to its employees by the end of this month. However, An Post unions are in disagreement with the findings of the report and the matter will be referred to the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>A real solution to the outstanding difficulties in An Post is for all stakeholders to agree on and implement a viable recovery plan which will enable An Post to deliver quality services to our citizens, while at the same time providing sustainable well-paid employment for its staff. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter and I express appreciation to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and <Col N="1650" />Food, Deputy Smith, for coming into the House to address it.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on a major decentralisation programme in the first week of December 2003. My concern is that since that time, little enough in practical terms has happened in various locations throughout the country, particularly in Macroom where I live and which I represent. However, we have had a number of reports in the meantime from the decentralisation implementation group. There was a report in March last year, a second one in July and a further report in September. In addition, the decentralisation implementation group published a report on 24 November 2004 and I have been informed that the group will report again. We were to receive this report in spring this year and I understand it will be published shortly. Macroom did not come to the fore in the previous reports and it was a matter of great disappointment to me and to the people of Macroom that it was way down the list as regards progress with decentralisation.</P>
        <P>Macroom was not included in the first 15 projects to be relocated and it is of utmost importance that it be included in the next report. I thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for keeping me updated that the accommodation brief in respect of the new laboratories in Macroom is being finalised as a matter of urgency within the Department and that when finalised, the brief will be passed to the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works was given primary responsibility for delivering the property aspects of the decentralisation programme. Great urgency is attached to this matter because the site on which the laboratories stand on the Model Farm Road is earmarked for housing. For this reason, the laboratories earmarked for Macroom will have to be urgently relocated.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The relocation of the laboratories from the Model Farm Road provides the Department with an ideal opportunity to consolidate its laboratory operations in the southern region, encompassing three laboratories in Cork and two in Limerick. I am pleased Macroom will become the regional veterinary headquarters for the Munster region.</P>
        <P>What progress has the Office of Public Works made in acquiring a suitable site or property? If a suitable site or property has been earmarked, when can we expect accommodation to be available for Department staff who have volunteered to decentralise? When will work commence on the programme to provide these facilities in Macroom?</P>
        <P>The employment which will be created in Macroom as a result of decentralisation is urgently needed in the area. The closure in 2000 of GSI, a labour intensive components factory, turned Macroom into an employment blackspot and decentralisation is badly needed to boost the economy of the town.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Donal Moynihan for raising this important issue. As he stated, the Minister for Finance announced the decentralisation of 10,300 public service staff to 53 centres in 25 counties, including eight Department headquarters, in budget 2003.</P>
        <P>The overall decentralisation plan for the Department of Agriculture and Food provides for the relocation of 600 staff, including 200 information technology staff, from Dublin to Portlaoise; the Department&rsquo;s staff in Cork city and Mallow offices to Fermoy, involving approximately 100 staff; the Department&rsquo;s staff in three Cork laboratories and two Limerick laboratories to Macroom, which currently employ some 100 staff; and 69 staff of Bord Bia to Enniscorthy.</P>
        <P>The Cork laboratories to be decentralised are a dairy science laboratory, a veterinary research laboratory and the brucellosis laboratory, all of which are located on the Model Farm Road in Cork. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has agreed to give the land at Model Farm Road, Cork, amounting to approximately ten acres, to the affordable housing initiative. The Limerick laboratories being decentralised are also a dairy science laboratory and a veterinary research laboratory. In addition to the site on Model Farm Road, the relocation to Macroom will free up the sites of the existing dairy science and veterinary research laboratories in Limerick, comprising approximately one acre at Killkeely Road and Knockalisheen.</P>
        <P>The accommodation brief of requirements for the office complex in Portlaoise has been prepared and forwarded to the Office of Public Works. The accommodation brief for the Macroom laboratories is being finalised in my Department and will be sent to the Office of Public Works shortly. The brief will outline the Department&rsquo;s requirements for office staff, laboratories, visitor areas and general service areas for the new <Col N="1652" />laboratory complex. Bringing together these laboratories into one complex in Macroom will enable the Department to introduce a level of rationalisation which will lead to improved operational efficiencies.</P>
        <P>The timeframe for the selection of the site or property and the completion of the development will be a matter for the Office of Public Works which will submit an application for planning permission in due course. The decentralisation implementation group report published on 24 November 2004 provides for 400 posts from my Department to be relocated in the first phase of moves to new Department offices in Portlaoise. It was subsequently announced that 200 information technology posts would also decentralise. This would bring total staff numbers in Portlaoise to approximately 850.</P>
        <P>The moves to Fermoy and Macroom were not included in the first phase. A further report from the decentralisation implementation group is due to issue shortly dealing with other locations. Based on figures released from the central applications facility in September 2004, 91 people have expressed an interest in relocating to Macroom. This number comprises 45 people from within the Department, 41 from other Departments and five from the public service. As yet, however, there is a significant shortfall in Department of Agriculture and Food specialist staff volunteering for Macroom where many of the posts are professional and technical in nature.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Donal Moynihan for raising this important issue. The Deputy has worked extremely hard to outline and highlight the advantages of including his constituency of Cork North-West in the Government&rsquo;s major decentralisation programme. I hope my reply outlines the up-to-date position regarding progress made to date.</P>

        <Quest> if he has plans to address the apparent anomaly whereby those in receipt of the non-contributory pension who save a portion of their pension subsequently exceed the means threshold; if he will state the number of persons this affects; if he plans to rectify this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property, except the person&rsquo;s home. The source of any capital held by a pensioner can and does vary. It can include savings from income while formerly working, savings derived from the sale of property or other assets, savings from occupational or social welfare pensions, gifts, inheritances, accumulated interest or dividends or a combination of these. It would not be possible or practical to distinguish savings derived from a particular source.</P>
        <P>Capital is assessed by reference to a formula laid down in legislation. The initial amount of capital is disregarded before means are assessed. From June 2005, this disregard is increased to &euro;20,000 from approximately &euro;12,700 which applied from October 2000. This means that from the beginning of this month, a pensioner with no other means can have capital of up to &euro;28,000 and still receive a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a couple.</P>
        <P>The enhanced disregard applies to all capital regardless of where it is held, be it in an SSIA, a credit union, with An Post or any other account with a bank or other financial institution or regardless of the initial source of the capital. The new arrangements for capital assessment which I have introduced are designed to ensure that social welfare means testing arrangements do not act as a disincentive to claimants to become savers or penalise those who have been regular savers in the past. I believe that this is a better approach to this issue than to attempt to distinguish different types of capital and apply different rules to them.</P>
        <P>While most pensioners spend all or a sizeable portion of their pension each week in meeting their normal living expenses, some pensioners, however, may choose to save part of their pension. However, such savings which are identified <Col N="1654" />must be treated in the same manner as savings from any other source.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if he has ever had any discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the granting of the family income supplement through the tax system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>Family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might otherwise only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Improvements to the family income supplement scheme, including the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme. Payment of FIS through the tax system has been considered by a working group including the social partners, the remit of which was to examine the role which refundable tax credits could play in the tax and welfare system. While the report of the group has not been finalised, it is expected that it will recommend that FIS continue to be paid by my Department, with a modified system of delivery and sustained efforts to improve take up.</P>
        <P>One of the issues underlying the establishment of the group was a perception that the take up of the FIS scheme was low, that it was not reaching intended beneficiaries to the extent that it might and that payment through the tax and payroll systems might help in that regard. The take up of the scheme peaked at about 14,700 at the end of 1999 but subsequently declined to 11,700 at end September 2002. However, the examination undertaken suggested that some of the perceived disadvantages for eligible persons under the existing system, for example, the need to make an application to a State agency, could apply equally to FIS paid through the tax and payroll systems.</P>
        <P>The examination also suggested that it would probably not be feasible to introduce a system whereby FIS would be paid automatically to eligible persons through the tax and payroll systems and that there would be considerable complexities involved in such a scheme for employers and for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, the numbers availing of the scheme have risen significantly. Average annual numbers of claimants for the years 2002 to 2004 are 11,716, 12,303 and 13,508, respectively. In the week ending 17 June 2005, there were 15,513 claimants. This represents an increase of 29% on the December 2002 figure of 12,043. The improved take up may be due to a number of factors, including generous increases in FIS income thresholds over successive budgets, an increase in the <Col N="1655" />minimum weekly FIS payment to &euro;20, expansion of the economy and greater flexibility in working arrangements.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council<?oasys _jy?>has been commissioned to examine the effectiveness of replacing family income supplement and child dependant allowance with a second tier income support payment targeted specifically at addressing the issue of child poverty. It is expected that this report will be completed later this year.</P>

        <Quest> if it is his Department&rsquo;s policy to pursue unmarried mothers to bring the father of their children to court with the threat that, if they do not, they will lose their entitlement to the rent allowance.</Quest>

        <P>It is a statutory condition of eligibility for one-parent family payment from my Department that applicants are required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouses or, in the case of unmarried applicants, the other parent of their child. Such maintenance is usually obtained by way of negotiation or by court order. In this regard, I am pleased to note that separated couples are increasingly using my Department&rsquo;s family mediation service which is being progressively extended countrywide.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, one-parent family payment claimants are allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance received without reduction in their one-parent family payment, as a further incentive to seek support themselves. There are also disregards where such maintenance is paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest on the lone parent family home. Where social welfare support is being provided to a one-parent family, the other parent is liable under the legislation to contribute an appropriate amount regularly to the Department towards the cost of this payment.</P>
        <P>In every case where a one-parent family payment is awarded, the maintenance recovery unit of my Department seeks to trace the liable relative involved to ascertain whether she or he is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of one-parent family payment. This follow up activity normally takes place within two to three weeks of award of payment. All liable relatives assessed with maintenance liability are notified by the Department and issued with a determination order setting out the amount of contribution assessed. The amount assessed can be reviewed where there is new information about, or changes in, the financial or household circumstances of a liable relative. The Department requires regular payment of the contributions assessed in this way, usually weekly.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement entitlement is a separate matter and does not have any bearing on my <Col N="1656" />Department&rsquo;s work in the maintenance recovery process. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any alternative source.</P>
        <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. In this regard all income, whether in cash or in kind, must be taken into account in determining the amount of assistance payable in each particular case. It is also a condition of eligibility that applicants apply also for any statutory benefits or take appropriate action to seek other income, including maintenance payments, to which they may be entitled.</P>
        <P>In assessing or reviewing entitlement to rent supplement, the Health Service Executive may, depending on the circumstances of a particular case, request a person to seek maintenance from the other parent of their child. In cases where maintenance is being paid, the Health Service Executive may request that additional maintenance be sought if they consider that it is reasonable to do so having regard to the other parent&rsquo;s income. If there is some extenuating reason the rent supplement recipient does not wish to comply with this request, it is open to them to discuss that situation with the community welfare officer.</P>
        <P>It is not the practice within the community welfare service to threaten lone parents with loss of their rent supplement if they do not to bring the father of their children to court for maintenance. However, there are instances where withdrawal or rejection of a rent supplement claim occurs because the failure or refusal by the person concerned to comply with the executive&rsquo;s request is unreasonable in the particular circumstances of the case. Where parents are in a position to make provision for their children, it would be inappropriate for the State to facilitate them in evading their responsibilities in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is standard practice in the community welfare service, in instances where a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to be withdrawn, that applicants are notified in writing, giving notice of the intention to withdraw the payment and outlining the reason for the action. In all instances of refusal or withdrawal of rent supplement, the applicant has the right of appeal. In the first instance an appeal can be determined by an appeals officer in the relevant regional area of the executive. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the outcome of this initial appeal he or she can request that the case be forwarded to the social welfare appeals office for further independent adjudication.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>In its report Securing Retirement Income, published in May 1998, the Pensions Board recommended that the Government should, as part of the overall pensions strategy, run a pension awareness campaign. The campaign was initially launched in 2003 to coincide with the implementation of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 which encompassed many of the recommendations of Securing Retirement Income, including personal retirement savings accounts or PRSAs. The Pensions Board runs the campaign on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>The focus of the campaign is to raise awareness about pensions issues with a view to improving overall pensions coverage. A secondary objective is to ensure that those with pensions coverage are making adequate contributions to ensure a satisfactory income in retirement. While PRSAs are an important part of the overall pensions strategy, the awareness campaign is not focused exclusively on these but rather on pensions provision in general, including occupational schemes and other types of personal pensions provision.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;500,000 was allocated to the campaign each year since 2003 to fund Pensions Board administration costs, media delivery costs, production costs and management fees. The board also intensified some of its normal communication and information work to support the campaign. The board has engaged a number of consultants over the three years to assist with the planning and delivery of the campaign, including Financial Dynamics, Owens DDB and Q4 Public Relations Consultants.</P>
        <P>The campaign involves an integrated advertising and public relations programme using TV, radio, newspapers, on-line facilities, posters and direct mail. Special promotions have also been built around occasions such as the Ploughing Championships. The main event for this year&rsquo;s campaign was held in May, when the Pensions Board ran a successful pensions action week in co-operation with pension providers. Further PR opportunities are being considered for the rest of the year.</P>
        <P>Since their introduction in 2003, some 51,000 personal retirement savings accounts have been opened. Pensions coverage in general has shown a marginal improvement over the last couple of years to 52.4% of the working population while in the key target group, those aged 30 years and over, coverage has reached 59.1%. In terms of pensions awareness, the campaign has been successful in bringing the pensions message to the general public. Consumer awareness research audits show a positive increase in pensions and PRSA awareness from 60% at the end of 2003 to over 70% at the end of last year.</P>
        <Col N="1658" />
        <P>In terms of the future of the campaign, I have asked the Pensions Board to review our overall pensions strategy and I expect to receive a full report on the current position and the possible options for the future in September. Public awareness will be an important element of any new planned initiative. I am also conscious of the opportunities which the maturing of SSIAs next year offer in the context of kick starting pension provision for many people. I will look at a continuation of the campaign in that context.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 59, 60, 68, 71 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. It provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources. As of 24 June last, there were 58,015 households in receipt of assistance under the rent supplement scheme. Just over half of <Col N="1659" />these, almost 30,000 tenants, have been on the scheme for 18 months or more.</P>
        <P>The scheme involves payment in respect of the household in aggregate, without specific additions for adult or child dependants. For this reason, the computer systems used to record rent supplement claims and generate payments does not contain family composition data and, as a result, a detailed breakdown of cases where there are children involved is not readily available. However, my Department has carried out a sample survey of claims which indicates that almost 30,000 rent supplement households have children. There are more than 50,000 children living in households where rent supplement is in payment.</P>
        <P>A significant number of people had come to rely on rent supplements on a long-term basis over recent years. The Government announced a new initiative in July 2004 aimed at meeting the long-term housing needs of these people. The new system gives local authorities responsibility for meeting long-term housing assistance needs, including the needs of those people on rent supplements for 18 months or longer. These needs will be met through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public private partnership type rental accommodation scheme. A total of &euro;19 million has been transferred from my Department&rsquo;s Vote to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Vote this year to help finance this initiative.</P>
        <P>The amount to be transferred in 2006-08 will be considered in the light of the emerging experience of this year&rsquo;s implementation. The amount to be transferred in any one year will depend on the rate at which people move to the new housing arrangements. In overall terms the amount to be transferred will certainly exceed &euro;120 million in aggregate when the new arrangements are fully operational. The funding of the rental accommodation scheme after the three year transition period will be a matter for my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements are currently being implemented in seven local authorities. These are Dublin, Galway and Limerick City Councils and South Dublin County Council, which encompass the most extensive urban areas in the State, Drogheda Town Council, Donegal County Council and counties Offaly and Westmeath. The new arrangements will be initiated in all local authority areas by the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has appointed programme managers to assist the seven lead authorities with the implementation of the new arrangements. Thereafter, these managers will be available to support other authorities over the implementation period. Implementation groups in the seven areas have been established to ensure effective ongoing liaison and co-operation <Col N="1660" />locally between housing authorities, Health Service Executive areas and other agencies.</P>
        <P>The Department has indicated that the lead local authorities are on target to transfer the first eligible rent supplement recipients to the rental accommodation scheme within the next few weeks. The aim of the new system is to minimise ongoing dependence on rent supplement by progressing to a situation where suitable long-term accommodation is available for all who need it. The rent supplement scheme will continue to provide support to those who have short-term housing needs.</P>
        <P>This will be achieved within a period of three years from commencement of the new arrangements in each local authority and in any event no later than September 2008. The scheme will involve structured arrangements to secure long-term availability of privately rented accommodation, particularly accommodation currently occupied by tenants in receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, and to encourage the supply of additional accommodation.</P>
        <P>Overall, the new rental assistance arrangements represent a major step forward in supporting people with long-term housing needs. All of the relevant agencies are co-operating actively to make the system work successfully. The supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement scheme continues to be available to provide short-term income support for people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The jobs facilitation programme was originally established with Government approval in July 1993. Currently, 46 facilitators are supported by ten regional co-ordinators and operate in 34 locations around the country. In April 2004, the jobs facilitation and family support programmes of my Department merged to form the social and family support services, SFSS. This was done to enable the resources at my Department&rsquo;s disposal be utilised in the most effective and efficient manner to assist the most marginalised citizens, including those with disabilities and their families. It was also intended to encourage economic activation amongst those most distanced from the labour market. Job facilitators and family service project officers were renamed facilitators at that time and now operate within a single streamlined network.</P>
        <P>The numbers of persons with a disability assisted onto a progression path by the facilitation network since its introduction are not <Col N="1661" />available. In general terms however, the majority of customers taking up the back to work or back to education options do so with the help and encouragement of their local facilitator. Some 7,000 people transferred from a disability payment to one of my Department&rsquo;s support options during the years 2001 to 2004, inclusive.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures I have already mentioned, my Department operates the special projects fund administered by facilitators, which provides enhanced supports to people, including the long-term ill and people with disabilities, who need additional help to progress to further training and employment. In 2004, 23 special projects catered for people with disabilities at a cost of over &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>As well as the special projects fund, facilitators have access to a separate stream of funding under the national development plan. The aim of these projects is to encourage family members of customers with disabilities to participate in self development programmes or, in some instances, in &ldquo;taster&rdquo; educational programmes. It is hoped that the people involved will move on to more formalised training and educational programmes. In 2004, six projects catered for people with disabilities and their families at a cost of about &euro;66,000.</P>
        <P>Disability benefit and invalidity pension customers may, in certain circumstances, be allowed to work for therapeutic or rehabilitative reasons with a view to improving their prospects of returning to full-time work at a future date. People receiving disability allowance payments can earn up to &euro;120 from this type of work before their income is assessed as means.</P>
        <P>An increasing emphasis is being placed by facilitators on encouraging customers with disabilities to avail of the options available to them, for example, a project to support people with disabilities commenced earlier this year in the midlands. Its objective is to identify a more integrated employment support approach for people with disabilities. This project is being undertaken by my Department in association with the Health Service Executive and F&Aacute;S. My Department&rsquo;s facilitators played an integral part in the operation of the project. It is aimed, initially, at persons aged between 18 to 25 years of age in receipt of disability allowance.</P>
        <P>The information gathered to date from this project is now under review to ascertain how the learning can best be used for the benefit of customers in the future.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 37 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to a scheme of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners resident in all parts of the island. The scheme would enable pensioners resident in Ireland to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland would travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in this State. I am actively examining all the issues and options related to introducing such a scheme.</P>
        <P>In July 1995, my Department introduced the cross-Border free travel scheme. This scheme extended free travel entitlement so that free travel pass holders resident in Ireland could undertake a cross-Border journey from a point of departure in one jurisdiction to a destination in the other jurisdiction free of charge. The Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland does not operate a similar scheme for its customers.</P>
        <P>My Department covers the full cost of cross-Border journeys made by its pass holders as well as the southern element of such journeys undertaken by Northern Ireland pass holders. Under its own concessionary fares scheme, the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland covers the cost of the Northern element of cross-Border bus and rail journeys made by Northern Ireland pass holders. Some 220,000 free cross-Border journeys are undertaken each year at a total cost of &euro;2.9 million; my Department pays &euro;2.5 million and the remaining &euro;0.4 million is covered by the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The introduction of an all-Ireland free travel scheme will further extend the existing arrangements so that all free travel pass holders resident on the island of Ireland may undertake travel free of charge in all parts of the island. It is difficult to estimate the cost of the all-Ireland free travel scheme as this will ultimately depend upon the extent to which pass holders avail of it.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department have regular meetings with their counterparts in the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland concerning the operation of the existing cross-Border free travel scheme. Issues relating to the introduction of the all-Ireland free travel scheme have also been raised at these meetings.</P>
        <P>My officials recently met with representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach on 17 June 2005 in advance of a meeting of the British-Irish Inter-governmental Conference on 27 June 2005 at which the all-Ireland free travel proposal was raised. I will meet with Mr. Shaun Woodward MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at <Col N="1663" />the Northern Ireland Office, shortly during which I will discuss the introduction of a scheme.</P>
        <P>There are a number of policy, operational, financial and technical issues to be discussed and agreed in connection with the new scheme, including the compatibility between the travel passes used in both jurisdictions, resourcing of the scheme and the options for joint funding. My Department will continue to progress these matters with officials from the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland, the Northern and Southern transport companies, the Railway Procurement Agency and other relevant parties.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>My Department has not undertaken any specific research along the lines suggested by the Deputy regarding the information needs of older citizens. However, Comhairle, the national information agency which operates under the aegis of my Department, has recently funded the voluntary organisation, Age Action Ireland, to carry out a research project entitled &ldquo;Uptake of Social Welfare Benefits by Older People&rdquo;. A draft report on this research project has recently been received in my Department and the findings and recommendations outlined in the report will be discussed shortly with Age Action Ireland.</P>
        <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. The underlying objective of my Department&rsquo;s information policy is to ensure that all citizens, including older persons, are made aware of their entitlements in a timely fashion and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur. We continually try to ensure that there are no barriers encountered by our older citizens when trying to access information on all our social welfare schemes and services. My Department has in the recent past held customer consultation sessions with our older customers to ascertain any problems they might have in obtaining information on their entitlements. All of the customer groups concerned indicated their satisfaction at the level of information available from the Department and our dissemination methods.</P>
        <P>The Department takes a proactive approach in advertising new schemes, together with changes and improvements to existing schemes and services, by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. We have, in the past, issued direct information booklets to all <Col N="1664" />our pensioners outlining all the supports and services available to them from the Department.</P>
        <P>Staff of the Department participate at public events promoting social welfare entitlement take up. In addition, they give talks to many organisations, including those offering pre-retirement seminars and courses, and voluntary and community groups to provide presentations on social welfare entitlements. My Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets, including a leaflet entitled Checklist for Pensioners, and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme. These information leaflets are available in a wide range of outlets countrywide, including all social welfare local offices, citizen&rsquo;s information centres, post offices and in a wide range of other organisations such as local community centres.</P>
        <P>The central information services unit in my Department operates a telephone information service for the public and there is an information officer in each of the social welfare local offices around the country. Information officers are available to explain all our supports and services to our older citizens and to help and assist them in completing forms and accessing their entitlements.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 15, 27, 50 and 63 together.</P>
        <P>The one-parent family payment is designed to provide income support to parents with insufficient means who have to parent alone. This can arise as a result of being widowed, or following separation or divorce, or being unmarried. The scheme in its present form largely reflects the reality that applied up to relatively recently, whereby mothers were mainly the full-time carers, with the father being the sole breadwinner. The main aim of the scheme, therefore, has been to provide income support for mothers parenting <Col N="1665" />alone to replace that which would otherwise be provided by the father in a two-parent family. The scheme provides lone parents with the same option that parents have in two-parent families, of rearing their children themselves.</P>
        <P>This reality, however, has been substantially changing in recent years. It is now more common in two-parent families for both parents to work outside the home either on a full-time basis or with one-parent working full-time and the other working part-time. Two-income families are increasingly becoming the norm and international research shows that the risk of poverty for such families is on average less than 4%. One-parent family households are, accordingly, at greater risk of poverty and, if these households are jobless, the risk of poverty is further increased.</P>
        <P>The findings of the recent EU survey on income and living conditions, EU SILC, bear out the findings of previous surveys, and of experience in other developed countries also, that poverty rates tend to be higher among larger families and one-parent families. This is mainly due both to the direct costs of rearing children, including child care costs, and the opportunity costs related to the reduced earning capacity of parents, arising from their care responsibilities. This applies particularly to lone parent families as the lone parent has to be the main breadwinner and carer at the same time.</P>
        <P>The EU SILC figures show that 42.3% of households made up of one adult with children are at risk of poverty, which can be defined as the proportion of the population below an income threshold of 60% of median income. This compares with 22.7% of the population as a whole and 15.3% of two adults with one to three children households. The percentage of lone parent households in consistent poverty was 32.6% compared to 9.4% of total households and 6.5% of two adults and one to three children households.</P>
        <P>The OECD, in a recent report on an international comparative study on reconciling work and family life, found that employment participation among lone parents in this country is among the lowest in the OECD. This is despite the huge employment growth and increasing female participation in the workforce in recent years and the income disregards afforded to lone parents who take up employment. In addition, of those in employment, a high proportion are in relatively low paying part-time employment. This may be due, in part at least, to the fact that availing of the income disregard under the one-parent family payment scheme enables a recipient top up their benefit from part-time employment without foregoing the security of having a regular weekly benefit. However, the report points out that this may be achieved at the price of foregoing better paid full-time employment, greater self sufficiency and a higher standard of living.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to payments under the schemes is also contingent on not cohabiting with another adult either in marriage or outside marriage. This ensures that recipients under the schemes do not <Col N="1666" />gain an advantage over those living together, either married or otherwise, and parenting the children on a joint basis. Reluctance to forgo the income security provided by the one-parent family payment may, however, act as a disincentive to a partnership and ultimately marriage for recipients.</P>
        <P>A sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion is examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information. This group is scheduled to report to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion by the end of July.</P>
        <P>We must also look closely at income supports and at how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for those who receive these payments. In this regard, my Department has established a working group to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. Issues being addressed include the contingency basis of the one-parent family payment, cohabitation, individualisation, maintenance and secondary benefits. The findings of this group will feed into the work of the senior officials sub-group.</P>
        <P>I am also giving consideration to the introduction of a second tier of child income supports, aimed specifically at families in greatest need. A study being carried out at present by the National Economic and Social Council is examining the possibility of amalgamating social welfare child dependant allowances with family income supplement payments. The objective is to provide an integrated channel for resources to low income families without creating disincentives to employment.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the outcome of these reviews will contribute to concrete proposals designed to better support and encourage lone parents in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, and a better future for themselves and their children. These will be the main criteria against which recommendations in the reports will be judged. I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for lone parents and their children by offering them respect and support while avoiding poverty traps.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 25 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>The reduction and eventual elimination of child poverty are at the core of the strategies to combat poverty and social exclusion, a priority shared internationally. The OECD, in a report to Ministers for Social Affairs in April 2005, pointed out that &ldquo;children who grow up in disadvantaged households are more likely to do poorly at school, to struggle to find a job, and to be unemployed, sick or disabled when they become adults, precipitating an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage and deprivation.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Detailed measures to give effect to the strategies to combat child poverty in Ireland are set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and in the national children&rsquo;s strategy. Ending Child Poverty is also one of ten special initiatives in Sustaining Progress. The latest available child poverty data is from the EU survey of income and living conditions, EU SILC, for 2003. The EU SILC indicated that 23.9% of children, equivalent to approximately 200,000, are &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo;, that is, living in households with less than 60% of median equivalised income for their household size. Of these, 120,000 approximately or 14.6% of children are living in households with income below the 60% threshold and experiencing deprivation in at least one of eight indicators considered essential for a decent standard of living in Ireland today.</P>
        <P>The relatively high percentage rates of poverty are, paradoxically, in part due to the major increases in household incomes generally that have occurred due to our unprecedented economic growth and the resulting major expansion in employment. A recent EUROSTAT study, for example, calculated the monetary value of the 60% threshold in terms of purchasing power standards in 2003 for households with two adults and two children. This showed that the threshold in Ireland is now above the EU average in value and ranked eighth highest overall among the EU 25. This means that many households in Ireland with incomes below the 60% threshold, including those with children, may have a better standard of living than similar households classified as not at risk of poverty in other member states.</P>
        <P>I mention this because a misleading impression is often given that the level of poverty in Ireland is among the highest even in the enlarged EU. This comes as a surprise to many, given the improvements that have been made with employment, increases in social welfare payments and in education, health, housing and other essential services. The real challenge, therefore, now is no longer in combating absolute poverty but in addressing the reality that many households, especially those with children, have not managed to secure an adequate share of the growing <Col N="1668" />employment opportunities on offer and in the higher standards of living these provide.</P>
        <P>The Combat Poverty Agency policy statement on ending child poverty, which I recently launched, deals with this reality. The statement identifies three specific areas for attention. These are the need for increased and targeted child income supports; measures to encourage lone parents back to education, training and work, and the delivery of additional child care places. These are fully in line in this regard with my priorities and those of the Government.</P>
        <P>The most significant measure to support families with children in recent years has been the substantial real increases in child benefit payment rates. Between 1997 and 2005, the rate of child benefit rose from &euro;38.09 per month for the first two children and &euro;49.52 for each child thereafter to &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. This equates to real increases in excess of 170%. Child benefit is paid to over 540,000 families in respect of approximately 1 million children, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.916 billion in 2005. It delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family regardless of income levels or employment status. Providing income support in this way thus creates no obstacles to employment and facilitates employment take up by providing significant support with child care costs.</P>
        <P>Through the family income supplement scheme, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay. Recent improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for more lower income households to qualify under the scheme.</P>
        <P>There is now full-time or part-time employment take up in a significant proportion of households with children. These mainly include recipients of the one-parent family payment or of payments in respect of disability and unemployment. In other households with bigger families, only one parent may be able to take up employment, which results in a lower family income. I believe that part of the solution to this may be the introduction of an integrated, second tier of child income support, aimed specifically at families on low income. This would supplement the support provided by child benefit in terms of creating no obstacles to employment and contributing towards the cost of child care in facilitating employment. It would also help to facilitate the option of part-time or full-time parental care for children.</P>
        <P>In developing these policies full account will be taken of the Combat Poverty Agency study and of a forthcoming study under the Ending Child Poverty special initiative by the NESC on amalgamating social welfare child dependant allowances with the family income supplement. The present system of weekly payments and other <Col N="1669" />supports for lone parents may be creating obstacles to employment and thus contributing to growing dependence on these payments and a greater long-term risk of poverty for recipients and their children. This level of dependence does not appear to occur in many other EU countries. I, therefore, fully accept the priority which the Combat Poverty Agency study gives to encouraging people on benefit, including lone parents, back to work. This has already been under active consideration for some time.</P>
        <P>A sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion has been undertaking since last year a detailed examination of obstacles to employment for lone parents. A report will be submitted to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion before the end of July, consideration of which will receive top priority.</P>
        <P>The provision of affordable and flexible child care is also a key factor in facilitating employment participation for families with children. My Department is participating in an interdepartmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children.</P>
        <P>We need to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of the policies being pursued on the development of our children and get the necessary evidence on what works and works well. This process is about to commence with a major national longitudinal study on children which is expected to commence later in 2005. It is being jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study.</P>
        <P>I am confident that through the measures already being taken and the initiatives being planned, which will soon come to fruition, we are making a major contribution to ensuring that vulnerable families and their children have a fair share of the life chances and quality of life, which our prosperity as a nation is already conferring on a majority.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>From 1 May 2004, the requirement to <Col N="1670" />be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and for child benefit. The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.</P>
        <P>The effect of the restriction is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on the application of the guidelines to the individual&rsquo;s circumstances. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>Information held in my Department shows that the majority of migrant workers who came here took up employment and did not make social welfare claims. This is particularly true of those coming from the new member states of the EU. Migrant workers who become unemployed or ill will be entitled to claim unemployment benefit or disability benefit if they satisfy the social insurance contributions for such schemes. In the case of nationals of countries that require work permits, payment will only be made in respect of the unexpired part of their work permit.</P>
        <P>It is possible for migrant workers who have been here for less than two years to satisfy the habitual residence condition for unemployment assistance purposes if it is deemed that their centre of interest is in the State. Again in work permit cases, payment of assistance would only be made in respect of the unexpired part of the work permit.</P>
        <P>The operation of the habitual residence condition has been kept under review by officials of my Department since its introduction. The purpose of the review is to assess the impact of the condition on different categories of claimants, the organisational arrangements and the level of service provided to customers, and to identify opportunities for improvements in the administration of the scheme. The ongoing review enables my officials to identify emerging policy issues and to consider how these should be addressed.</P>
        <P>Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in the area. I expect to be in a position to draw conclusions from the review by the end of the year.</P>

        <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of proposals for extending entitlement for free travel to people living outside Ireland, particularly the UK. During a recent visit to the UK I discussed the logistics of such a recognition scheme with bodies representing the Irish in Britain. With regard to making free travel available to Irish senior citizens living in Britain, consideration has to be given to the EU treaty&rsquo;s prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality. This could mean that, if the scheme were extended along the lines suggested, it may have to be extended to all pensioners who are EU nationals coming to Ireland for temporary stays.</P>
        <P>However, while mindful of possible legal issues, I intend to continue to pursue the logistical elements of such a scheme, as I view it as important in the overall recognition of the contribution of Irish senior citizens over several decades to the growth and prosperity of this country.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 21, 26, 30, 78, 87, 89 and 387 together.</P>
        <P>I recently had the pleasure of launching two important documents from the National Council of Ageing and Older People &mdash;An Age Friendly Society: A Position Document and Planning for an Ageing Population: Strategic Considerations. The concept of a society for all ages, where all generations mingle and are valued equally, is most appealing and must be the goal that we as a nation aspire to as we explore the challenges of planning for an ageing population.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with the national council that we need to identify the values and aspirations we wish to adopt in determining the place older people will have in our society. We also need to realise that older people are a valuable asset and resource to this country and should not be seen as a burden on the State. This is particularly important as we examine policy issues relating to the future financing of long-term care. These issues raise important questions for society.</P>
        <P>My Department carried out a consultation process on the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, which involved detailed consultation with a number of organisations. The feedback from that process has been compiled and has been fed into the long-term care working group. This working group is being chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The objective of the group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. The group will report to the T&aacute;naiste and to me during the summer.</P>
        <Col N="1673" />
        <P>A range of options are being considered to fund long-term care into the future. One of these options is an equity release type mechanism. I have spoken to my Canadian counterpart about his ideas for a scheme that allows homeowners to top up incomes by mortgaging a part of their property. The amount is recouped by the State, or agency acting for the State, when the home is eventually sold. This is referred to as a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo;. Money raised in this way can, I understand, be taken as a lump sum or can be paid in instalments as a regular stream of income over time. There may be some benefits in exploring the introduction of such a system to assist people in supplementing their pension. In Canada the aspiration is that low income older people could raise their annual incomes consistently over time. It is an option that I will explore over the coming months.</P>
        <P>With regard to pensions, I am examining the distinction between contributory and non-contributory pensions and the possibility of adjusting the means test to see to what extent we can provide incentives to older people to remain in employment. This is part of a broader examination of pensions issues which I am undertaking and which gives rise to complex issues and fundamental questions about the way our pensions system is organised. However, I hope to come to some conclusions in this area later this year.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The recent ESRI report on pensioners&rsquo; incomes and replacement rates in 2000 estimated that the income of older couples was 51% of their pre-retirement income, with single pensioners achieving a rate of 43%.</P>
        <P>Since first taking office, the needs of older people have been a priority for this Government. We have sought, through significant increases in pensions and changes to other schemes, to improve the position of older people. Since 1997, we have increased pensions by up to &euro;80.26 per week or 81%. Over the same period the increase in the consumer price index was 30.7% while average earnings increased by 51%.</P>
        <P>At the same time, we have eased qualifying conditions so that more people can now receive contributory pensions. Additional household schemes have also been made available to all those over 70 years of age regardless of their income or household composition. The programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the basic State pension to &euro;200 by 2007 and further progress will be made in the 2006-07 period. The maximum rate of contributory old age pension now stands at &euro;179.30.</P>
        <P>Under the national pensions policy initiative, published by the Pensions Board in 1998, the board proposed a rate of 34% of gross average industrial earnings for contributory pensions based on average earnings for the previous year. <Col N="1674" />On that basis the current rate of pension is equivalent to almost 32%. A statutory review of pensions coverage and related issues is required to be completed by September 2006. In February, I asked the Pensions Board to commence work on a comprehensive review of our overall pensions strategy. Work on the review is ongoing and will include an examination of the appropriateness of the original targets suggested in the national pensions policy initiative for social welfare pensions and the total income of pensioners, taking account of the ESRI report.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to ensure that the report is completed in the shortest possible timescale so that I can review the situation and decide what further action is required in this area. I expect to receive the report of the Pensions Board in September.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 34 and 52 together.</P>
        <P>The relative income poverty indicator measures the proportion of people below the threshold of 60% of median income. People with income below that threshold are considered by the EU to be &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo;. The consistent poverty indicator identifies those below the 60% median income threshold who are also experiencing deprivation in goods and services considered essential for a basic standard of living in Ireland. There are eight indicators of deprivation chosen on the basis of surveys of what Irish people consider essential for a basic standard of living.</P>
        <P>Across EU member states a new EU survey on income and living conditions, EU SILC, is the principal source of data on these and other indicators. The survey is conducted in Ireland by the Central Statistics Office. It replaces the living in Ireland survey, LIIS, which was conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, <Col N="1675" />until 2001. Ireland was among the first set of five countries to introduce EU SILC in 2003.</P>
        <P>That survey reported that 22.7% of persons were at risk of poverty in 2003, which represents a slight increase on the 2001 figure of 21.9%. It is the case that when countries experience rapid economic growth, as occurred in Ireland in the 1990s, the incidence of relative poverty can increase as a result of the increase in incomes generally, for example, it rose in Ireland from 15.6% to 20.9% during a period of high economic growth between 1994 and 2000. However, if we use the &ldquo;anchored poverty line approach&rdquo; over the same time frame based on increases of the poverty threshold by the rate of increases in consumer prices only, the level of poverty actually falls by 55.9%.</P>
        <P>The impact of general rises in income is also illustrated by a recent EUROSTAT study. This gives the monetary value of the 60% median threshold for a household with two adults and two children in 2003 in terms of purchasing power standards. It shows that the value for Ireland is above the EU average and eighth highest overall. This means that many households in Ireland with incomes below the 60% threshold have a better standard of living than similar households classified as not at risk of poverty in other member states.</P>
        <P>The relative income approach, of course, only measures income. It does not take account of the high level of home ownership, especially among the elderly, and consequently of the value to households of owning their own home. It also does not reflect access to household allowances in kind such as electricity, fuel, telephone rental and TV licence.</P>
        <P>The EU-SILC survey reported that 10.2% of households experienced consistent poverty in 2003, up from 5.2% in 2001 under the earlier LIIS survey. However, both the CSO and the ESRI have made it clear that methodological differences between the two surveys mean that the figures for 2001 and 2003 are not comparable and that it is, therefore, not possible to conclude from them how consistent poverty changed during this period.</P>
        <P>There is no reason to believe that there has been a worsening in basic deprivation levels in recent years. Between 2001 and 2005, spending on social welfare has increased from &euro;7.8 billion to &euro;12.2 billion. During the same period the lowest social welfare rates have increased by 40% while the consumer price index has increased by just over 13%. As a result of budget 2005, welfare payments have increased by three times the expected rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, what is not in question from the survey results are the groups who are identified as being most at risk of poverty and deprivation. EU- SILC confirms the findings of earlier surveys in this regard. The most vulnerable groups are families with children, especially lone parents and larger families, those who are unemployed or <Col N="1676" />with disabilities and the elderly, especially women living alone.</P>
        <P>For those of working age the best route out of poverty is employment and this includes lone parents and those with disabilities, as well as the unemployed. This requires ensuring that social welfare payments are organised and administered in ways that are employment friendly. It also involves providing the necessary supports, such as education and training, employment services and affordable child care. The development of policies to meet these challenges is now a top priority with, for example, high level working groups examining how best to enable lone parents overcome the obstacles to employment they face and on how best to further develop the provision of affordable child care. Similar strategic and coordinated approaches are being developed for those with disabilities and the elderly.</P>

        <P>My objective is to ensure that a wide choice of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually improved by providing access to an increasing range of payment outlets and facilities. Currently, 520,000 of my Department&rsquo;s customers receive their payment direct to their accounts at banks, building societies and other financial institutions. In order for my Department to issue payments to an account, the financial institution must have access to the electronic clearing system. Credit unions do not have access to these facilities at present and, therefore, cannot receive direct payments from my Department.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Irish League of Credit Unions is currently working with Bank of Ireland to develop a solution which would give credit unions access to the electronic clearing system. Development work is at an advanced stage and my Department has been requested to assist with the testing of the solution by issuing trial payments. Development work is ongoing between the bank and the credit unions and my Department will continue to assist with the testing of the system as requested.</P>
        <P>When regulatory approval is obtained and all parties are satisfied that payments can reach the nominated account securely and on time, and that the customer can easily access their payment on the due date, my Department will agree a commencement date for the service with the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
        <P>As the development and the regulatory issues are outside the control of my Department it is not possible to set a timeframe by which payments to credit union accounts will take place. However, I am hopeful that most of the issues can be <Col N="1677" />finalised by the end of the year and that social welfare customers will be able to receive their payments in credit union accounts thereafter.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 38 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides child income support in a number of ways. The principal support is child benefit, which is neutral <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the employment status of the child&rsquo;s parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. Over the period since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by &euro;103.51 at the lower rate and &euro;127.78 at the higher rate, increases of 272% and 258% respectively. Child benefit rates now stand at &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child.</P>
        <P>Child dependant allowances are paid in addition to weekly social welfare payments. Since 1994, successive Governments have held the rate of child dependant allowances constant while concentrating resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme. It is important to recognise that over that period, the combined child benefit-child dependant allowance payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families, including lone parent families, at work on low pay, through the family income supplement scheme. A number of improvements have been made to the scheme over the years, including the assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council is examining the merging of child dependant allow<Col N="1678" />ances with the family income supplement scheme, as a way of addressing the issue of child poverty by channelling resources to low income families without creating disincentives to employment. I look forward to receiving the NESC report in the near future.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 29, 32, 42, 48, 56, 69, 77, 84, 388 and 403 together.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person.</P>
        <P>According to census 2002, there are 48,500 people providing personal care for over four hours per day. Just over 24,200 of these are in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. This means that 50% of the 48,500 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than four hours per day, are in receipt of a specific carer&rsquo;s payment from my Department.</P>
        <P>I have been conscious, however, that there are carers who, because they are not in need of income support and consequently do not qualify for a weekly payment from my Department, feel that their contribution is not being recognised. For that reason, in the last budget I made provision to extend the annual respite care grant to all carers who are providing medically certified full-time care to a person who needs such care. This is also subject to some employment related conditions. This means that the respite care grant is now available to all carers who are providing medically certified full-time care. Accordingly, carers who are receiving a social welfare payment or those who are qualified adults on another person&rsquo;s pension or those who are not currently receiving a weekly social welfare payment may now qualify for a respite care grant from my Department.</P>
        <P>The amount of the grant increased from &euro;835 to &euro;1,000 in June 2005. Provision has also been made to pay a grant in respect of each care recipient, where previously the grant was only available for up to two people. This benefits those who provide care for three or more people. I expect that this measure will benefit over 9,000 carers who are not currently in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. Overall, some 33,000 full-time carers will receive the grant at a cost of &euro;36 million this year.

        <P>I recently had the pleasure of launching the Carers Association&rsquo;s Towards a Carer&rsquo;s Strategy. It is a focused document with clear objectives and actions. These objectives and actions cover a range of areas and Government Departments, including income support and health related issues. With regard to a policy framework for the future funding of long-term care for older people, the long-term care working group, which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, is continuing its work. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme. The group will report to the T&aacute;naiste and myself during the summer.</P>
        <P>I will also continue to work with my colleagues in Government to develop the type of co-ordinated services which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 75 together.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive on my behalf. The scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing programme of expenditure reviews. The review is being carried out by a working group chaired by my Department and includes the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive. The review involves a fundamental appraisal of the scheme. All aspects are being examined, with a primary focus on considering ways of improving its efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Due to the number and nature of the issues raised, the working group decided to progress the review in two phases. Phase I of the review was completed at the end of 2004. This is a preliminary phase, outlining the background to the scheme, its current format, the trends in recipient numbers and expenditure. It also addresses the objectives of the scheme and their relevance in <Col N="1681" />the context of Government and departmental policy and strategies. In this first phase the working group carried out an extensive consultation process. This resulted in 145 submissions being received by the working group. Over 700 issues were raised in these submissions. The report of phase I of the review has been published and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Phase II of the review commenced in January 2005. This involves a full examination of the issues raised in the submissions received and conclusions by the group in phase 1. The group is due to complete its work by the end of 2005 and will make recommendations on the future of the scheme based on its conclusions.</P>
        <P>The recent establishment of the Health Service Executive requires a fresh consideration of the role and structure of the community welfare service and of the most appropriate location for that service in the future. I will address, later this year, the most appropriate administrative arrangements for the scheme in the light of recent changes.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>My Department aims, through the provision of a range of supports, to encourage and assist people with disabilities and long-term illnesses who are in receipt of social welfare payments to identify and take up available employment, training and other self development opportunities, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>This is achieved through a number of measures which include: exemptions from the general &ldquo;no work&rdquo; conditions which apply to the contributory illness and disability payments &mdash; with the prior approval of the Department, a person may be exempted from these conditions so as to engage in employment or training of up to 20 hours per week which is considered to be rehabilitative or therapeutic in nature; earnings disregards in the case of means tested payments, disability allowance and blind pension, for those engaging in rehabilitative employment or self employment and rehabilitative training; participation in the back to work scheme, whereby people on long-term illness and disability payments can retain <Col N="1682" />those payments on a sliding scale for three years where they take up full-time employment in the open labour market, four years where engaged in self employment; the jobs facilitator network, which assists people to return to work, training and education by advising them of the options available, encouraging them to take up these options and providing supports, where necessary; and exemptions from liability for employer and employee PRSI contributions, in certain instances.</P>
        <P>The earnings disregard for those in receipt of means tested payments engaging in rehabilitative employment has been increased on a number of occasions since the transfer of the then disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, DPMA, from the health boards to my Department as disability allowance in 1996. At that time, the disregard was £35.20, equivalent of &euro;44.69, increased to £36.30 or &euro;46.09 from 4 June 1997 and to £50 or &euro;63.49 from 3 June 1998. It was then increased to £75 or &euro;95.23 from 5 April 2000 and also extended to self employment and to its current level of &euro;120 from April 2002. Any further change to this disregard would have budgetary implications and would have to be considered in the context of overall available resources.</P>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s expenditure review initiative, a working group established in my Department reviewed the range of existing illness and disability schemes and identified a number of areas where employment support could be strengthened within the social welfare system and across Government Departments generally. I will consider what improvements can be made in the light of this review and with a view to any necessary measures being considered in the context of the next budget.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that a wide range of payment options are available to customers. Payment options that are currently available include post office payments by means of a personalised pension order, PPO, book, postdrafts or electronic interface transfer, EIT, using a swipe card, cheque payments to customers at their home address and direct payment to customers&rsquo; bank accounts via electronic fund transfer, EFT. Customers may also switch between payment method where their circumstances warrant it.</P>
        <P>When pension payments made by EFT first commenced, they were made four weeks in arrears. However, following a review of payment frequencies, pension payments by EFT moved to <Col N="1683" />two weeks in arrears in April 2000. This situation was again reviewed in 2004 and it was further reduced to one week in arrears in November of that year.</P>
        <P>The majority of customers who opt for the EFT facility do so at the start of their claim and are paid on a regular weekly basis once their claim is put into payment.</P>
        <P>Under current arrangements, customers wishing to change from a post office book to EFT move to a different payment cycle and, as a result, do not receive payment for one week during the switch over. The further alignment of EFT payments with that of other payment methods, including the elimination payments being made one week in arrears, is being addressed and the necessary arrangements will be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I also recently announced a comprehensive review of my Department&rsquo;s payment systems. This review will take account of Government policy to facilitate the greater use of electronic payments systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland.</P>

        <P>Considerable progress has already been made in this regard with the qualified adult allowance on the contributory payment now standing at &euro;138.50 or 83% of the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension, currently &euro;166.00 per week. Overall increases in the qualified adult allowance on the old age contributory pension amount to &euro;56.47 per week since April 2000.

        <P>The national action plan on inclusion provides for an integrated approach across all relevant policy areas for combating poverty and social exclusion, in line with the process established under the EU open method of co-ordination. This requires action not only at national level but also at regional and local level.</P>
        <P>The office for social inclusion in my Department is responsible for co-ordinating and driving the plan, working closely with all relevant Departments and with the social partners through the social inclusion consultative group. Direct responsibility for social inclusion at local authority level rests with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who, I understand, recently provided detailed information on progress to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years my Department, through the office for social inclusion, has worked with that Department and the Combat Poverty Agency in supporting the development and implementation of a local government anti-poverty learning network. This network has contributed significantly to the promotion of a strong local anti-poverty focus within the reformed system of local government. It provides a forum in which local authorities can share experiences and best practice and consider how to make the maximum contribution to policies to tackle poverty and social exclusion.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the national action plan on inclusion is regularly monitored and the outcomes achieved are evaluated. This process is part of the co-ordination undertaken by the office for social inclusion and involves Government Departments, the senior officials groups on social inclusion and the social partners. A report on the implementation of the 2003-2005 National Action Plan, for submission to the European Commission, is being finalised at present and will highlight, <i>inter alia</i>, the significant progress being made at local level to address poverty and social inclusion. This will include reference not only to services provided directly by local authorities but to all relevant State services administered at regional and local level.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions No. 44, 67 and 375 together.</P>
        <P>Family income supplement, FIS, was introduced in 1984 to provide income support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where they might otherwise only be marginally better off than if they were fully reliant on social welfare payments. Weekly payments of FIS are made to families, including one-parent families, with children under 18 years or between 18 and 22 years if in full-time education, where one or more parent is in full-time remunerative employment of not less than 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight, where the employment is likely to last at least three months and where the income of the family is less than a prescribed weekly amount.</P>
        <P>The number of FIS claims in payment at week ending 17 June 2005 is 15,513. This represents an increase of 29% since December 2002 when 12,043 claims were in payment. FIS income limits were increased by &euro;39 per week in budget 2005. This represents a net increase of &euro;23.40 per week for most recipients. Weekly FIS income limits have risen by &euro;84 since 2002. This represents a net increase of &euro;50.40. The guaranteed minimum weekly rate of payment for anyone who qualifies for FIS increased to &euro;20 from January 2004.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to estimate the number of families who fail to apply for their entitlements under the family income supplement scheme. However, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the living in Ireland survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure. I understand that the <Col N="1686" />ESRI is looking again at this issue given the availability of new data since that time.</P>
        <P>My Department undertakes a number of proactive measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to family income supplement. In the past, this has included extensive advertising on local and national press and radio, in poster campaigns and targeted mailshots. Information on FIS is also provided on an ongoing basis in various ways, which include advising all newly awarded one-parent family payment recipients, advising all employers annually in PRSI mailshots and examining entitlement for all recipients of the back to work scheme.</P>
        <P>The provision of information on FIS in this manner is not costed separately. More generally, information on all social welfare schemes, including FIS, is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website and from the Department&rsquo;s local offices.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 374 together.</P>
        <P>The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 provides that the minimum wage rate for an experienced adult employee from 1 May 2005 is &euro;7.65 per hour. The national minimum wage continues to have a significant impact on the earnings of many thousands of low paid workers. This was the fourth increase in the national minimum wage and was agreed between the Government and the social partners under the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>The level of the PRSI contribution payable in any week is for the most part determined by the level of reckonable earnings in that week and by the appropriate PRSI rate. The rate at which the PRSI is due can vary significantly depending on the level of earnings. The system of PRSI contributions, which includes payment of the health levy where appropriate, operates using a range of tiered contribution rates which vary for employer <Col N="1687" />and employees corresponding to weekly non-cumulative thresholds and a weekly non-cumulative PRSI allowance, subject to an annual cumulative ceiling on employee contributions.</P>
        <P>These tiered PRSI contributions and allowances link the percentage of PRSI payable to the level of reckonable earnings in a given contribution week so as to ensure that the system is largely progressive up to the value of the annual ceiling. The tiered system also enhances employment incentives for low earning employees so as to ensure they do not bear a financial disadvantage from the payment of social insurance contributions.</P>
        <P>From an employee point of view, a key PRSI threshold currently stands at &euro;287 per week, which is the level above which the modified employee PRSI rate of 0.9% or standard employee PRSI rate of 4% is payable. At this threshold point, the employee rate becomes operable for all earnings, although contributors are then entitled to a PRSI free allowance of &euro;26 or &euro;127 per week, as appropriate, which reduces the &ldquo;step-effect&rdquo; of the threshold.</P>
        <P>There are no provisions under social welfare law to exempt earnings paid at the minimum wage from liability for social insurance contributions. Any changes in the PRSI free allowances, thresholds and ceilings are considered in a budgetary context. It is worthwhile noting that workers in the circumstances that the Deputy sets out received an increase of over 6% on their previous earnings despite the application of PRSI. The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to ensure that low paid workers and other vulnerable workers do not suffer undue hardship from the operation of the PRSI system.</P>

        <P>My Department tries to assist and encourage long-term unemployed, people with disabilities and other long-term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service. The back to work allowance scheme incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self employment.</P>
        <P>My Department also administers the back to education allowance programme which is available to people who need to obtain educational <Col N="1688" />qualifications before re-entering the labour market. It also operates a special projects fund, administered by facilitators based in social welfare local offices, which enables facilitators to provide enhanced supports to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment. The groups who may need special help of this nature include the long-term ill and people with disabilities. In 2004, 23 special projects catered for people with disabilities at a cost of over &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>The Department also operates small scale family services projects in certain areas, which are designed to focus supports towards specific target groups with complex needs, including people with disabilities. The provision of this additional support involves individual attention, customised information and enhanced access to services. It can increase the capacity of those in the most difficult circumstances, including people with disabilities, to improve their self esteem and personal situations through access to basic education, training and developmental opportunities.</P>
        <P>It is hoped that by encouraging customers with disabilities to participate in self development programmes and, in some instances, &ldquo;taster&rdquo; educational programmes that they will move on to more formalised training and educational programmes. In 2004, six projects catered for people with disabilities and their families at a cost of &euro;66,240.</P>
        <P>The special projects and family services initiatives are based on the application of a partnership approach between my Department, the voluntary and community sector, the private sector and other local players in identifying and addressing local needs in terms of training and development for people dependent on social welfare payments, including people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Customers in receipt of certain illness related payments such as disability allowance, disability benefit and invalidity pension are not debarred from working while in receipt of these payments, subject to meeting certain criteria. Disability allowance is means tested and any income received would be assessed as means subject, however, to the current income disregard of &euro;120 per week. Disability benefit and invalidity pension customers may, in certain circumstances, be allowed to undertake work for rehabilitative reasons with a view to improving their prospects of returning to full-time work at a future date.</P>

        <P>My Department issues approximately 1.1 million weekly payments, of which 58% are <Col N="1689" />paid through An Post. Some 643,000 customers are paid electronically by my Department. Payments can be made by electronic fund transfer direct to a customer&rsquo;s account with a financial institution, including An Post, or by electronic information transfer to a post office where the customer can access the payment by means of a social welfare card.</P>
        <P>At present, some 800,000 customers on long-term schemes are paid by means of a book of personalised payable orders which are encashable each week at a post office designated by the customer. My objective is to ensure that a wide choice of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually improved by providing access to an increasing range of payment services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have recently announced a review of my Department&rsquo;s payment methods with a view to identifying a payment solution which will meet the needs of customers in the future while at the same time complying with the Government&rsquo;s e-services agenda. This review, which is under way, will look at all the payment options used by my Department and will seek information on how best to deliver social welfare payments in the future. I expect the review will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The range and type of services which An Post provides to its customers is, in the first instance, a commercial matter for the company. I have no role or function in this regard. I am aware that An Post is mindful of the need to move to a more modern payment system. My expectation, however, is that An Post will respond to developments and product innovation in the money transmission market so that it can maintain its position as a leading player in this area of commercial activity.</P>
        <P>In 1999, my Department&rsquo;s payment delivery arrangements with An Post were extended following a Government decision on the matter. This gave rise to a complaint being lodged with the European Commission in 2000. The complaint was subsequently referred to the European Court of Justice by the European Commission. An undertaking given to the European Commission precludes my Department from entering into any arrangement with An Post which would alter the terms of the current payment delivery service.</P>
        <P>Pending a judgment on the complaint, the current arrangements which exist between my Department and An Post for the delivery of social welfare payments will continue.</P>

        <Quest> if his Department has carried out a recent evaluation of supplementary welfare allowance rent caps with a view to revis<Col N="1690" />ing caps to reflect actual current market rates for quality accommodation.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
        <P>The limits currently in place came into force with effect from January 2004. Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, breach the rent levels as an exceptional measure. This discretionary power is only used in special cases but it ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department is in regular contact with the community welfare staff of the Health Service Executive regarding the various elements of the scheme. In the course of these ongoing contacts, the prescribed upper limits on rent levels supported under the rent supplement scheme have not emerged as having a detrimental impact on the ability of eligible tenants generally to secure suitable rented accommodation to meet their needs. In 2004, over 41,000 rent supplement claims were awarded and so far this year over 19,000 claims have been awarded.</P>
        <P>My officials are reviewing the current levels of rent limits to determine what limits should apply from later this year. The review is taking account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, based on indices from the Central Statistics Office, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation according to patterns of rent supplement applications within each of its operational areas. Data published by the CSO suggest that rent levels rose by 1.5% in the last six months. Rents fell by about 10% over the previous two and a half years.</P>
        <P>The review has also included consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In addition, the Irish Council for Social Housing and a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area have made detailed submissions. This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country and that they will continue to enable the different cat<Col N="1691" />egories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs. I intend to introduce new regulations on this shortly.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 54, 61, 66, 81 and 373 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has a number of services available to assist individuals and families, primarily <Col N="1692" />those on low income, to manage their finances and to open up alternative credit options in their local credit union. My Department has overall responsibility for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing difficulty in meeting repayments on borrowings. There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service.</P>
        <P>The MABS programme provides money advice, including the publication of information on money management and debt counselling, to individuals and families who have problems with debt, particularly indebtedness to moneylenders, and who are on low incomes or are in receipt of social welfare payments. The service places an emphasis on practical budget based measures that help people to move permanently from dependence on moneylenders and to access alternative sources of low cost credit. In the year ending December 2004, MABS dealt with over 16,000 new clients and 13,600 are being dealt with on an on going basis.</P>
        <P>I recently launched the OPEN report Do the Poor Pay More? which was funded by the money advice and budgeting service and the Combat Poverty Agency. The report shows that many lone parents do not have access to mainstream banking and are therefore more likely to be indebted to high interest lenders such as moneylenders and hire purchase companies. Having considered the various findings and recommendations in the report regarding the practices of the utility companies and the financial industry, I held a series of meetings with the Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation, IBF, ESB, Irish League of<?oasys _jy?>Credit Unions, ILCU, and the financial services regulator.</P>
        <P>The meeting with the IBF focused on the following four issues: access to mainstream banking facilities, including credit options where appropriate, for lone parents and others on social welfare or low incomes; responsible lending practices to lone parents and others on welfare or low incomes; operationalisation of guidance notes regarding customer identification at local branch level; continued co-operation with the MABS service in dealing with over indebtedness issues when appropriate.</P>
        <P>With regard to these specific matters, the banks have agreed to communicate with all retail member banks to ensure that staff are reminded of account opening procedures and the attendant customer identification requirements, including the range of documentation which will satisfy these requirements. They will also be in contact with the financial services regulator, IFSRA, to discuss how they might help promote their publication, A guide to opening a Bank Account.</P>
        <P>The meeting with the ESB centred around the rate of interest being charged on its hire purchase agreements by FinancElectric. The ESB explained that its scoring system is more flexible than that of financial institutions and as a result it needs to charge a higher rate of interest.<?oasys _jy?>FinancElectric charges interest at various rates <Col N="1693" />and some of its finance products are interest free. I have asked the ESB, in the context of the sale of its retail business, to ensure that in any transfer that takes place, those on low incomes and social welfare payments who are experiencing difficulty in servicing existing loans are treated in a sympathetic fashion.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.7-?>
        <P>The credit union movement has played a significant role in facilitating the development of the MABS. When I met with the Irish League of<?oasys _jy?>Credit Unions I was given every assurance that it would continue to play its part in assisting persons on welfare payments and low incomes to be financially included. It undertook to meet with the One Parent and Exchange Network and other interested groups to respond to issues highlighted in the OPEN research. A follow up meeting has since taken place between OPEN, MABS and the ILCU to investigate the possibility of introducing credit products to attract those who are currently borrowing from moneylenders.</P>
        <P>I also met with the financial services regulator. He is currently undertaking research into issues surrounding access to financial services in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency. I look forward to getting this report, which is intended to be available later this year. The report will be of assistance in further developing appropriate policy responses to financial inclusion.</P>
        <P>A good working relationship exists between MABS, the IBF, ILCU, utility companies and the financial regulator. Regular meetings take place regarding debt recovery practices between the service and these bodies and I have requested that my officials keep me briefed on developments.</P>
        <P>Through its operation of the household budget scheme with An Post, my Department also assists people who receive certain social welfare payments with money management by enabling them to pay a regular amount towards various household bills by direct deduction from their payments. This scheme is used mainly to cover local authority rents and mortgages and utilities. There is provision under the supplementary allowance scheme, through its exceptional needs payments, whereby persons may qualify for once-off payments from the community welfare service to help prevent undue hardship at times of exceptional expenditure.</P>
        <P>I believe financial inclusion is vital in the context of social inclusion overall and I will continue to monitor developments in this area.</P>

        <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of <Col N="1694" />the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, reported in September 2001. While it did not prove possible to reach consensus on the desirability of establishing a formal benchmark for social welfare rates, the group did produce the following majority recommendation:</P>
        <P LI="1">Recognising that the exact rate was a matter for Government, and having balanced the various factors set out in the terms of reference, the majority of the Group considered that the target of 27% of GAIE [Gross Average Industrial Earnings] (on a current-year basis) for the lowest social welfare payments was not an unreasonable policy objective.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to child related payments, the group recommended that the appropriate equivalence level of basic child income support should be set at 33%-35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate. The report of the group fed into the national anti-poverty strategy published in 2002. This revised strategy contains a specific commitment to:</P>
        <P LI="1">To achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rates of social welfare to be met by 2007 and the appropriate equivalence level of basic child income support (i.e. Child Benefit and Child Dependent Allowances combined) to be set at 33%-35% of the minimum adult personal rate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This commitment was also reiterated in An Agreed Programme for Government and Sustaining Progress. In addition, An Agreed Pro-<?oasys _jy?>gramme for Government also contains a commitment to &ldquo;increase the basic State Pension to at least &euro;200 by 2007&rdquo;. The achievement of these commitments requires levels of increase well ahead of projected price inflation over the period. Considerable progress has already been made and I was happy to increase the lowest rates of welfare payments by over 10% in the last budget, an increase over four times ahead of projected inflation for the year. In addition, the level of child income support was maintained within the target equivalence levels provided for in the NAPS.</P>
        <P>Over the period since 1997, the lowest social welfare rate has increased by 79% or a real increase ahead of price inflation of 37%. Over the same period, the rate of old age contributory pension has increased by 81% or a real increase of over 39%. I look forward to making further progress towards completing these ambitious commitments in the rates of welfare payments in the next two years.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The scheme is intended to benefit people who had difficulty finding employment because of a lack of educational qualifications. In many cases, people who have not completed second level education are held back in their efforts to obtain employment because of this. The qualification period for people who wish to pursue second level education is six months and the numbers taking second level education with the support of BTEA are increasing.</P>
        <P>The conditions for entitlement to the third level option of the back to education allowance were revised with effect from September 2004. From that date, the qualifying period was increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study. I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme to 12 months in last December&rsquo;s budget. I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from &euro;254 to &euro;400. These changes will take effect from 1 September 2005.</P>
        <P>I have undertaken to the D&aacute;il and the social affairs committee that I will continue to keep the qualifying period for this scheme under regular review. I have requested my officials to further examine the current arrangements to ensure that the scheme supports those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest. In particular, I have requested that they examine how the scheme might be accessed by people in need of further education who have been identified under the employment action plan operated by F&Aacute;S in conjunction with my Department. I expect to be in a position to finalise this matter in July.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council was established to consider strategic issues relating to the efficient development of the economy, the achievement of social justice and the development of a strategic framework for the conduct of relations and negotiation of agreements between the Government and the social partners. The council is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and contains representatives of trade unions, employers, farmers&rsquo; organisations, NGOs, key Government Departments and independent experts. The Secretary General of my Department is a member of the council and the NESC in its acknowledgements paid particular tribute to the contribution of my Department to the drafting of the report.</P>
        <P>The NESC&rsquo;s report, entitled The Developmental Welfare State, examines the evolution of the Irish welfare state, considers the serious social deficits that remain despite Ireland&rsquo;s economic progress and proposes a framework in which these deficits might be addressed, necessarily over an extended period. As with many NESC reports in the past, it addresses major issues of strategic importance as a contribution to debate on those issues. I envisage that the report will bring a similar level of debate to the social policy area as it has to economic development.</P>
        <P>In the shorter term, the report will inform the forthcoming discussions that will feed into the NESC&rsquo;s next strategy statement which may in turn influence thinking on a successor social partnership agreement to Sustaining Progress. NESC identifies as a key challenge the need for Ireland to devise a system of social protection in its widest sense rather than focusing on social welfare payments. NESC suggests that the welfare system should be seen as consisting of three overlapping elements: tax and welfare transfers, the provision of services; initiatives, such as the national disability strategy, which are more activist in addressing social problems.</P>
        <P>The report makes a number of observations about income supports and, in particular, addresses the need to support people in moving back to employment while providing adequate support for those who cannot. While many of the recommendations in this regard resonate with efforts to make the social welfare system more active since the early 1990s, the NESC model allows these efforts to be seen in a more integrated fashion and strengthens the arguments for intensifying them.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;activist measures&rdquo; encompasses a range of initiatives, including active labour market programmes such as the back to work allowance, the &ldquo;special projects&rdquo; developed and supported by the Department&rsquo;s social and family support service, programmes to tackle edu<Col N="1697" />cational disadvantage, such as the school completion, school meals and back to education programmes, and locally driven projects that seek to tackle various aspects of social exclusion.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that the NESC report will be influential in the coming years in the development of policy relating to social welfare and social development in general.</P>

        <P>My Department has held discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding aspects of the arrangements governing the collection and disposal of domestic waste. The matter is also being discussed through the social partnership process.</P>
        <P>The discussions between the Departments have focused on establishing the facts about the level of charges for domestic waste management and the increasing role played by commercial operators in this area. It is clear from those discussions that this is a complex and evolving issue. The range of charges imposed varies considerably from area to area and from operator to operator. In addition, even where the total charges imposed by operators may be similar, the charging regimes vary quite considerably.</P>
        <P>The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for the each local authority and a number have done so. The introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue is not considered feasible given the wide range of charging regimes and cost levels that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State. Any system put in place to assist people who rely on private domestic waste collection would have to be sensitive to the different local arrangements.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission wrote to the Government on 22 December 2004 setting out a legal analysis of the new condition and its application to workers and their families. The Commission raised a number of issues concerning its compliance with EU law. Officials of my Department are currently engaged in discussion with the EU Commission officials with a view to clarifying the operation of the condition and addressing any issues raised. It is expected that these discussions will be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>I am not aware that the habitual residence condition is causing hardship to persons arriving in Ireland. The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</P>
        <P>In addition, the operation of the habitual residence condition has been kept under review by officials of my Department since its introduction. A more systematic review of the operation of the condition is being carried out at present by my officials with a view to: assessing its impact on different categories of persons claiming social assistance-child benefit and supplementary welfare allowance payments; assessing the current organisational arrangements in the Department for administering the condition and the service provided to customers; identifying opportunities for improvements to the administration of the scheme, including those aspects involving other <Col N="1699" />Departments; examining all aspects of the decision making process; and identifying emerging policy issues and considering how these should be addressed.</P>
        <P>Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in the area. I expect the review to be completed by the end of the year.</P>

        <P>People are only identifiable in the social welfare scheme as parents when they have child dependants. Traditionally, the father was the main and often the sole breadwinner, with the mother, as the main care giver, being regarded as dependent on the father. Implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in recent decades has in fact involved making the social welfare system both more mother and father friendly.</P>
        <P>The mother, as normally the primary care giver, now generally receives child benefit payments which before had been payable to the father as the main breadwinner. There are no longer differences in payments or in eligibility conditions for men and women under the social welfare system and the concept of dependency has largely been removed. Both men and women are equally eligible for benefits or pensions if they become a lone parent but the majority of lone parents, some 88.5%, are women.</P>
        <P>Recognition of the mother as primary care giver has meant that where the parents are separated, the mother usually retains custody of the children and, if there is eligibility, full entitlement to the one-parent family payment. The scheme as it currently operates, therefore, may not sufficiently facilitate or promote joint parenting and to that extent may not be sufficiently father friendly.</P>
        <P>This is one of the issues being examined in a review of obstacles to employment faced by lone parents being carried out by a senior officials steering group which is due to report to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion by the end of July. Greater involvement of both parents in the rearing of their children is in the interests of all concerned and any changes to the social welfare system and, in particular, the one-parent family payment that may be needed to achieve that will be fully considered.</P>

        <Quest> the number of children awaiting <Col N="1700" />assessment for the cr&egrave;che supplement by a social worker or health sector personal social services professional in each county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>Cr&egrave;che supplements were introduced in some of the former health boards some years ago to provide individual assistance through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to parents wishing to use cr&egrave;ches. This arose, for example, where a parent would not be able to avail of necessary supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes without assistance towards the cost of child-minding.</P>
        <P>The fact that these supplements were in payment for extended periods in many cases indicated that they had become a long-term child care support rather than the short-term social welfare intervention which was originally intended. In effect, long-term child care needs were being provided through a short-term income support scheme.</P>
        <P>It is more appropriate that community operated or &ldquo;not-for-profit&rdquo; child care facilities in disadvantaged areas would be supported in a more direct and sustainable manner than indirectly through the short-term supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This approach has been successfully adopted in certain Health Service Executive areas where former health boards provided significant grant aid directly to community child care-cr&egrave;che facilities.</P>
        <P>More generally, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a significant financial support mechanism in place through its equal opportunities child care programme, particularly aimed at supporting parents who want to take up educational, training or employment opportunities. The Department of Education and Science also operates an Early Start pre-school programme aimed at children in the three to four year age range.</P>
        <P>The facilities supported directly through these mechanisms are able to provide child care facilities at low or no cost to disadvantaged families, who do not then have to rely on supplementary welfare allowance on an ongoing basis. Notwithstanding this, new cr&egrave;che supplements may be made available by the executive in specific instances where a public health nurse or health service social worker recommends that a child in difficult circumstances would benefit by attending a community cr&egrave;che, or that the parent or parents of a child needs to avail of counselling services, addiction treatments or similar and that cr&egrave;che services are required to facilitate this.</P>
        <P>In each such instance the executive must be satisfied that all the relevant circumstances are taken into account, for example, the person&rsquo;s ability to pay for or provide the service from an alternative source, in determining if a supplement is warranted in each case recommended by the professional worker involved. My Department has no responsibility for the health service professionals who refer people to community welfare <Col N="1701" />officers for consideration of a cr&egrave;che supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Accordingly, I do not have information on how many families or children are awaiting a professional assessment by public health nurses or health service social workers.</P>
        <P>However, my Department&rsquo;s computer system shows that there are currently 538 cr&egrave;che supplements in payment. Some 306 of these were awarded by community welfare officers following the issue of the guidelines by my Department to the Health Service Executive at the end of January last setting out the new provisions. According to computer records only 16 cr&egrave;che supplement applicants are awaiting a decision at present.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the community welfare service is in a position to deal with any referrals from public health nurses or social workers as the cases arise.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The construction federation operatives pension scheme is constituted as a registered employment agreement under the Industrial Relations Act 1946. The agreement was put in place in 1969 and it requires employers in the industry to provide specific pension benefits for their direct employees.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for various aspects of the scheme is divided between a number of agencies, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Labour Court, the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency and the <Col N="1702" />Pensions Board. The issues associated with this scheme are many and complex and anyone familiar with the scheme will accept that there are serious problems to be addressed. Employers are not registering for the scheme; where they are registered, in many cases, they are not paying contributions for all their employees and, in some cases, deductions are being made and are not being remitted to the scheme trustees. With regard to the latter, failure to remit deducted contributions is an offence under the Pensions Act and the Pensions Board investigates any cases brought to its attention.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Pensions Board are aware of the problems with the scheme and, while many of the problems are not within its remit, the Pensions Board has facilitated an examination of the situation by Mercer Consultants. The brief for this exercise covers, among other things, identifying the areas of non-compliance and making recommendations on methods of addressing these problems which are likely to be successful in achieving the scheme&rsquo;s objective.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Mercer report will be completed shortly and it will be examined in detail thereafter by all concerned with a view to implementation, as appropriate. SIPTU, in a recent meeting with me, put forward proposals on the compulsory deduction of contributions and these are being considered in the context of the review.</P>
        <P>Only contractors who are fully compliant in respect of their pensions and benefits obligations should be awarded public sector contracts. In this regard, I have been in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ask him to ensure that guidelines on public sector procurement relating to compliance with the construction industry scheme are observed by contracting authorities.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>I understand that the Deputy is concerned in particular about the current arrangements applying in the case of old age pension where a landholder leases land or is otherwise in possession of land which is lying fallow or idle.</P>
        <P>Where land is let on short-term lettings such as the 11-month system, the income from such lettings is calculated as cash income for the purpose of the means assessment for old age pension. Necessary expenses incurred by the owner, such as auctioneer fees, fencing or fertilising between lettings are deducted from the gross letting income.</P>
        <P>Where land is lying fallow or idle, there are two options for the assessment of means. If the Department is satisfied that the pension claimant <Col N="1703" />is depriving himself or herself of an income in order to qualify for a pension, or a pension at a higher rate than would otherwise be the case, the relevant assessment is the income which would be received if the land was let; where the Department is satisfied that this is not the case, the value of the land is obtained from the Valuation Office and is assessed as capital for means purposes.</P>
        <P>While there are no immediate plans to change the present arrangements in this regard, I have in recent times indicated that I am examining the distinction that exists between contributory and non-contributory pensions as regards earning entitlements and means testing as part of overall reforms in the pensions area.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The C45 system is the term used commonly in referring to the collection of income tax by the Revenue Commissioners through the relevant contracts tax or RCT system. It applies when payments are made by a principal contractor to a sub-contractor in respect of &ldquo;relevant operations&rdquo; in the construction industry, the meat processing industry and certain areas in the forestry industry. Tax is deducted by a principal contractor on payment to a sub-contractor, unless the principal contractor has received a relevant payments card for a sub-contractor who is registered with the Revenue Commissioners and holds a C2 card accordingly.</P>
        <P>Where tax is deducted, the principal contractor gives the sub-contractor a certificate &mdash; previously a form C45, now replaced by a form RCTDC &mdash; which the sub-contractor uses to claim credit for or repayment of the tax. Social insurance contributions continue to be collected through the self-assessment system. As this system operates as part of the tax collection system, data on the numbers working sectors under these arrangements are not available in my Department.</P>
        <P>This system of tax collection only operates where the principal contractor and the sub-contractor have signed a declaration agreeing that the contract is not a contract of employment, that is, that an employer-employee relationship does <Col N="1704" />not exist. Whether a person is working as an employee or in a self-employed capacity is determined by reference to a range of objective criteria which arise from case law. These criteria are outlined in the information leaflet Employed or Self-Employed &mdash; a guide to Tax and Social Insurance, which is published jointly by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department, as well as in the guides on relevant contract tax published by the Revenue Commissioners. A worker who is unsure of his or her employment status, or a representative such as a trade union, may request a formal determination from Scope section in my Department of the nature of the contract.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers using the RCTDC, in common with other self-employed workers, are compulsorily insured under the Social Welfare Acts at PRSI class S. Subject to an adequate insurance record, they are eligible for the following payments: widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension, orphan&rsquo;s contributory allowance, old age contributory pension, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, bereavement grant.</P>
        <P>Contributions paid by self-employed persons at PRSI class S are not reckonable for any short-term benefits including dental or optical benefits. To extend the range of benefits payable would mean an appreciable increase in the rate of contributions and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>My Department, in common with the other Departments involved, has produced an outline sectoral plan. This plan was published in September 2004 at the launch of the national disability strategy which included the publication of the Disability Bill 2004 and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
        <P>The objective of my Department&rsquo;s plan is to ensure that, as far as is practicable, the schemes and services provided to people with disabilities operate in a manner which facilitates their full participation in society and meets the mainstreaming principle of the equality agenda. The plan provides the framework for progressing and developing services to customers. It gives a brief description of the range of schemes and services available to people with disabilities and covers a wide range of issues including performance standards, supports for people returning to work or <Col N="1705" />education, proactive consultative processes to seek the views of people with disabilities, physical access to departmental premises, specific measures for visually or hearing impaired customers. It also describes the role of Comhairle in meeting the needs of people with disabilities, including the new personal advocacy service to be provided under the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004. It was published in outline form in order to allow a period of consultation and discussion with relevant interested persons or groups before the plan is finalised and laid before the D&aacute;il for approval.</P>
        <P>The consultation process involves two major initiatives, the first of which has just been completed. It involved four regional briefings facilitated by the National Disability Authority and was designed to provide information on the contents of the plan and to seek informed feedback. The target audiences for the briefings were people with disabilities, carers, advocates, family members and friends, service providers and the general public. A report on the outputs from the four briefings is being compiled by the National Disability Authority.</P>
        <P>The second initiative involves using the existing opportunities we have in place in my Department to get feedback and views from our customers with disabilities. We propose to seek feedback on our outline plan through the disability consultative forum which has been in operation since 1996. This forum comprises representatives of the principal disability organisations and service providers and meets on a quarterly basis. It acts as a channel to communicate the views of the relevant organisations to the Department and makes recommendations which can impact on policy formulation.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that, when finalised, the sectoral plan will provide a focus for the future development of services, provided by my Department, for people with disabilities and will include regular reporting on activities and improvements planned for the future. Production of sectoral plans is a matter for individual Departments. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has overall responsibility regarding the Disability Bill.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 371 together.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the ESRI report, Disability and Social Inclusion in Ireland, that the barriers faced by people with disabilities and, indeed, other groups who are vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion, are multi-faceted and require a multi-agency response. The National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005 sets out the framework for the Government&rsquo;s response to these problems. The current plan sets out the range of policies and programmes, such as income and employment supports, health and education, which are being undertaken by relevant Departments aimed at reducing or eliminating poverty and social exclusion.</P>
        <P>The national action plan specifically targets people with disabilities as one of a number of groups who are particularly vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion. The overall aim for people with disabilities is to increase their participation in work and society generally and to assist them and their families to lead full and independent lives. The plan details specific targets and actions which include rehabilitative training provision and skills development; increased participation in third level education; specific employment supports for people with disabilities and employers; access to health care; and care of people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The office for social inclusion, OSI, which is based in my Department, has overall responsibility for developing, co-ordinating and driving the national action plan. The OSI is currently completing a comprehensive review of progress against the targets contained in the current plan and a progress report will be submitted to the EU by the end of this month.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to continuing efforts to alleviate poverty, especially for those who have not been in a position to benefit from the employment opportunities afforded by high economic growth. During the period 2001 to 2005, there were substantial real increases in social welfare rates, with the lowest rates increasing by 40% while the consumer price index <Col N="1707" />increased by just over 13%. As a result of budget 2005, social welfare payments have increased by three times the expected rate of inflation. Government policy is to increase the level of social welfare over the period to 2007 and this commitment will be delivered. This will benefit all social welfare recipients, including those in receipt of disability payments.</P>

        <P>The introduction of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities is provided for in the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 which was published last September in conjunction with the Disability Bill 2004. The Bill aims to confer additional and enhanced functions on Comhairle, the national information agency, which will enable it to introduce a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The new service will provide for the assignment of a personal advocate to assist, support and represent a person with a disability in applying for and obtaining social services and also in pursuing any right of review or appeal in connection with those services. As announced in this year&rsquo;s budget package, additional funding of &euro;1 million has been provided to Comhairle to enable the groundwork to commence on the introduction of the new service. It is envisaged that the new personal advocacy service will be introduced in early 2008.</P>

        <P>Diet supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Any person receiving a social welfare or health service executive payment, who has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and who is unable to <Col N="1708" />provide for his or her food needs from within his or her own resources, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Diet supplements are subject to a means test. Under the existing scheme, the amount of supplement payable in individual cases depends on which of two categories of diet &mdash; low cost or high cost &mdash; has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical adviser and the household income.</P>
        <P>To inform a re-appraisal of the scheme, my Department commissioned a study by an expert from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. The study examined the special diets prescribed in legislation for which assistance is available through the existing diet supplement scheme. The study also considered the appropriate level of assistance required to cater for any additional costs involved in providing for necessary special diets, relative to the cost of a normal healthy eating diet.</P>
        <P>The findings of this research study have been assessed by my Department to determine how the diet supplement scheme should be developed. Development of a new scheme is complex, as the report points out that certain diet conditions covered under the existing scheme should be adjusted to reflect the latest medical and dietary thinking and the fact that more healthy food products are now widely available.</P>
        <P>I intend to introduce regulations shortly to update the scheme as appropriate, taking account of the study findings. In finalising the revised scheme and regulations, I want to make sure that any new supplement coverage and payment rates put in place continue to enable people on low incomes to meet the identified extra cost of the recommended special diets need. In the meantime, diet supplements continue to be provided for existing recipients and new applicants as heretofore.</P>

This outlined local and national data in describing the impact of alcohol misuse on the region. The report contains a number of recommendations aimed at reducing alcohol related harm.

        <P>There is a high degree of co-operation between the health administrations, North and South. For many years, regular meetings at ministerial, secretary general and official levels have afforded the opportunity to exchange information on issues of mutual interest and to discuss policy developments in our respective administrations.</P>
        <P>With the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council, the health agenda became formalised when five areas were designated for health co-operation. As the Deputy will be aware, the areas are accident and emergency services, planning for major emergencies, cancer research, high technology equipment and health promotion. Although the council has not been meeting since the suspension of devolved government in Northern Ireland, North-South contacts continue in these areas and steady progress continues to be made.</P>
        <P>So far as ministerial contact is concerned, I look forward to my first meeting with my counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Shaun Woodward, on 5 July, in Dublin, when we plan to discuss a number of areas of mutual interest. Mr. Woodward has expressed a particular interest in our tobacco control measures in the South and I intend to raise a number of cross-Border services issues with him where I feel that there are possibilities for cross-Border working.</P>
        <P>At secretary general level, there has been a long tradition of meetings once or twice a year. The most recent of these was on 1 February this year. This practice has operated very successfully as both an initiating and a consolidating influence on health relations North and South in the broad sense.</P>
        <Col N="1711" />
        <P>Under an initiative emanating from the North-South Ministerial Council on obstacles to cross-Border mobility, officials of my Department and of its counterpart, the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, established a working group to examine ways and means of addressing perceived obstacles to mutual recognition of qualifications in the medical profession. The working group has sought input to its deliberations from both the professional and regulatory bodies and from major employers of health staff. The group is nearing the completion of its remit and I look forward to its conclusions.</P>
        <P>Apart from the involvement of the two Departments, a most valuable asset is available to us for active cross-Border co-operation at the local level. This is Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, which is representative of the health authorities, North and South, in the Border area. Its aim is to improve the health and social well being of the population in this area and it has long been appreciated for its work and achievements in this role.</P>
        <P>This is a snapshot of cross-Border health relations at the present time. In accordance with a decision by the Government at the end of May, there will be a continued emphasis on North-South issues for the remainder of this year. Many Departments, including my own, have a number of key objectives of North-South co-operation to pursue in 2005 and I will ensure that the necessary momentum is maintained.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 123, 125 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will be aware that I decided, on balance, recently not to trigger risk equalisation payments in the health insurance market at this point in time. I reaffirm, however, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to recourse to risk equalisation as an essential support to maintaining the common good principle of community rating in our voluntary health insurance market and its recognition that provision for the operation of risk equalisation is concomitant to the policy of a community rated health insurance market.</P>
        <P>Risk equalisation is a process that aims to equitably neutralise differences in insurers&rsquo; costs that arise due to variations in the health status of their members. Depending on the extent of the variation, risk equalisation may result in cash transfers from insurers with lower risk members to insurers with higher risk members. EU Council Directive 92/49/EEC, the third non-life insurance directive, allows for specific legal provisions to be adopted in the interests of the common good in the field of voluntary private health insurance, including measures relating to risk equalisation between insurers. When the regulatory framework was being developed, the EU internal market directorate general determined that Ireland was entitled to adopt such provisions to protect the common good, including community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and risk equalisation, subject to the principles of necessity and proportionality.</P>
        <P>Both the principle and detail of providing for risk equalisation in the Irish voluntary health insurance market have been the subject of widespread consultation, analysis and extensive examination over a number of years. In addition to consultations carried out by my Department in the matter, the process has involved assessment of the issue by authoritative independent bodies, both nationally and internationally, and by EU Commission services.</P>
        <Col N="1715" />
        <P>Recourse to risk equalisation has been, and is, a feature of the market since enactment of the Health Insurance Act 1994. The original 1996 risk equalisation scheme was signed into law in March 1996. It was revoked in 1998 in the context of the preparation of a White Paper on private health insurance and in the clear understanding that it would be replaced. Following widespread public consultation the 2001 Health Insurance (Amendment) Act amended the risk equalisation provisions contained in the 1994 Act, principally, as follows: the enhancement of the role of the independent Health Insurance Authority and revision of the criteria by which risk equalisation would have been triggered &mdash; under the previous scheme an automatic triggering applied when the market equalisation percentage exceeded 2%.</P>
        <P>In January 2003, the Irish authorities formally notified the EU Commission of the scheme now in place. The Commission notified the Irish authorities in May 2003 that it had decided not to raise objections to the scheme on state aid grounds. This decision is being appealed by BUPA to the Court of First Instance.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the health insurance Acts provide that in considering whether risk equalisation transfers are warranted, the best overall interests of health insurance consumers include a reference to the need to maintain the application of community rating across the market for health insurance and to facilitate competition between undertakings. Any decision on the commencement of risk equalisation will not, therefore, be taken by reference to the specific insurance undertakings. The position regarding new entrants to the market is that they enjoy a three year exemption from risk equalisation payments. In addition, any liability in the fourth year is limited to 50% of that which would have been due in the normal course. It is not accepted that risk equalisation, if introduced, would be either unfair or unjust.</P>

        <P>The Government has agreed the <Col N="1719" />key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges. All those who were illegally charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not provide for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years ago. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the CPI, since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas in the autumn to underpin the scheme. One of the objectives of the legislation will be to put in place procedures which will protect vulnerable people from exploitation given that significant repayments in some cases will be paid to them. In the case of those who were charged and are still alive, the repayments will be exempt from tax and will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits. The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates.</P>
        <P>An outside company with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged to design and manage the scheme within the parameters of the key principles approved by Government. The Health Services Executive is finalising an advertisement in the <i>Official Journal</i> to obtain expressions of interest from companies that would design and manage the repayments scheme. The company selected will work closely with the HSE to ensure that the co-operation is forthcoming on records held by the health agencies. It is anticipated that a company will be selected over the summer and will begin work in early autumn on the design of the scheme.</P>
        <P>An oversight committee has been appointed by the T&aacute;naiste to monitor the implementation of the repayment scheme. The committee will be chaired by Dr. Bernard Walsh, a geriatrician in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, and its task will be to ensure that proper governance is applied by the HSE and the company to the scheme.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified under the <i>ex gratia </i>payments process. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process. The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund one-off <Col N="1720" />service improvements in elderly, mental health and disability services.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that about 20,000 people who are still alive and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates will benefit. It is estimated that the scheme will cost approximately &euro;1 billion. The decision to limit payments to the estates of those who died in the past six years reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgment to the Statute of Limitations.</P>
        <P>The national helpline set up by the Health Services Executive to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme.</P>
        <P>Any person who considers that he or she or a family member may be eligible for repayment may register their interest in advance with the Health Service Executive, by writing to the National Refund Scheme, HSE Midland Area, Arden Road, Tullamore, County Offaly; or e.mail to <i>refundscheme@mailq.hse.ie;</i> or by calling the helpline 1800 777737 during office hours.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The total number of persons covered by a medical card in June 2004 was 1,154,411. In the 12 month period the reduction in medical card coverage was 0.6%. This is mainly attributable to increases in household incomes and the management of the medical card databases. In January, income guidelines and allowances for dependants were increased across the board by a minimum of 7.5%. Within the past week, fundamental reform of the income assessment process has been agreed and published.</P>
        <P>Applications for medical cards and GP visit cards will be assessed on the disposable income of the applicant or spouse, and the reasonable expenses of child care, rent or mortgage and the costs of commuting to work will also be allowed. These significant improvements are aimed at ensuring that 1.378 million persons will be entitled to medical cards and GP visit cards by the end of 2005.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 to 130, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Details of the number of admissions to Irish psychiatric units and psychiatric hospitals for alcoholic disorders are contained in the Activities of Irish Psychiatric Services from the Health Research Board. The most recent report is for 2003. The data show that 258 persons under the age of 25, representing 12% of all admissions, were admitted as a result of alcoholic disorders in 2003.</P>
        <P>The hospital inpatient inquiry or HIPE system is the principal source of national data on discharges from acute hospitals in Ireland. The HIPE system records the clinical condition chiefly responsible for the patient&rsquo;s admission to hospital care. Excessive consumption of alcohol can be a strong contributory factor in a wide variety of medical and psychiatric conditions which themselves can be a reason for admission to hospital. It is not possible to identify in many cases whether excessive alcohol consumption may be the underlying cause of admission.</P>
        <P>The results of the alcohol and injuries study commissioned by the health promotion unit of my Department are expected to be available in the coming months. The purpose of the study was to establish the extent of alcohol related problems in the accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals. The study is expected to provide further evidence of the incidence of alcohol abuse and resultant attendance at accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>Following on a separate study by the HSE eastern region, measures have been identified to reduce and eliminate inappropriate presentations at accident and emergency departments by those with alcohol problems and provide more effective and responsive services to clients. These measures include establishing a targeted response to people with alcohol problems, both underlying and explicit, who present at accident and emergency departments. Currently, many accident and emergency departments do not have the capacity or processes to respond to the alcohol issues underlying many of the presentations. The HSE eastern region is setting up a pilot project in Dublin to put these measures in place to address the needs of patients and monitor their effectiveness.</P>

        <P>I have been concerned for some time about the adequacy of <Col N="1724" />services for victims of alleged sexual crime. I have therefore established a multi-disciplinary group under the chairmanship of a senior official of my Department to examine the co-ordination and delivery of services to adult and teenage victims of alleged sexual crime, determine the model of optimum delivery of service, and present its findings to me and the national steering committee on violence against women. This group is representative of service providers, voluntary organisations, the Garda, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the HSE. I expect to have a report from the group shortly which will inform any decisions regarding the extension of existing sexual assault treatment services nationally.</P>

The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that the remaining 120 beds or places will come on stream during 2005. In addition, extra beds will be provided in the new acute medical units which I announced as part of the accident and emergency services package on the publication of the Estimates for 2005.</P>

        <P>Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, published in November 2001, provided a blueprint to guide planning and activity in the health system over the next seven to ten years. A key objective of the strategy is the training and recruitment of health professionals for the development and expansion of health services.</P>
        <P>Action 101 of the strategy stated that the extra number of required staff for the health service would be recruited and that specifically, 10,000 nurses would be trained during the lifetime of the strategy. This target will be met. The Government has invested significantly in the training of nurses. The four-year nursing undergraduate degree programme started in 2002. Capital fund<Col N="1725" />ing of &euro;240 million has been provided for 13 new schools of nursing in the universities and institutes of technology. Revenue funding of &euro;90 million per annum will be required on an ongoing basis as the programme reaches full complement. Since 2002 there have been 1,640 student places available each year, an increase of 70% on the 1998 figure. By the end of 2005 there will be over 6,000 students at various stages of the nursing degree programme.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of additional staff for the expansion of existing services and the development of new services has been ongoing since the publication of the strategy. In December 2001 there were 31,426 whole time equivalent nurses employed in the public health service. By the end of December 2004 this figure had reached 34,313, an increase of 2,887 nurses in the first three years of the strategy. Further increases in the number of nurses employed will be considered in the context of new service developments.</P>

        <P>The health strategy document Quality and Fairness: a Health System for You stated that there would be substantial increases in the number of consultant posts. The number and location of these posts would later be determined by taking account of the recommendations of the national task force on medical staffing. Its report was published in 2003 and recommended that in order to meet the hospital medical staffing requirements arising from the implementation of the European working time directive, approximately 3,100 consultants should be employed by 2009 and 3,600 by 2013.</P>
        <P>To date, 513 additional consultant posts have been created since 2000. This represents a significant increase compared with the previous five years when an additional 224 posts were approved. The provision of additional consultant posts will be progressed within the context of the restructuring of the acute hospital services and the negotiation of a new contract for hospital consultants.</P>

        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health <Col N="1726" />Act 2004. The HSE has placed advertisements providing details of the application process in the national press and intends to place further advertisements in the regional press over the coming week.</P>
        <P>Those people whom the HSE deem eligible for GP visit cards will be able to visit their general practitioner without charge, and receive general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme from the date of approval of the card. Eligibility to GP visit cards will be determined by the Health Service Executive following an assessment of the income of the applicant, and spouse, if any, after tax and PRSI have been deducted. Provision for the allowance of reasonable expenses in respect of child care, rent or mortgage and commuting to work expenses has also been included.</P>

        <P>Preliminary talks were held in 2003 between management and the medical organisations to discuss the commencement of negotiations on a new contract for hospital consultants. Unfortunately, the opposition of these organisations to the extension of the clinical indemnity scheme to cover claims against consultants led to a decision by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, not to participate in further negotiations pending a resolution of the issues involved. This resulted in the commencement of talks on a new contract having to be deferred.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the substantive difficulties which consultants had with the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme have now been dealt with. The Government has also given a commitment to defend the interests of consultants left without assistance by the MDU. I am confident that the medical organisations will re-enter negotiations with the Health Service Executive on a new contract for hospital consultants at an early date.</P>

        <TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
        <P>The health strategy, entitled Quality and Fairness, acknowledged the central role of primary care in a modern health service. In recognition of this central focus on primary care services a separate strategy document, entitled Primary Care: A New Direction, was published in November 2001. The strategy sets out the Government&rsquo;s vision for integrated team based primary care services and provides a template for their development over a period of ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P>Following the launch of the strategy a small task force was established in my Department to give an initial impetus to implementation. My Department continues to drive the implementation of the primary care strategy and to develop policy in this regard. The implementation process is overseen by the national primary care steering group, which is representative of the broad range of stakeholders, and considerable work has been undertaken by the former health boards to advance implementation.</P>
        <P>There are three broad approaches required to enable the primary care strategy to be implemented. These are: revenue and capital investment by the State to deliver additional services in primary care; the substantial reorganisation of the resources already within the health services; and a structured role for the private sector in the development of facilities and possibly also the delivery of services.</P>
        <P>An initial ten primary care teams have been developed, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented with additional health professionals. These teams are intended to demonstrate the primary care model in action and also to enable practical experience to be gained of the process involved in developing a primary care team and providing an expanded range of services.</P>
        <P>Work has already been undertaken by the former health boards to map out the proposed numbers, locations and configurations of future primary care teams and networks and the resource requirements associated with these. The Health Service Executive must complete this task to provide a firm basis for the future organisation of resources within the new unified health delivery system of the Health Service Executive, and incorporating the significant numbers of staff and contractors already involved in the delivery of primary care services.</P>
        <P>The Government has supported the development of out of hours co-operatives to provide the benefits of reliable out of hours services to the public. Between 2000 and 2004, a total of &euro;72.882 million was allocated to the former health boards for out of hours co-operatives nationally and, in 2005, &euro;31.98 million has been included in the baseline funding to the Health Service Executive, which includes &euro;6.5 million of additional funding.</P>
        <P>In 2005, an additional &euro;5 million in revenue funding has been provided to support the imple<Col N="1728" />mentation of the strategy, bringing total ongoing additional revenue funding to &euro;12 million per annum. To date, capital funding of &euro;2.725 million and a further &euro;1.8 million in respect of information and communications technology supports have been provided to facilitate the provision of appropriate facilities and ICT supports for the initial primary care teams.</P>
        <P>Work is almost complete on a strategy and action plan on information and communications technology, ICT, for primary care. This will provide a basis for the development of ICT systems which support interdisciplinary primary care and which also facilitate the delivery of care in an integrated way across all sectors within the health service.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the existing network of community health centres and general practice premises is not adequate to meet the needs of primary care teams. To ensure that appropriate facilities are developed on the required scale, resources other than those of the Exchequer will be required and, indeed, this is in line with the historic practice, whereby there has been a mix of public and private facilities provision with, for example, general practitioners in many cases funding their own practice premises. In this regard, the strategy emphasises the need to gain full benefit from existing buildings and to fully explore opportunities for private investment and public private partnerships in implementing the development programme.</P>
        <P>Many primary care services are already delivered by private and non-State contractors. I am committed to developing policy which will stimulate private sector investment in developing facilities and services and also support much enhanced collaborative working between the public and private sectors. My Department is considering how this agenda can be advanced so as to harness the undoubted potential within the non-State sector and so enable and support the delivery of integrated primary care services in line with national policy.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
        <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 139 to 142, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The individual referred to by the Deputy first contacted the Department of Health and Children about her care and treatment in a private psychiatric hospital and about access to her medical records. On investigation it was found that the private hospital involved had closed in 1996 and the Department was informed that the medical records had been destroyed. The individual was so advised. The Deputy was informed of the identity of the former owner and administrator of the hospital by the Tan&aacute;iste in correspondence dated 31 May 2004.</P>
        <P>The investigation of alleged professional misconduct of a medical practitioner is a matter for consideration by the Medical Council. Therefore, the individual&rsquo;s complaint about a medical practitioner was not a matter which could have been pursued by the former inspector of mental hospitals or the Department. The Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. Furthermore, the Department of Health and Children has no function concerning records, or the amending of records, held by the Medical Council. The individual referred to by the Deputy has been so informed many times.</P>
        <P>On foot of a request for a meeting with him, the then Secretary General wrote to the individual involved on 31 October 2003 and strongly recommended that she make contact with the then inspector of mental hospitals who was available to meet with her. This contact did not happen.</P>
        <P>It is regretted that it has not been possible to resolve matters to the individual&rsquo;s satisfaction. However, I am satisfied that everything possible has been done to assist and that her complaints have been addressed in so far as possible by the Department. The Department now considers the matter closed and the individual has been so informed.</P>

        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to infectious diseases screening for asylum seekers. Since May 2000, screening in respect of specific infectious diseases has been offered to asylum seekers on a voluntary and confidential basis, free of charge, shortly after their arrival in this country. The purpose of screening is to detect and treat certain infectious diseases in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves and their families, as well as the community in general.</P>
        <P>Initial screening usually takes place in Dublin where asylum seekers may reside following arrival in this country and continues when they are relocated to other HSE regions. Those who do not receive screening in Dublin are offered this service following relocation. The guidelines relating to infectious disease screening recommend screening is provided for the following diseases: TB, hepatitis B and, where appropriate, HIV, polio and <i>varicella zoster</i> or chicken pox.</P>
        <P>In the time available, it has not been possible to establish the precise screening regimes in other EU jurisdictions. However, in so far as my Department is aware, our screening policy is broadly in line with that in other EU member states.</P>

        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. The HSE has placed advertise<Col N="1734" />ments providing details of the application process in the national press and intends to place further advertisements in the regional press over the coming week.</P>
        <P>The determination of eligibility of applications for medical cards is statutorily vested in the HSE. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer, or a delegated officer, will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant and spouse, if any. Recent changes introduced by the HSE will mean that household income, after deductions in respect of PRSI and tax have been made, will be assessed when determining eligibility. Also provision will be made for reasonable expenses in respect of child care, rent or mortgage and commuting to work expenses.</P>
        <P>Medical cards may be made available by the HSE where guidelines are exceeded in circumstances, for example, where there is particular need for medical services. A medical card may be issued to all or some members of a family. However, in all cases, the decision is a matter for the HSE. In assessing a person&rsquo;s eligibility, every aspect of an individual&rsquo;s financial means and medical expenses are carefully examined to ensure that no financial hardship is caused by the executive&rsquo;s refusal to grant a medical card in any particular case. Those people whom the HSE deems to be eligible for GP cards will be able to visit their general practitioner without charge and receive general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the income guidelines used by the HSE for the purpose of assessment of medical card applications were increased from 1 January 2005 by 7.5%. The income guidelines to be used to assess applications for GP visit cards will be up to a further 25% higher than those for assessing full medical card eligibility.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges. All those who were illegally charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The repayment will apply to all those who were illegally charged, including those in receipt of payments other than the non-contributory old age pension. The scheme will not provide for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years ago. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the CPI, since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas in the autumn to underpin the scheme. One of the objectives of the legislation will be to put in place procedures which will protect vulnerable people from exploitation given that significant repayments in some cases will be paid to them.</P>
        <P>An outside company with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged to design and <Col N="1738" />manage the scheme within the parameters of the key principles approved by Government. The Health Services Executive is finalising an advertisement in the <i>Official Journal </i> to obtain expressions of interest from companies that would design and manage the repayments scheme. The company selected will work closely with the HSE to ensure that co-operation is forthcoming on records held by the health agencies. It is anticipated that a company will be selected over the summer and will begin work in early autumn on the design of the scheme.</P>
        <P>I have appointed an oversight committee to monitor the implementation of the repayment scheme. The committee will be chaired by Dr. Bernard Walsh, a geriatrician in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, and its task will be to ensure that proper governance is applied by the HSE and the company to the scheme.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified under the <i>ex gratia</i> payments process. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>
        <P>The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund one-off service improvements in elderly, mental health and disability services.</P>
        <P>The national helpline set up by the Health Services Executive to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme. Any person who considers that they or a family member may be eligible for repayment may register their interest in advance with the Health Service Executive, by writing to the National Refund Scheme, HSE Midland Area, Arden Road, Tullamore, County Offaly, or e-mail to <i>refundscheme@mailq.hse.ie</i> or by calling the helpline 1800 777737 during office hours.</P>

        <P>The domiciliary care allowance or DCA was introduced in 1973 by way of circular 24/73 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act 1970. The DCA is a monthly allowance administered by Health Service Executive areas and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 years who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year.</P>
        <P>Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to a means test. While no condition is debarred, conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not normally considered unless there is a very high degree of additional care and attention required. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer or other designated medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether a child qualifies for DCA on medical grounds.</P>
        <P>Since the allowance is intended as a recognition of the additional burden involved in caring for children with a severe disability in the child&rsquo;s home, it does not apply to children who are maintained full-time in residential homes, schools or other institutions. Eligible children in part-time residential care who go home at weekends or holidays may receive a <i>pro rata</i> payment, that is, a nightly rate based on the number of nights spent at home. The nightly rate is equal to the monthly rate multiplied by 12 and divided by 365.</P>
        <P>However, the allowance is paid in full in cases where eligible children who live full-time at home are absent for a period or periods of not more than eight weeks in any 12 month period, that is, hospital admissions or respite.</P>

        <Quest>if she will accept a ban on the use of all non-human primates and dogs and cats in animal experiments here, regardless if whether they are used in regulatory toxicology in Ireland; the institutions at which they are used; the number of animals of each species which are used every year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <P>While it is not the practice in Ireland to license experiments involving the use of primates, there are no plans at present to introduce legislation in this regard. I have arranged to make the 1999 and 2002 statistics on the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes available to the Deputy; these include data on cats and dogs used in toxicological and other safety evaluations. The 2002 statistics are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dohc.ie</i>. These statistics are compiled in accordance with the requirements of the European Commission. Information on individual licence applications relating to experimental animals held at specific registered premises is provided in confidence and is treated as such by my Department.</P>
        <P>The use of live animals in scientific research and other experimental activity is strictly controlled in accordance with the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876) Regulations 2002. The Act, as <Col N="1741" />amended, gives full effect to European Council Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of experimental animals and ensures that Ireland is fully in line with European standards for the welfare of experimental animals. One of the objectives of the directive is to reduce the numbers of animals used for experiments by encouraging the development and the validation of alternative methods to replace animal methods. The Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that an experiment shall not be performed if another scientifically satisfactory method of obtaining the result sought, not entailing the use of an animal, is reasonably and practicably available.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has established the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods, ECVAM, to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods which are of importance to the biosciences and which reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals. Ireland supports the work of ECVAM and is represented on its scientific committee.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
        <P>While three botulinum toxin medicinal products are authorised for marketing in Ireland, only one, botox, is produced and tested in Ireland. I am advised by the Irish Medicines Board that the only potency test currently available for defining the strength of botulinum toxin products is the LD50 test in mice; therefore, this test continues to be used. In regard to possible alternative tests, it is important to note that the development of any such test must, according to the European Pharmacopoeia, include validation, that is, experimental proof that any new test is equivalent to the LD50 test in terms of analytical performance. I am advised by the Irish Medicines <Col N="1742" />Board that manufacturers are conducting development studies of this nature but the outcome of these studies, which by their nature take a considerable length of time to complete, cannot be predicted.</P>
        <P>The use of live animals in scientific research and other experimental activity is strictly controlled in accordance with the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876) Regulations 2002. The Act, as amended, gives full effect to European Council Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of experimental animals and ensures that Ireland is fully in line with European standards for the welfare of experimental animals.

The Act provides,<i> inter alia</i>, that an experiment shall not be performed if another scientifically satisfactory method of obtaining the result sought, not entailing the use of an animal, is reasonably and practicably available.</P>
        <P>As part of the licence application process, applicants must indicate that the use of alternatives has been fully considered prior to applying for a licence. The experimental procedure for which a licence is being sought must be certified as being essential and that there is no alternative method reasonably and practicably available. This certification must be performed by two qualified persons of professorial standing, from a relevant scientific, medical or veterinary discipline.</P>
        <P>I have arranged to make the 1999 and 2002 statistics on the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes available to the Deputy. These include data on the use of the LD50 test. The 2002 statistics are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dohc.ie</i>.

        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in line with best international standards. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care to cancer patients. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in oncology services in the coming years.</P>
        <Col N="1743" />
        <P>The national cancer forum is currently finalising a new national cancer strategy. The strategy has been developed in consultation with the major stakeholders, professional and voluntary groups and the general public and will have regard to the multi-faceted aspects of cancer control. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations on a balanced organisation of cancer services nationally, with defined roles for hospitals in the delivery of cancer care. It is anticipated that this work will be completed in the autumn.</P>

        <P>Since June 2004, the Deputy has tabled 29 parliamentary questions concerned with matters which are properly the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, from I January 2005, and previously of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. It is the practice in my Department to forward such questions immediately to the agency concerned and to request that the matter be examined and a reply issued directly to the Deputy as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive recently established a parliamentary affairs division to act as a central contact for all Oireachtas requests relating to matters within its statutory remit. A key function of the division is to monitor, throughout the executive&rsquo;s national directorates and administrative areas, the timeliness of replies and to initiate any necessary follow up action relating to the issue of replies. In the time available, inquiries made by my Department indicate that replies have issued to the Deputy in most of the cases concerned and the remainder are currently being processed for the purpose of preparing replies. However, my Department has asked the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to ascertain the precise position in regard to the replies to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions and to write to him in the matter.</P>

        <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, which has statutory responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products for use in Ireland, has provided the following information regarding monosodium glutamate.</P>
        <P>Monosodium Glutamate is contained in the BCG vaccine SSI and amino acids &mdash; monosodium glutamate is an amino acid &mdash; are present in Priorix, MMR vaccine. Residues of monosodium glutamate may be present as part of the manufacturing process but a detailed review of the manufacturing file would be necessary to determine this. Nevertheless, I am advised that the amount of monosodium glutamate present in the vaccines, if detectable at all, would only be present in tiny amounts and the effect on obesity in children would be minimal.</P>
        <P>More generally, the national task force on obesity presented its report, Obesity &mdash; the Policy Challenges, to the Taoiseach on 16 May 2005. The report contains 93 recommendations. These relate to actions across six broad sectors: high level Government; education; social and com<Col N="1750" />munity; health; food commodities &mdash; production and supply; and the physical environment. The report highlights the need for &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; policy, cross-collaboration between all key stakeholders and real practical engagement by both the public and the private sectors.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, will shortly present the report to Cabinet.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
        <P>Monosodium glutamate, MSG, is a food additive whose main function is to enhance flavours. MSG is authorised for use in all member states of the European Union, including Ireland, under Directive No 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners, as amended, which has been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners) Regulations 2004, S.I. No. 58 of 2004.</P>
        <P>MSG was authorised following a rigorous safety assessment by the EU scientific committee on food, SCF. It has also been evaluated by other national and international food safety organisations, including the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation Expert Committee on Food Additives, JECFA, and by the US Food and Drug Administration. These organisations have not allocated MSG any acceptable daily intake, ADI. Normally, when a food additive is approved, an ADI is set but when, on the basis of the available scientific data, the total intake of the substance following consumption of a typical diet does not represent a hazard to health no ADI is specified. Against this background there is no basis for considering MSG to be dangerous or addictive and I have no proposals in regard to advising the public to reduce their MSG intake.</P>
        <P>No evidence of a connection between MSG and obesity was brought to the attention of the national task force on obesity and therefore its report, Obesity &mdash; the Policy Challenges, which was launched on 16 May 2005, makes no reference to this issue.</P>

        <P>The Department of Health and Children Vote for 2004, both current and capital, was &euro;8,664.272 million. The total surplus surrendered for the year was &euro;70.948 million. The amount of the surplus arising from the receipt of appropriations-in-aid, subhead K, in excess of the voted sum was &euro;60.761 million. Under public financial procedures, any sums received over and above the amount voted by the D&aacute;il for appropriations-in-aid must be surrendered at year end to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Of the remaining surplus of &euro;10.187 million, &euro;1.84 million was due to savings on administrative budget subheads as follows: subhead A5 &mdash; office machinery and other office supplies, &euro;0.85 million; and subhead A7 &mdash; consultancy services, &euro;0.99 million. Under the terms of the administrative budget agreement, savings in one year may be carried forward to the following year with Department of Finance approval, which was obtained.</P>
        <P>The residual surplus of &euro;8.347 million arose on the following subheads of the Department&rsquo;s Vote, due to timing issues in respect of a number of minor headings, including the cost of the hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal and payments to the State Claims Agency for the clinical indemnity scheme.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.</P>
        <P>Information on membership vacancies in statutory bodies where appointments are made by the Minister for Health and Children is shown in Table 1. However, the Deputy will wish to be aware in the context of the table that in some instances the relevant legislation may provide for <Col N="1764" />a maximum number of members rather than setting an exact numerical membership requirement. The information contained in the Table 1 takes into account the full membership potential of the body.</P>
        <P>The term of office of the most recent board of the postgraduate medical and dental board, PGMDB, expired in March 2002. The Prospectus report recommended that the PGMDB should be abolished and that its functions should be taken on by other bodies in the restructured health service. The Department, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and the Medical Council, is considering how best the functions of the PGMDB and other functions relating to medical education and training should be provided for in the future by the HSE. In relation to dental education and training, consultation with the Dental Council will also be undertaken. The abolition of the body and the transfer of its functions will be effected by the new medical practitioners Bill, which is being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel. The information requested by the Deputy in regard to expected vacancies is set out in Table 2.</P>
        <P>The process by which a person is appointed to a state board or body reflects the conditions for the appointment laid down in the relevant statutory instrument or Act. Nominations under the aegis of my Department can arise in different ways. Some members are nominated by prescribed bodies, individual office holders or organisations and others are appointed by the Minister for Health and Children, having due regard to the nature of the work of the body and the consequent requirement for any appointee to hold the necessary skills and expertise required to discharge the functions of that particular body. The time required to appoint members therefore varies. It is my intention, however, to fill vacancies in a timely manner.</P>

        <P>The Adoption Board considered the Adoption Law of Morocco at its meeting on 3 July 2001. The board decided on that date that adoptions effected in Morocco are not recognised under Irish law.</P>
        <P>Legislation is being prepared by Department of Health and Children to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993. The heads of the Bill have gone to the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is hoped the Bill will be published in early 2006. It will provide a framework within which Ireland, by establishing a system of co-operation with those countries who have ratified the 1993 Hague Convention or who operate within the spirit of the convention, may regulate the process of intercountry adoption. Morocco has not signed or ratified the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993.</P>

        <P>Following the publication of the Pollock report, which reviewed the existing <Col N="1766" />hospital services for person with cystic fibrosis, the Health Service Executive established a working group to examine cystic fibrosis services. The working group is multi-disciplinary in its composition and includes representation from the Cystic Fibrosis Association.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the working group is to review the current configuration and delivery of services to cystic fibrosis patients in the Republic of Ireland, across hospitals and the community, and to make recommendations for reconfiguration, improvement and development. The working group will consider the report prepared by Dr. Pollock on behalf of the Cystic Fibrosis Association in Ireland and will encompass aspects of service alluded to but not covered in depth in that report, including cystic fibrosis services delivered in the community, the cystic fibrosis register, training and development of clinical staff, cost structures, and cross-border arrangements.</P>
        <P>The group held its first meeting in early April and there have been three further meetings. I understand that it hopes to complete its work over the next few months. The work of the group will result in an agreed proposal for the development and reconfiguration of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive will have the responsibility for implementing and funding any recommendations made by the group. My Department will, therefore, request the executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to her query regarding the timetable for the finalisation of the Group&rsquo;s recommendations in the context of the 2006 Estimates.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on commencement of an SSIA account, the account holder had to certify that the following conditions would be satisfied for the duration of the scheme: the holder was over 18 years of age and resident in the State at commencement; the holder would operate only one SSIA; subscriptions to the account would only be made by the holder or his-her spouse and from his-her own resources; subscriptions to the account would not be funded by borrowing or the deferral of repayment, whether in respect of capital or interest, of amounts <Col N="1769" />already borrowed; and subscriptions to the account in each of the first 12 months would be of an amount, not less than &euro;12.50 and not more than &euro;254, agreed between the holder and the qualifying savings manager, financial institution, at the commencement of the account. For the remainder of the scheme, the only statutory restriction is that the maximum subscription in any month must not exceed &euro;254; funds held in an SSIA would not be used as security for a loan.</P>
        <P>Prior to the maturity of the SSIA, the account holder must complete a declaration confirming that for the duration of the scheme, s/he held only one SSIA; he or she is the person who beneficially owns the qualifying funds held in the account; he or she was resident or ordinarily resident in the State since commencement of the account; the account was funded from resources available him-her, or spouse, without recourse to borrowing or by the deferral of repayment, whether in respect of capital or interest, of sums already borrowed; and he or she did not sign or pledge funds held in the account as security for a loan.</P>
        <P>The first accounts are due to mature at the end of May 2006. Each financial institution will, at the appropriate time, circa 14 weeks prior to the maturity date, supply a maturity declaration to each SSIA holder for completion and return to the institution. The financial institution will mature the account at the appropriate time and pay over to Revenue the appropriate tax on the income earned by the account. The account holder can then either maintain and continue the account, without the benefit of the Exchequer top up, or withdraw funds as he or she wishes.</P>
        <P>In regard to further investment terms, the specific goal of the SSIA scheme was to encourage people to save over a period of at least five years. Its effect has been to stimulate such savings over varying income ranges which is evident in the extensive take-up by many low income earners. The scheme has been a success in those terms. The scheme has a specific duration. Any proposals for tax-based incentives for the continuation of savings would be considered as part of the normal annual budgetary process taking account of public policy objectives and Exchequer cost implications. The use to which the monies arising on maturity of the SSIAs are put is ultimately a matter for the individual account holder.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 250 together.</P>
        <P>A stamp duty exemption for first-time buyers of second hand houses under &euro;317,500 was brought in by budget 2005. Previously it had applied only to houses up to &euro;190,500, so the very significant increase in the threshold made this exemption relevant to a much broader range of purchasers. Reduced rates of duty were also made available for purchases up to &euro;635,000.</P>
        <P>The relief from stamp duty is intended to benefit only genuine first-time buyers. It is essential that the stamp duty advantage intended for first-time buyers should not be diluted by allowing persons who are not first-time buyers circumvent the rules, by borrowing in tandem with another person who is a first-time buyer.</P>
        <P>Revenue has always accepted that a person would not have been precluded from obtaining first-time buyer relief where a parent provides funds by means of an unconditional gift towards the purchase of a house or where a parent acts as financial guarantor in relation to purchase moneys which are borrowed by his or her son or daughter in connection with the purchase.</P>
        <P>In a statement issued on Friday last, 24 June 2005, the Revenue Commissioners have offered reassurance to first-time buyers in relation to situations involving parents of first-time buyers acting as co-mortgagors. The Revenue Commissioners are now prepared to accept that a child, who is a first-time buyer, will not be precluded from claiming first-time buyer relief where a parent acts as a co-mortgagor in the following circumstances: the transfer of the house is taken in the name of the child; it is the intention of both the child and the parent that the parent is not to take a beneficial interest in the house; the parent has been joined into the mortgage solely at the request of the lending institution for the purpose of providing additional security for the moneys being advanced for the purchase; it is not intended that the parent will be contributing to the repayment of the mortgage in the normal course.</P>
        <P>Where the four conditions set out above are satisfied, Revenue will treat the parent as effectively acting in the role of guarantor for the loan.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that the Revenue Commissioners do not propose to seek a clawback of stamp duty where transfers have taken place before last Friday which comply with the conditions outlined above.</P>

The number of live registrations in each category is as follows: principal contractors including principals that are also uncertified subcontractors &mdash; 15,998; certified subcontractors, i.e. have a C2 certificate &mdash; 22,056; principal contractors that are also certified subcontractors &mdash; 19,488; and uncertified subcontractors, i.e. do not have a C2 certificate &mdash; 58,862. The total number of live registrations is 116,404.</P>
        <P>A major programme of work has been undertaken by Revenue in recent years to upgrade the RCT computer systems to the standard available for other business taxes. RCT is now fully integrated into Revenue&rsquo;s integrated taxation systems and has recently been integrated into its case management system, which allows individual case management of cases with RCT tax debts. Using this case management system, Revenue caseworkers are now deploying the full range of collection and compliance activities against individuals and companies that are non-compliant or have arrears of RCT, as part of a whole case management approach.</P>
        <P>The final stage of the computer development programme for RCT is the development of management information systems and reports. These are expected to be available early next year. Until then Revenue is unable to provide authoritive data on overall amounts outstanding for each year.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available is in respect of income earners on tax records aged 65 years and over. On the basis of income tax returns received for 2002, the latest year for which the relevant data has been compiled, the available information is as follows: total numbers with a tax liability &mdash; 56,000; total amount of tax &mdash;&euro;403 million; average amount of tax &mdash;&euro;7,196, based on income earners aged 65 or over with a tax liability, &euro;2,702, based on all income earners aged 65 or over.</P>
        <P>Because of the Revenue Commissioners obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the highest figure for tax paid cannot be divulged due to the small numbers of income earners with significantly high tax payments. It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on taxation and the elderly is set out in An Agreed Programme for Government which refers to &ldquo;delivering further real improvements to pensioners and people on low incomes&rdquo;. This has been the guiding principle underlying the tax treatment of elderly persons, including those aged over 70, in recent budgets.</P>
        <P>The age exemption limits, under which those aged 65 or over are exempt from income tax up to specified limits, have been increased in every budget since 1997. In the last four budgets alone, the limits have increased by almost 53% which is well ahead of inflation. After budget 2005, they stand at &euro;16,500 per annum in the case of a single or widowed person and &euro;33,000 per annum in the case of a married couple where one spouse is or both spouses are aged 65 or over.</P>
        <P>Within available resources, the focus has been on assisting elderly persons on low incomes through annual increases in the age exemption limits. Such an approach is considered preferable to one where elderly income earners who reach a particular age threshold would be completely exempted from income tax regardless of their income. However, I point out to the Deputy that in the 2002 tax year the majority of income earners aged 65 or over on Revenue&rsquo;s records had no liability for tax.</P>

Accordingly, I do not propose to change the stamp duty code along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This represents an increase of 17.35% in contacts over 2004.</P>
        <P>All available resources during this period were concentrated primarily in dealing with the substantial increase in PAYE 1890 phone calls and callers to our public offices. The volume of unworked post reached its peak in mid April 2005.</P>
        <P>The reasons for the delays included a significant increase in economic activity in the Dublin region resulting in a sizable increase in the<?oasys _jy?>casebase, for example approximately 20,000 new PAYE registrations in the first six months of 2005; the 17.35% overall increase in contacts from PAYE taxpayers in the same period; the reduction in the time period for repayment claims from ten years to four years resulted in a significant increase in the number of claims and in the complexity of those claims; many claims were for a ten-year period; and greater awareness by taxpayers of their entitlements to tax credits and reliefs as a consequence of an intensive advertis<Col N="1775" />ing campaign by Revenue and other media coverage.</P>
        <P>Revenue inform me that through determined efforts by Dublin management and staff, the April backlog has now been substantially reduced and it is planned to have dealt with all the pre-July correspondence by 31 July. Management and staff have been working in full co-operation to clear the arrears. There have been no industrial relation problems during this period and staff shortages have not been an issue. Staff have in fact been working extremely long hours in a determined effort to clear the arrears and overtime has been made available where necessary.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 to 260, inclusive, and 274 together.</P>
        <P>Credit unions are regulated by the Registrar of Credit Unions within the financial regulator. They are regulated primarily in accordance with the Credit Union Act 1997.</P>
        <P>The decision to maintain a distinct regulatory structure for credit unions within the financial regulator was a deliberate one, designed to reflect their particular volunteer and community-based ethos. This ethos was already reflected in the Credit Union Act.</P>
        <P>The Credit Union Act lays down, not only prudential and consumer protection rules, but also the separate and distinct legal structure from which credit unions benefit. This includes the rules governing the conditions for registration as a credit union and the procedure for the appointment of boards of directors, supervisory committees, credit committees, credit control committees and membership committees.</P>
        <P>Oversight of the system laid down in the Act is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions, who occupies a statutory post within the financial regulator. The core function of the regis<Col N="1777" />trar is to take such action as appears necessary, within the terms of the legislation, to protect the savings of credit union members. In discharge of his duties, the registrar is free to issue to credit unions such guidelines as he considers desirable. The regulator also issues such guidelines to other sectors. Their general purpose is to provide advice and information regarding best practice to financial institutions. They are intended to support the continued development of an effective and efficient regulatory system that underpins the maintenance of financial stability and the protection of the consumer.</P>
        <P>The manner in which the registrar carries out his supervisory duties under the Credit Union Act, including any guidance notes that he chooses to issue or meetings he chooses to arrange, are solely matters for the registrar, subject to any directions or guidelines that the regulatory authority may issue to him. It is a matter for credit unions themselves to address any training requirements that might arise for officers and staff of credit unions.</P>
        <P>I am aware of views being expressed about the possible need for changes to the Credit Union Act to reflect the changing role of credit unions in present-day Irish society. Such views have been expressed by credit union representative bodies as well as by the registrar. I am also conscious of the demands that the credit union regulatory system can impose on volunteers and the need to ensure that the regulatory burden is proportionate to the objective of protecting the savings of credit union members. I am aware that the registrar has been consulting widely with a view to encouraging the maximum consensus on changes to the regulatory system. I have also asked the credit union advisory committee to advise me on the need for such change.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 263 together.</P>
        <Col N="1778" />
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that home carer tax credit is available in the case of a married couple who are jointly assessed to income tax where one spouse is a home carer. A &ldquo;home carer&rdquo; is a person who cares for one or more dependant persons.</P>
        <P>A dependant person for the purposes of the tax credit must be either a child for whom social welfare child benefit is payable, a person aged 65 years or over or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity. In addition, the dependant must reside either with the carer, on the same property as the carer or next door in a neighbouring residence to the carer or within 2 km of the carer.</P>
        <P>The home carer tax credit currently amounts to &euro;770 per annum. Where the home carer has some small income in his or her own right, the tax credit may still be due. The tax credit is due in full where the home carer&rsquo;s annual income does not exceed &euro;5,080 and where it exceeds that amount, the tax credit is reduced by half the excess, effectively a reduction of &euro;1 in the tax credit for every &euro;2 of income, so that where the annual income exceeds &euro;6,620 no tax credit is due. For example, if the income of the carer spouse is &euro;5,850, a reduced tax credit of &euro;385 applies. The income disregard was introduced to allow the home carer have a small income in his-her own right while retaining the tax credit. Also, the taper ensures that the credit is not lost all at once when income exceeds the amount of the disregard.</P>
        <P>While the carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit payable by the Department of Social and Family Affairs are regarded as income for taxation purposes, no account is taken of these payments in determining the home carer&rsquo;s entitlement to the home carer tax credit.</P>
        <P>In the case of a person who has left the workforce to care for seriously ill relatives and is in receipt of annual income in excess of &euro;6,620, excluding the carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the home carer tax credit is not due. Any changes to the home carer tax credit would be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual budget and Finance Bill.</P>

        <Quest>if, in relation to the capital allowance for hotels, a person had planning permission since December 2004 but due to difficulties with same, building has not commenced will still qualify for the capital allowance; the length of time the capital allowance is valid for; and if there will be an extension of the capital allowance for 2005.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>The Finance Act 2003 extended the write-off period for capital allowances for hotels from seven to 25 years. It provided that capital expenditure incurred on or after 4 December 2002 on the construction or refurbishment of a hotel is to be written off at the rate of 4% per annum over 25 years. However, certain transitional provisions ensured that where a full and valid planning application was received by a planning authority before 31 December 2004 in respect of hotel projects, capital expenditure incurred on such projects on or before 31 July 2006 could continue to be written off over a seven year period at the rate of 15% per annum for the first six years and 10% in year seven. Thus, in cases where these transitional planning requirements have been met, capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of a hotel can be written off over seven years where the expenditure in question represents work actually carried out on or before 31 July 2006. Expenditure incurred in respect of any work carried out after that date can be written off at 4% per annum over 25 years.</P>
        <P>I directed my Department, together with the Revenue Commissioners, and in conjunction with external consultants to undertake a detailed review in 2005 of various property incentive reliefs, including this relief in respect of hotels. I also stated in budget 2005 that the termination dates for these schemes as laid down previously in Finance Act 2004 remain unchanged. In this regard I am not considering making any changes to the scheme until this review has been completed.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>The position is that the charging of VAT on mobile telephone calls made and completed or initiated in another state is covered by section 5(5) of the Value Added Tax Act 1972, as amended, which transposes Article 9(1) of the sixth Council directive. This provides that VAT is charged in the place of establishment of the supplier.</P>
        <P>Therefore, Irish suppliers of mobile phone services are liable to account for VAT on services provided to business and private customers, established or resident in the State, for their usage of those services anywhere in the world. Accordingly, the charging of VAT on mobile telephone calls made and completed or initiated in another state is not illegal.</P>

        <P>The 2004 gross allocation to my Department&rsquo;s Vote was &euro;127.753 million. The net allocation, having deducted estimated appropriations-in-aid of &euro;0.412 million, was &euro;127.342 million. The provisional outturn figures for 2004 were &euro;91.579 million gross and &euro;90.548 million net. The provisional surplus for surrender to the Exchequer was &euro;36.794 million.</P>
        <P>The 2004 provisional surplus was derived from the subheads set out in the following table and a note has been appended: (a) Where the saving is significant, i.e. where it exceeds &euro;10,000 and represents 25% or more of an administrative subhead allocation, or where it exceeds &euro;10,000 and represents 5% or more of a programme subhead allocation &mdash; this is in line with the presentation of such information in the appropriation accounts; (b) Where part of the savings on a subhead were vired to meet additional expenditure on another subhead and as such were not available for surrender to the Exchequer.</P>

        <P>The age tax credit, then the age tax allowance, was introduced by the Finance Act 1974. This provided an additional income tax personal allowance for the 1974-75 tax year and subsequent years. On its introduction, the age allowance was, in the case of a married person, &pound;50 or &euro;63 and for a single or widowed person, &pound;25 or &euro;32. The age tax credit was last changed in budget 2002 when, in the context of the changeover to the euro, its value was increased slightly to &euro;205 per annum for a single person aged 65 or over and to &euro;410 per annum for a married couple where one spouse is or both spouses are aged 65 or over.</P>
        <P>The question of a further increases in the value of the age tax credit will be a matter to be considered in the context of future budgets. However, I would point out to the Deputy that the approach adopted in recent years with regard to tax policy and the elderly has been to assist such persons primarily through increases in the age exemption limits under which those aged 65 <Col N="1784" />or over are exempt from income tax up to specified limits.</P>

        <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The position is that the VAT rating of medicine of a kind used for animal oral consumption is generally subject to the zero rate of VAT. However, under EU law, the supply of non-oral animal medicine does not qualify for the zero rate. The veterinary medicine in question, Bayvarol, is not taken orally and its supply is, therefore, subject to VAT at the rate of 21%.</P>
        <P>Under the EU sixth VAT directive, I am precluded from adding to the range of supplies subject to the zero rate of VAT.</P>

        <P>My Department has not allocated a specific overall provision in its 2005 Estimates towards the cost of implementing the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003.</P>
        <P>The main area of expenditure on the Irish language in my Department is through Gaeleagras na Seirbh&iacute;se Poibl&iacute;. Gaeleagras was established in the Department in 1971 with the general aim of promoting the Irish language throughout the Civil Service. Gaeleagras continues to make a significant contribution to the promotion and development of the use of Irish in the Civil Service including supporting the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003. In anticipation of an increased level of activity in 2005, the allocation for Gaeleagras this year is &euro;369,000, an increase of &euro;131,000 over the 2004 outturn. Up to June, 2005, Gaeleagras have spent &euro;74,000 of<?oasys _jy?>this allocation. It is anticipated that the full allocation will be spent during the remainder of 2005.</P>
        <P>Outside Gaeleagras, work relating to implementing the Official Languages Act 2003 is spread across the Department and is undertaken in conjunction with officials&rsquo; existing duties. It is, therefore, not possible to provide an overall cost for the implementation of the Act in the Department in 2005. However, the additional costs incurred by the Department associated with using external translation and printing services etc. arising from the Act is &euro;6,342 to-date in 2005 and is estimated at around &euro;40,000 for the full year in 2005.</P>

        <P>At recent meetings of EU Finance Ministers, there has been discussions about exploring the possibility of introducing a tax on aviation fuel or a levy, compulsory or optional, on airline tickets for the purposes of raising revenue for development aid. Opinions differed on the wisdom of such an approach. Following these discussions, the European Commission was asked to submit an analysis of all the issues involved in a compulsory or optional levy on the purchase of airlines<?oasys _jy?>tickets.</P>
        <P>However, some member states, including Ireland, expressed concerns about the impact on competitiveness which would arise from the imposition of a compulsory tax. This is of particular concern to a country like Ireland on the <Col N="1786" />periphery of Europe where transport costs are particularly significant.</P>

        <Quest>the extent of the practice of discretionary waivers at the Revenue Commissioners in respect of interest in the 1980s; if the practice was widespread; the number of cases that received such waivers; if he can state who in the Revenue Commissioners had the authority to allow such waivers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>Levying of interest charges is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the application or waiving of an interest charge in any instance is dealt with by Revenue under its powers of care and management. The exercise of these powers is carried on by and under the authority of the commissioners. I am informed by Revenue that payment of interest is considerably more problematic than payment of tax. Even in the present climate, where meeting tax obligations is increasingly seen as the correct thing to do, payment of interest is still strongly resisted with many taxpayers putting forward arguments for mitigation of the interest charge.</P>
        <P>It is clear that in the 1980s tax collection was radically different from what it is today. There was a significant and widespread problem of non-payment of tax at the time. Revenue&rsquo;s computer systems automatically calculated and issued an interest demand in respect of every late payment. However, this was entirely a process driven programme with no direct personal contact with the taxpayer and no differentiation between cases with genuine difficulties and those who were deliberately delaying payment.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the collection effort had to be directed towards the recovery of the tax itself. I have been advised by Revenue that it was not in a position to follow through on the interest charges and inevitably, the approach to interest was unsuccessful. In the circumstances, I am advised by Revenue that &ldquo;discretionary waivers&rdquo; in regard to interest did not generally arise. The reality was that, while interest charges were raised, widespread non-payment was the <i>de facto</i> situation with taxpayers systematically taking advantage of the fact that Revenue was not in a position to pursue payment. In the relatively limited number of cases where a taxpayer would have responded to the interest demand from Revenue by way of a request for waiver, such a request would have been considered on its merits and would in the normal course have been decided by the relevant officials in the Collector-General&rsquo;s office handling the case.</P>
        <P>Revenue policy and practice today in relation to interest collection are clear and very effective. <Col N="1787" />This is borne out by the fact that in 2004 debt was a mere 2.4% of collection for that year compared to 68% in 1988. This has been achieved through a combination of measures, including vastly improved collection performance and write-off of uncollectible debt.</P>

        <P>The Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable rural post office network as set out in the programme for Government. The overarching objective continues to be the retention of post office services in as many locations as possible in the manner which best meets consumer needs whether services are provided via post offices, postal agencies or the Postpoint network. I would like to outline my commitment and that of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to the post office network. This has been demonstrated in meetings with interested parties, including my meetings and those of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs with the IPU.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my view and that of my colleague, Deputy Brennan that we want to see An Post delivering social welfare payments to the maximum number of people. Quality customer services, however, mean that people must be allowed to choose their preferred method of payment. An Post has commenced work on a new business model for the post office network that will involve a substantial upgrade of information <Col N="1789" />technology systems to offer electronic funds transfer functionality to social welfare recipients and a wider suite of financial and other services to new and existing customers. Pending progress on the system upgrades, I have agreed with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that, for the moment, all payment options will receive equal standing on social welfare forms and that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will not actively push EFT for social welfare clients.</P>
        <P>On the issue of upgrading post offices, the automation of the network was completed in 1997 and it has only been in very exceptional circumstances, such as an existing automated office closing and its equipment being transferred to a suitable neighbouring location that transacts significant volumes of welfare business, that further offices were automated since then. However, I am convinced that An Post&rsquo;s long-term strategy must satisfactorily address electronic technology in a comprehensive fashion. In the interim, a pilot project will see ten small post offices computerised. In a separate initiative, the company, in conjunction with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is working on an initiative to automate nine island post offices. As many strands of the upgrade strategy are being advanced, I have informed the IPU that a meeting at this stage would not add much to the process but I have undertaken to keep it informed on this issue.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>The technologies to harness wave and tidal energies to produce electricity are at an early stage of research globally. An extensive research and development programme must be successful before this significant potential resource can be efficiently harnessed and the most suitable sites identified. Ireland participates in the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s research and development implementing agreement on ocean energy to monitor and benefit from worldwide expertise. In addition, at the national level, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and the Marine Institute have jointly commenced a research and development programme to identify the potential of wave and tidal energy in Ireland and also to assist industry to investigate prototype devices.</P>
        <P>Research projects under way include Tidal and Marine Current Energy Resource in Ireland, a study on the potential economic benefits from the development of ocean energy in Ireland and a study to establish the total, feasible, practical Irish offshore wave energy resource. Other research supported by SEI and the Marine Institute in recent years include Marine Institute &mdash; Development and Evaluation Protocol for Ireland in 2004, the Hydam Technology Limited design study support to finalise the mathematical model of the MWP in 2004, University College Dublin&rsquo;s tidal energy feasibility study in 2004, the ESBI&rsquo;s Inshore Atlantic Wave Regime: County Clare in 2003, Ocean Energy&rsquo;s B2D2 wave energy pilot plant in 2003 and Wavebob Limited&rsquo;s The Wavebob in 2004. It is anticipated that reports of these studies will be published in due course. I will continue to monitor progress to ensure that as the technologies develop, we are well placed to harness the significant wave and tidal resources.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>The most suitable locations for wind farms are those sites that can secure planning permission or a foreshore lease and licence in the case of offshore projects, have suitable wind speeds and can access the electricity network. Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, has published a digital map of our <Col N="1791" />onshore and offshore wind resource. The wind atlas is available on DVD-ROM from the Renewable Energy Information Office, Bandon, County Cork and a lower resolution version is accessible on the SEI website at <i>www.sei.ie</i>. These resources allow any interested party to identify suitable wind energy resources at heights of 50, 75 and 100 metres at any location.</P>
        <P>In addition, the draft wind farm planning guidelines published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2004 propose that areas suitable for the development of wind farms should be identified within each county development plan and will be published in final form shortly. As county development plans identify suitable sites, these can be cross-referenced to the wind resource map. It will then be possible to target infrastructure upgrades on the electricity networks at identified locations to maximise the contribution of wind energy to the electricity mix at least additional cost to consumers.</P>

        <P>Under Directive 85/337 and 97/11, assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, the developers of the Corrib gas field project submitted to my predecessor an environmental impact statement, EIS, together with their application for consent to construct a pipeline. In accordance with the requirements of EU and national legislation, the documentation was put on public display by the developers for a <Col N="1792" />period of one month for the making of objections and representations on the application.</P>
        <P>The environmental aspects of the development were examined fully by the marine licence vetting committee, MLVC, which is an independent body composed of professional experts across the disciplines relevant to the project. In addressing the EIS, the MLVC brought its own expertise to bear and fully examined any views of interested parties and those expressed by persons who, during the public consultation process, submitted observations. Following the consultation process and the MLVC deliberations, it submitted to my predecessor its considered views and recommendations.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment given at a seminar held in Geesala on 25 July 2001 and in the interests of transparency, the MLVC report on which my predecessor&rsquo;s decisions on the various applications were based was published. The Department and the environmental monitoring group, EMG, which was set up as a condition attaching to the various approvals, are monitoring the documentation submitted by the developers in compliance with the conditions attached to the pipeline consent. The EMG is composed of professional experts from the Department and other bodies across the disciplines relevant to the environmental conditions attached to the various approvals as well as departmental officials and members of Mayo County Council, Shell E &amp; P Ireland Limited and representatives from various local Mayo residents groups. This group meets on a monthly basis and has the responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, of exchanging information on the Corrib gas field project in respect of environmental management and monitoring. There is no prohibition on any individual member or representative group on the EMG providing this information publicly. I am aware that the resident groups' members hold regular meetings in their communities and this would be an appropriate opportunity for disseminating this information.</P>

The ban on such movements is still in force and will remain so. Officials of this Department are working closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Marine Institute and the Loughs Agency to arrange for sound practical measures to be put in place for shellfish operators to follow in Lough Foyle. In addition, the Marine Institute will work with this Department, the Northern Ireland authorities, the Loughs Agency and operators in Lough Foyle to carry out an epidemiological study, as required by EU regulations, into the possible causes of the outbreak.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>I have no statutory function in regard to industrial relations issues within An Post. It is an operational issue for the board and management of the company. The full resources of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery continue to be made available to management and unions to assist in resolving industrial relations issues at An Post. I have urged both sides to make full use of that <Col N="1794" />machinery and I understand that the process is still ongoing. The difficulties within An Post are long-standing and deep-seated and, therefore, obtaining agreement to a recovery strategy by all stakeholders has been difficult.</P>
        <P>In regard to the non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases, in which An Post has invoked the &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo; clause, the unions have referred this matter to the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the Labour Court. Following a hearing in the Labour Court in March 2005, the LRC appointed assessors to examine whether the company was correct to invoke the &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo; clause. The assessors&rsquo; report was presented to both parties in the LRC in early June. The key recommendation was for an increase of 5% backdated to 1 January 2005. An Post unions have not accepted this recommendation and the issue will now be referred to the Labour Court. An Post intends to implement the assessors&rsquo; recommendation and will pay employees a 5% increase at the end of June 2005 backdated to 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government decides the remuneration scale for the chairpersons of State bodies. Essentially, the remuneration package is dependent on the size of the body. Given its size and the importance of the services it provides, An Post is a category one State body and the fee level for the chairperson is &euro;19,046 per annum. However, a higher fee level than the norm can be approved by the Minister for Finance for individual chairpersons. This tends to arise when a State body is facing particular challenges and the commitment required of the chairperson would be greater than the norm. The board of An Post would have no role in deciding the remuneration package for the chairperson.</P>
        <P>The appointment of the current chairperson of An Post was made in February 2003 subject to payment of the normal fee for category one chairpersons. However, the chairperson sought an increased rate of remuneration in June 2003 arising from the significant time commitment that the chairperson considered was necessary. The fee sought was based on a rate per day that, when aggregated, amounted to an annual package of approximately &euro;50,000. By this time, it was clear that An Post was facing significant challenges both on the financial and industrial relations fronts and, as a result, the chairperson of An Post considered that a greater time commitment than the norm was required.</P>
        <P>The key role of the board was reiterated when my predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, met the board in October 2003 and reminded its members of their crucial oversight obligations in regard to the recovery strategy for An Post. To reflect the importance of the role of the chairperson in overseeing the recovery strategy, it was decided by the Minister for Finance that the chairperson could be offered a remuneration package of &euro;50,000 per annum which she has accepted. Members of the board at An Post are paid <Col N="1795" />&euro;12,635 per annum in line with Department of Finance guidelines.</P>

        <P>On 15 June 2005, I was pleased to launch on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy and the Irish Char Conservation Group its publication on Threatened Irish Freshwater Fishes. This publication makes a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of some of Ireland&rsquo;s rare native species which are an important and unique aspect of our natural heritage. The publication brings together important information as to what these rare fish species are, their distribution and status as well as recommendations for their future conservation.</P>
        <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection and conservation of <Col N="1798" />freshwater fish stocks rests with the central and regional fisheries boards. I understand that measures to protect the species referred to in the Royal Irish Academy&rsquo;s publication are being taken by the fisheries boards in the context of the European Union&rsquo;s water framework directive. In this regard, I am advised by the Central Fisheries Board that the status of smelt, shads and lamprey populations is currently being investigated by it and the regional fisheries boards as part of the national fisheries research programme and in specific locations on behalf of the national parks and wildlife service and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I am sure that the knowledge shared through the publication referred to by the Deputy will assist the fisheries boards meaningfully in their task of conserving and protecting these species. The central and regional fisheries boards are co-operating closely with other Departments and agencies in rolling out the water framework agenda. I am assured by the fisheries boards that for their part they will make every effort to ensure that, under this agenda, sufficient priority and focus will be placed on addressing the pressures on these particular species.</P>

        <P>I met representatives of snap net fishermen who operate on the River Suir in<?oasys _jy?>Carrick-on-Suir on 3 June. I have noted the issues and concerns that were raised at the meeting and will have the points that were put to me considered carefully in conjunction with the report on the matter that has been prepared by the Department&rsquo;s engineering division. The engineering division&rsquo;s report states that the effect on fishing of the waster water treatment plant outfall can only be described as localised and minor. The fishermen have also been invited to furnish to the Department copies of the fishing records for the section of the river that they say has been affected by the outfall. The formal granting of a licence under the Foreshore Acts in respect of the outfall is being finalised.</P>

        <P>The agreement for collaboration between the Marine Institute in Ireland and the Institute of Marine Research in Norway was set out in a memorandum of understanding signed on 15 June 2005. The programmes of research undertaken by the Marine Institute are funded through the annual grant made to it through the Department&rsquo;s Vote. The areas of collaboration include seabed, habitat and oceanographic surveys, fish farming and fish health, joint use of major equipment, exchange of personnel, collaboration on the ship time and best practice for the operation of research vessels. The collaboration will consist of creative exchange and facilities on approved national programmes at little additional cost to either partner.</P>
        <P>Under the programme on fisheries acoustics, the annual blue whiting acoustic survey measures the size of the blue whiting stock as it aggregates to spawn off the west of Ireland. The <i>RV Celtic Explorer</i>, Ireland, and <i>RV Geosars</i>, Norway, work closely together and exchange personnel. The total cost of this project is &euro;402,138, which is funded 50% by the Marine Institute and 50% by the EU. The survey fulfils Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the EU data collection regulation, EU Council Regulation 1543/2000. The memorandum of understanding is in force for a four-year period and it is not anticipated that any funding additional to that approved annually for the Marine Institute&rsquo;s overall research programmes will be required. The collaboration is designed to be mutually beneficial and to enhance the quality of the research work undertaken, and it is anticipated that it will deliver considerable additional value for money.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection, conservation and management of inland fisheries stocks is a matter for the relevant regional fisheries board, in this case the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. I am advised by the chief executive officer of that board that a fish kill occurred on a mill stream off the main River Shannon at the <Col N="1800" />University of Limerick on 11 June 2005. I understand that in the course of its investigation, the board observed a total of 544 dead fish in the millrace. While trout were the predominant species killed, other species killed included salmon parr, sea lamprey, dace, stoneloach and minnow.</P>
        <P>The fisheries board advises me that it has now identified the suspected source of the pollution and is compiling the evidence necessary to consider initiating a prosecution in the matter. I understand that the board has already been in contact with the suspected offender and requested that certain works be undertaken to prevent a recurrence of the incident. In the wider context, the regional fisheries board is strongly urging people on or near rivers to recheck their pollution control systems to ensure that they are sufficient for the task required.</P>

        <P>Primary responsibility for protecting water quality rests with the relevant local authorities and proposals to deal with environmental threats in this area are a matter for these bodies to decide in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Under the Fisheries Acts, the central and regional fisheries boards have primary responsibility for the protection, conservation and management of inland fisheries stocks and operate under the aegis of this Department. They co-operate closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and its agencies.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I understand that the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board provided assistance to the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent investigations carried out on water quality and its impact on fisheries in the River Liffey. I understand that the fisheries board agrees with the conclusion of the EPA that further investigations are required to identify and quantify the substances causing the oestrogenic effects. It is the board&rsquo;s view that such an analytical programme, due to its complexity, should be confined to locations where biological or oestrogenic effects are indicated. I am assured by the board&rsquo;s chief executive officer that it will continue to liaise with the EPA and give whatever assistance it can to further these investigations.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>A total of &euro;1.48 million of the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources 2004 Estimate provision was surrendered to the Exchequer. A table shows the budgets and outturns at a subhead level in 2004 for expenditure together with total estimated and actual receipts. The surrender to the Exchequer in any one year is a function of both expenditure and receipts in that year. It is not possible, therefore, to associate the surrender with specific subheads, although the table below does set out details of variations from planned expenditure at subhead level that contributed to overall gross savings.</P>
        <P>In general, savings under the annual Vote provisions arise within capital expenditure programmes. Prior to the introduction of the multi-<Col N="1802" />annual capital investment framework in 2004, Departments were allocated within the annual Estimates process a capital budget for the current year. No provision was made for the carry over of any capital savings to future years. This process did not facilitate best practice multi-annual project planning or guarantee the position in respect of future allocations for capital projects.</P>
        <P>The multi-annual capital investment framework, announced by the Minister for Finance in the December 2003 budget, provides for multi-annual capital envelopes of five years and year-to-year carry overs and addresses these difficulties by enabling Departments and their agencies to plan and manage more efficiently and effectively their capital investment programmes. Savings arising in one year can now be carried forward to fund future requirements as part of a multi-annual capital investment plan. A total of &euro;10 million of overall 2004 savings were, accordingly, carried over to 2005. The framework will also ensure that both a proper balance is maintained between different areas of investment and that value for money is obtained from capital investment.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
        <P>Natural gas and, in particular, the safe use of this important resource is a key priority. I have undertaken to strengthen existing legislation with the aim of enhancing public safety and reducing the number of gas related accidents taking place annually. To this end, I have obtained Government approval to prioritise the drafting of natural gas safety legislation that will be included in the energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.</P>
        <P>The legislation being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the promotion and regulation of safety in the downstream natural gas sector, including gas installers, shall become a function of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. Stemming from this, it is proposed the CER will establish and implement a natural gas safety regulatory framework and report to me on its functioning.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this process, my Department has carried out a public consultation process in conjunction with the CER in respect of natural gas safety, both as a clear signal to the market of my intention to see regulation strengthened in this area and also to allow the sector to provide positive inputs on the new safety regime proposed. The legislation also provides for a scheme of regulation specifically aimed at gas installers. Such a scheme will ensure that all future work on natural gas fittings conforms to the appropriate safety standards. It will also make it unlawful for any person who is not a certified natural gas installer to work on a natural gas fitting.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
        <P>As I have already informed the House several times, under the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2001 the regional fisheries boards are empowered to apply a permit charge for angling on fisheries under their control and management. However, the application of such a permit charge is an operational matter solely for the relevant board to decide, in this instance the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, and is not an issue over which I as Minister of State have any function.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board that it has had a permit charge for trout angling for many years on fisheries that it controls and manages in the region. I understand that the fisheries board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the board controlled fisheries on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species on the same water was not charged.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board assures me that the permit income is reinvested in the conservation and day-to-day management and development of these fisheries. In this regard, the board is actively promoting the region&rsquo;s fisheries abroad in partnership with tourist bodies and others relevant interested parties. However, the board advises me that while the Suck Valley Development Co-Operative Limited was invited to participate in this approach, it has so far declined to take part. As this is an operational matter for the board to determine, it would be inappropriate for me to intervene.</P>

        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme involves the relocation of the Maritime Safety Directorate and the Irish Coast Guard to Drogheda. The physical relocation of staff depends on the provision of accommodation in Drogheda and this is a matter for the Office of Public Works. The Government&rsquo;s decentralisation implementation group has set a timetable of late 2006 for facilities in Drogheda and the Office of Public Works is working to deliver on this schedule with the Departments concerned, including my Department. My Department is progressing arrangements for staff transfers both internally and with other Departments in advance of physical relocation to Drogheda. There are 71 expressions of interest for the 47 posts in the Maritime Safety Directorate and coast guard in Drogheda.</P>

        <Quest>his views on the calls (details supplied) to have a change in legislation in Britain requiring the automatic dismissal of any member of the British armed forces found guilty in a court of law of a serious human rights violation, whether murder, rape or torture; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>This call by members of the McBride family for a change in British legislation to require the automatic dismissal of a member of the British armed forces found guilty of a serious human rights violation is the latest effort in their campaign to ensure the dismissal of British army personnel James Fisher and Mark Wright. In 1995, Scots Guardsmen Fisher and Wright were convicted of the 1992 murder of Mr. Peter McBride, an unarmed Catholic teenager who was killed by two shots in the back. The two men were released after serving six years in prison and re-admitted to the British army despite their murder convictions. Since then, Mr. McBride&rsquo;s family has been seeking their dismissal from the army but several appeals of army board decisions to retain them have been unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>Legislation is in place that would allow for the dismissal of Mr. Fisher and Mr. Wright. The <Col N="1812" />Court of Appeal in Belfast gave a majority ruling on 13 June 2003 that there were &ldquo;no exceptional circumstances&rdquo; justifying the retention of the men. Mrs. McBride took further judicial review proceedings in April 2004 focusing on the refusal of the British armed forces minister to review the retention of the two soldiers in light of the appeals court&rsquo;s decision. Regrettably, Belfast High Court ruled yesterday that the decision to retain the soldiers remained effective even though the majority of judges found that there was no basis for it.</P>
        <P>As the family members of Mr. McBride make clear, the retention of the men in the British army in this context raises questions about the expected standards of behaviour for members of the British army. I fully support their call for these standards to be examined. While the enactment of legislation is a matter for the British Government and Parliament at Westminster, it certainly would be one way of undertaking that exercise and making changes where these were deemed necessary. The Government&rsquo;s objection to the continued retention of Mr. Fisher and Mr. Wright has been repeatedly raised with the British side, including through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC. We have also continued to raise the case through the offices of the Secretariat to the BIIGC.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 to 308, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Since the early 1990s, Ireland has provided in excess of &euro;30 million in assistance to the western Balkans, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In recent years, the focus has shifted from the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to projects and programmes that encourage the development of functioning public <Col N="1813" />administrations, economic development, including poverty reduction, and the emergence of a civil society. The objective is to work with the countries of the region to consolidate peace and stability and to ensure full respect for human rights and European democratic standards. Ireland also contributes significantly to projects that are implemented on a regional basis, including through the stability pact for south-eastern Europe.</P>
        <P>Details of support from my Department for Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Former <Col N="1814" />Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for 2004 and committed for 2005 are provided. We have also provided development personnel funding for the region amounting to approximately &euro;130,000. Four members of the Defence Forces are serving as military observers with UNMIK in Kosovo. For the period January 2004 to June 2005, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to UNMIK amounted to approximately &euro;1.2 million. The United Nations International Police Task Force, IPTF, concluded its mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the end of 2002.</P>

        <P>I have learned with regret of the death of Ms Gao Rong Rong, a Falun Dafa practitioner, who, according to reports, died on 16 June 2005. I have asked my officials to request the EU Presidency to raise the case of Ms Gao Rong Rong and the circumstances of her death with the Chinese authorities at the next session of the EU-China human rights dialogue which is due to take place in September. The EU-China human rights dialogue, established in 1996, is the formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns about individual human rights cases, including those of Falun Dafa practitioners and more general issues, such as the protection of freedom of religion and expression, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Dafa.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>There has been no change in the criteria applied to the landing and overflights of foreign military aircraft. Policy in this area is based on the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 which gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs discretion in the granting of permission to foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State. Permission is normally granted on certain conditions, such as that the aircraft is unarmed, is not carrying arms, ammunition or explosives, is not engaged in intelligence gathering and is not taking part in military exercises or operations. These conditions are not legal requirements but are policy stipulations that are applied at the discretion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that he can waive or vary at any time.</P>
        <P>In this latter regard, the Government made a specific offer to waive these normal criteria in the case of aircraft acting in pursuit of UN Security Council Resolution 1368 adopted after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. However, no country sought to avail of this exemption. As regards overflights and landings of US military aircraft relating to the situation in Iraq, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann voted on 20 March 2003, following an extensive discussion of the issues surrounding the US invasion of Iraq, to support the Government&rsquo;s decision to allow US military aircraft to continue <Col N="1818" />to overfly and land in Ireland. Furthermore, the United Nations Security Council has, since October 2003, adopted a number of resolutions asking members of the United Nations to give assistance to the multinational force in Iraq. The regulation of matters relating to commercial air carriers carrying foreign military personnel is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government remains gravely concerned at the deteriorating situation of human rights in Zimbabwe and the continuing failure of the Mugabe government to end repressive policies that have only succeeded in impoverishing and worsening the plight of millions of ordinary Zimbabweans. Ireland and its EU partners have taken the lead internationally, including through action at the UN General Assembly, in highlighting the serious human rights situation in Zimbabwe and in mobilising international pressure on the Zimbabwean Government to introduce long overdue democratic reforms.</P>
        <P>My officials and I have also been active in drawing attention to the serious plight of the former Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, MP in Zimbabwe, Mr. Roy Bennett, sentenced to a 12-month prison term last October for pushing the Zimbabwean Minister for Justice during a parliamentary debate last year and whose situation was the subject of a D&aacute;il motion adopted last March. I very much welcome that Mr. Bennett was granted early release and freed on 28 June.</P>
        <P>The EU has also condemned the recent actions of the Zimbabwean Government under the guise of Operation Restore Order which has resulted in many thousands of illegal street traders being arrested and an estimated 275,000 people left homeless as a result of a Government campaign to clear away the businesses of informal street traders and unregistered homes built by the urban poor. The European Union issued a declaration on 7 June condemning the actions undertaken by the Zimbabwean Government within the framework of Operation Restore Order and calling for its immediate end. A joint statement was also issued following the EU-US summit in Washington DC on 20 June expressing grave concern at the current situation and calling on the Zimbabwean Government to reverse its anti-democratic policies. The Irish ambassador to South Africa, who is also accredited to Zimbabwe, visited Zimbabwe in early June to assess the humanitarian effects of Operation <Col N="1819" />Restore Order and has submitted a full report on the situation.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to support the activities of Irish missionaries and NGOs, both national and international, who are responding to the worsening humanitarian situation provoked by Operation Restore Order. The Government has now decided to make an additional &euro;1 million available to the UN World Food Programme to support emergency feeding programmes in Zimbabwe for those worst affected by the current humanitarian crisis, with part of this assistance also being used for similar emergency feeding programmes in Malawi.</P>
        <P>I also very much welcome the decision by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to appoint Ms Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka, the executive director of UN Habitat, as his special envoy to assess the humanitarian consequences of the forcible eviction policies being pursued by the Zimbabwean Government. Ms Tibaijuka arrived in Zimbabwe on 26 June and will submit a full report on the situation to the Secretary General following her visit. This report will be of considerable assistance to the international community in gauging the appropriate international response to assist those who have been left homeless and without a livelihood as a result of this deliberate action on the part of the Zimbabwean Government.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours in the southern Africa development community, SADC, also have a potentially useful role to play in exerting influence on the Mugabe Government to stop Operation Restore Order, address its humanitarian consequences and also begin the process of implementing genuine reforms aimed at improving the situation of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. The EU regularly encourages the members of SADC and of the African Union to use their influence with Zimbabwe in this regard during the course of ongoing political dialogue with those organisations.</P>
        <P>The EU&rsquo;s concerns with Operation Restore Order were raised at a senior officials meeting with SADC in Johannesburg on 20 June while EU ambassadors are also being directed to make similar representations in SADC capitals. It would be appropriate for and I would encourage African Union leaders to address the human rights and humanitarian crisis resulting from Operation Restore Order at their forthcoming summit meeting in Sirte, Libya on 4 and 5 July.</P>

        <P>My Department monitors the situation in Colombia, including the question of hostages and kidnap victims, through our embassy in Mexico City, <Col N="1820" />which is also accredited to Colombia, as well as in co-operation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. As the House is aware from my replies to previous questions on this subject, Ms Ingrid Betancourt, a candidate in the 2002 Colombian presidential election, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, on 23 February 2002.</P>
        <P>During the Irish Presidency of the European Union last year, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, underlined the European Union&rsquo;s view of the importance of a rapid release of all remaining hostages and kidnapped persons. Ireland participated at the international meeting in support of the peace process in Colombia that took place in Cartagena in February 2005. The Cartagena Declaration issued at its conclusion called for the immediate freeing of all those kidnapped. At the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights, the chairperson&rsquo;s statement on Colombia of 21 April 2005, to which Ireland actively contributed, also urged the immediate and unconditional release of all the kidnapped persons in Colombia.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, met Mr. Juan Carlos Lecompte, the husband of Ms Ingrid Betancourt, on 28 June 2005 during his visit to Ireland. Deputy Treacy assured Mr. Lecompte that the Government shares his concern about the plight of his wife and the many others who are held hostage in Colombia. He said that Ireland, together with our EU partners, strongly condemns the practice of hostage-taking and kidnapping and we call upon all illegal armed groups in Colombia to release hostages immediately and unconditionally.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State added that we continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement with those illegal armed groups who may be prepared to negotiate a peace agreement. We will continue to work with our EU partners to encourage a resolution to the plight of Ms Betancourt and the other kidnap victims in Colombia.</P>

        <P>The allocation to Vote 29 on international co-operation for 2005 is &euro;470.8 million, an increase of &euro;70 million on the 2004 figure. As a result, total official development aid, ODA, for 2005 is expected to amount to approximately &euro;545 million when contributions from other Departments have been taken into account. This represents the highest allocation in the 30-year history of the Irish aid programme. In <Col N="1821" />addition, the Government has agreed to provide further increases of &euro;65 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007. These very substantial increases mean that over the three years from 2005 to 2007, &euro;1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance. This three-year multi-annual commitment incorporating very substantial annual increases gives my Department a sound basis to carry forward the long-term planning that is so important for development work.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the EU has recently agreed new targets for ODA. These provide that the EU 15 will reach a new collective target of 0.56% by 2010, while member states that have not yet reached a level of 0.51% undertake to individually reach that by 2010. Member states also undertake to achieve the UN target of 0.7% by 2015. The newer member states, which joined after 2002, have lower targets. This decision will bring an estimated &euro;20 billion extra funding by 2010 into play for developing countries and represents a strong signal to other non-European donors. The Government remains strongly committed to the UN target and will take a decision on a date for achieving this in advance of the UN millennium summit in September 2005.</P>

        <P>Mr. David Strudley was appointed on 23 June 2005 to head up the new PSNI policing college in Cookstown, County Tyrone, following a UK-wide advertisement campaign, interview and selection process. Mr. Strudley will take up his new post this September. The Patten commission recommended that recruit training for the police service should move away from a military focus, have a high degree of civilian input, dramatically reduce the amount of hours spent on drill and move away from command and control approaches to problem-solving community oriented approaches. The Government fully supports that objective as a key part of the move toward community policing, which is at the very heart of the Patten report.</P>
        <P>The issue of police training was recognised by the Patten report and the independent commission as critical to the overall success of the policing reforms. The oversight commissioner in his most recent 13th report acknowledges that significant progress has been made on the training recommendations made by the commission but emphasised that more needs to be done in this area. This crucial area will be the subject of continuing oversight by the oversight commissioner. I am aware that he is to carry out a major thematic report into the area of training <Col N="1822" />later this year, which will assess progress in this area. I am confident that under his supervision and that of the policing board the Patten commission&rsquo;s vision will be realised.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 321 together.</P>
        <P>The incidents in north Belfast referred to by the Deputy are a matter of great concern to the Government. These incidents, as with all such sectarian attacks, are reprehensible and without justification. I am aware that the summer is a particularly difficult time of year for many Nationalist residents of Belfast and the north east generally. Officials of my Department closely monitor the situation in north Belfast through their contacts locally with local business, community leaders and members of the clergy across the community divide.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that incidents to which he refers were immediately raised with the British Government through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast. Additionally, this recent spate of attacks on Nationalist homes in north Belfast was specifically discussed at the most recent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London on 27 June 2005 at which both the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach were in attendance. I will continue to seek reassurances from the British Government that appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all the residents of north Belfast.</P>
        <P>Interface tension has been eased somewhat in recent years through the establishment of a number of cross-community partnerships designed to provide an early warning system to diffuse potential flashpoint situations. These schemes have contributed significantly toward the improved atmosphere witnessed in recent years. <Col N="1823" />The Government is very supportive of these co-operative schemes that foster trust and respect within communities and will continue to promote their use in improving community relations. Furthermore, I have reiterated in my most recent meetings with political parties in the North the desirability for those with influence to do whatever they can to ease tensions and assist the efforts being made to ensure that the marching season passes off peacefully.</P>

        <P>The Police Ombudsman has published information on the status of the PSNI officers who were involved in the original Se&aacute;n Browne investigation in her report on the original investigation published on 19 January 2004. The report states that the senior investigating officer responsible for that investigation has now retired. The ombudsman also states that under the law, a retired officer cannot be made amenable for any misconduct occurring before his retirement.</P>
        <P>The ombudsman also investigated the role of the deputy senior investigating officer on the case. The ombudsman states in her report that due to the absence of the relevant file, it was impossible for her to audit the decision-making process and the degree of autonomy that the officer in question had. The officer was still serving in the PSNI at the time of the ombudsman&rsquo;s findings and I have made inquiries as to whether this is still the case. An extensive search was carried out by the Police Ombudsman for the missing file.</P>
        <P>As recommended by the ombudsman, a complete reinvestigation into the murder of Mr. Se&aacute;n Browne is under way and the PSNI officers involved in this new investigation have no link with the original police investigation. Additionally, officials from my Department sit on the advisory group to this investigation along with members of the Browne family, their legal adviser, a representative of the Pat Finucane Centre and an external consultant.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The display of flags and emblems in Northern Ireland is an emotive and often controversial practice that has been the subject of much discussion both internally within the relevant agencies in the North and also between my officials and their British counterparts. The specific situation in Limavady was highlighted in media reports earlier in the week and, as a result, I have asked the British authorities to update me with regard to the ongoing efforts to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all those in the Edenmore area. I hope to receive a reply on the matter in the coming days.</P>
        <P>More generally, I note the recent signing of a protocol that will lead to renewed efforts to prevent illegal banners appearing in public places. The PSNI, the Offices of the First and Deputy First Minister, the Department for Regional Development, the Department of the Environment, the Department for Social Development and the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland have agreed to tackle this scourge cumulatively, particularly focusing their efforts on those flags and banners that show support for proscribed organisations. Community engagement on this issue has led to the removal of a number of these illegal banners in recent years, mainly in the wider Belfast area, and it is hoped that continued involvement in this process at a local level will generate similar results throughout Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government views the use of flags to mark out territory, promote sectarianism or intimidate people as completely unacceptable. I can assure the Deputy that the progress of this recently established multi-agency partnership will be closely monitored as it attempts to remove flags and emblems from arterial routes and town centres and the removal of all paramilitary flags and displays throughout the North.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government remains fully supportive of the African Union&rsquo;s crucial role in attempts to resolve the ongoing political, security and humanitarian crisis in Darfur. The AU&rsquo;s observer mission, AMIS, in particular, is playing an extremely valuable role in addressing the security situation in Darfur. It has been demonstrated that where AMIS is deployed in Darfur, a marked reduction in violence follows. There is a clear need, though, to increase further the size of the AMIS mission if the situation locally is to be fully stabilised and suitable conditions created for the safe return of internally displaced persons, IDPs, and refugees.</P>
        <Col N="1825" />
        <P>I welcome the recent decision by the AU Peace and Security Council to expand its mission from 3,200 to more than 7,700 personnel. The strong support evident at the donors conference held in Addis Ababa last month at which $300 million was pledged to assist with the planned expansion of AMIS demonstrates the international community&rsquo;s confidence in the African Union&rsquo;s efforts to try and resolve the Darfur conflict.</P>
        <P>The External Relations Council agreed on 23 May that the EU should lend all possible support to AMIS&rsquo;s military, police and civilian efforts and a specific package of assistance focusing on logistical and planning support was outlined by the High Representative, Mr. Javier Solana, at the donors conference in Addis Ababa. Ireland was also represented at the Addis Ababa meeting and pledged to provide additional financial support for the expansion of AMIS as part of the overall EU package of support. I subsequently informed the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, when I met him in New York on 2 June that Ireland would contribute an additional &euro;1 million to support the expanded AMIS operation. It is intended that this further contribution will be earmarked for the humanitarian and human rights components of the AMIS mission. This is in addition to the &euro;500,000 for the humanitarian and human rights elements of AMIS that Ireland provided last year.</P>
        <P>The Government has also agreed to make available an officer from the Permanent Defence Force to serve as a logistics planner in supporting the expansion of AMIS. An Army officer has also served as an EU observer with the AMIS mission, though his 12-month assignment will finish at the end of this month. Ireland&rsquo;s support to AMIS is in addition to &euro;15 million that has been pledged to Sudan over the next two years. This funding will be used to meet immediate needs such as food security, return of the displaced and basic education and will also begin to address the long-term development needs of the Sudan.</P>

I raised the issue of Tibet and recent developments there during the official talks with Vice Premier, Huang Ju, in Dublin on 16 November 2004. In response, the Vice Premier said that the channels of communications between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama were open and China would continue to work to ensure peace and development in Tibet.</P>
        <P>An EU troika of human rights experts visited Tibet between 20 and 23 September 2004. Ireland will encourage similar contacts during the forthcoming British Presidency. The Government has consistently called on the Chinese authorities to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people, including their socio-economic and human rights. We will continue to address our ongoing concerns regarding Tibet, both bilaterally and within the framework of the EU-China dialogue.</P>

        <P>The Government has consistently sought to promote local accommodation in instances where parades are contentious. It has done so by promoting direct dialogue between all parties to such disputes and by consistently supporting the work of the Parades Commission. The Government has also paid close attention to the policing of parades, to monitor the way the commission&rsquo;s determinations are policed and to ensure that the intent of the commission is fully upheld. Concerns regarding these issues are raised through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
        <Col N="1827" />
        <P>My officials are in regular contact with residents groups throughout Northern Ireland, including in Ardoyne, west Belfast, Portadown, Derry, Dunloy and east Belfast, and also with community leaders who have influence. During our contacts with members of the loyal orders we have stressed the desirability of contentious parades being resolved through dialogue and mutual agreement. In this regard, I welcome the agreement reached by the community forum in Derry that will result in the 12 July parade in the city going ahead with the support of all concerned. The Chamber of Commerce in Derry deserves particular praise for bringing the relevant stakeholders together and for providing a forum through which outstanding concerns from all perspectives could be answered in a positive and tolerant setting. I hope that the continuing example of mutual respect and tolerance for diversity shown by those in Derry can highlight to others in Northern Ireland that the parades issue is resolvable and need not be an annual source of conflict between the two communities.</P>

The 2004 budgetary allocation for Vote 29 was &euro;400,030,000. Outturn for the period amounted to &euro;397,541,000 resulting in an underspend of &euro;2,489,000. Under the terms of the Administrative Budget Agreement 2002-2004, an amount of &euro;789,000 was carried forward to 2005.

A training programme was also in place to assist staff in developing their Irish language skills. This was and is part of a wider policy aimed at developing the Department&rsquo;s capability to accommodate those customers who would prefer to conduct their business with the Department through Irish. As a consequence, there has been no expenditure to date in 2005 that can be attributed solely to implementing the provisions of the Act.</P>
        <Col N="1828" />
        <P>The only expenditure likely to arise in this regard during 2005 relates to the publication by the Department of a notice under section 13 of the Act. This requirement will arise when the Department is formally requested by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to prepare a draft scheme specifying the services that the Department will provide through Irish or English only and those that will be provided through both languages. The notice will invite submissions from the public and a draft scheme will then be prepared and submitted for approval to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The cost of publishing the notice is estimated at &euro;12,000 to &euro;15,000. It is unlikely that the scheme itself will fall to be published this year as the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has not yet formally requested the Department to prepare it and as the Act provides a period of up to six months for its preparation.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 346 together.</P>
        <P>The management of the National Aquatic Centre, NAC, is undertaken by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, a company specifically established under the legislation to manage the Abbotstown project. Its <Col N="1830" />shareholders are the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. The chairman of the board of CSID is a member of the staff at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. The Office of Public Works acts as a technical adviser to the Department in matters relating to Abbotstown.</P>
        <P>The Department works closely with the CSID on all matters relating to Abbotstown, including the operation of the National Aquatic Centre. My Department and I have been kept fully informed of developments at the NAC, including the matter of the repair work that was necessary as a result of the storm damage to the roof in January. At the request of the Department, the Office of Public Works commissioned Kavanagh, Mansfield and Partners to examine the damage to the roof and provide a report on the matter. The findings of the report guided the response of the CSID and were taken into account in agreeing the repair programme that was carried out in the shortest possible timeframe. There are legal, contractual and financial issues that are still ongoing and are being considered in the light of this report and it would not be appropriate to publish it or comment on its findings at present. It was unfortunately necessary to close the centre during the period while work was taking place as the primary concern was the safety of members of the public and the staff employed at the National Aquatic Centre.</P>
        <P>As I have stated already, I am not prepared to comment on unsubstantiated media reports about the National Aquatic Centre except to state that the centre has been reinstated and is now fully operational. The centre was developed to provide a 50 metre pool for Ireland&rsquo;s needs and specifically to provide a suitable location for hosting the aquatic events of the Special Olympics World Summer Games. Since the centre was opened to the public in March 2003, it has successfully hosted the Special Olympics World Summer Games and later in that same year the European Short Course Championships, both to significant acclaim. Indeed, the National Aquatic Centre has justly drawn much well deserved admiration from those who have visited it and used its facilities. In its first year of operations, it had close to 1 million visitors, which placed the facility among the top attractions in Ireland.</P>

        <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The prog<Col N="1831" />ramme is advertised on an annual basis. Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December 2004. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. All of the 1,362 applications received before that deadline are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
        <P>I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed and to announce details of and invite applications to the 2006 sports capital programme before the end of this year. The guidelines, terms and conditions for the next programme have yet to be decided but are likely to be generally similar to those used for the 2005 programme. Consideration has been given to applications submitted by or on behalf of voluntary and community organisations, including sports clubs, in certain circumstances, schools, colleges and local authorities and national governing bodies of sport and third level education institutions, where it is evident that the proposed facility will contribute to the regional and-or national sporting infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Applications from schools and colleges must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must provide for significant levels of usage by the local community during periods when the facilities are not being used by the school itself, at least 30 hours per week throughout the year, and demonstrate that the facilities concerned will meet an identified deficiency in that locality, as formally agreed with other local groups and-or the local authority. Projects must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process and purchase of permanently based sports equipment, for instance, it is securely housed and will remain in use for five years or more. The programme does not assist in the purchase of sites, premises or personal equipment such as sports kits, gloves, shoes, boots, personal protective clothing, etc.</P>

        <P>A grant of &euro;200,000 was provisionally allocated to the project in question under the 2003 national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department. The grant allocation was subject to the <Col N="1832" />terms and conditions of the programme, including the execution of a Deed of Covenant and Charge, which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. My Department&rsquo;s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, CSSO, deals with the grantee&rsquo;s solicitor in executing this deed.</P>
        <P>I understand that the CSSO is still awaiting some of the required documentation from the organisation&rsquo;s solicitor and sent a further reminder to the solicitor last week regarding the documentation still awaited. No payment of the grant can be made until the deed of covenant and charge is executed. In the event that the relevant documentation is not provided expeditiously, the question of the withdrawal of the grant will fall to be considered.</P>

        <P>Under the terms of the local authority swimming pool programme, Offaly County Council applied grant aid to refurbish the swimming pools in Clara and Birr, to provide a new pool in Tullamore and to replace the pool in Edenderry. As I indicated in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 192 by the Deputy on 12 October 2004, the council was asked to identify its priorities concerning the development of swimming pools in the county, as projects of this nature require considerable capital commitment by local authorities. In this regard, the council recently indicated to my Department that it had decided to prioritise its applications for the refurbishment of the pool in Birr in 2005 and for the provision of a pool in Tullamore in 2006. Accordingly, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I recently approved the preliminary report for the refurbishment of the pool in Birr. This approval allows the council to have the detailed contract documents prepared for the project.</P>

        <P>The contract for the development of the National Aquatic Centre was awarded by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited to a consortium comprising Rohcon Limited, Dublin Waterworld Limited and Waterworld (UK) Limited. The final account agreed with Rohcon is &euro;63,325,294, which is made up of the contract amount of &euro;62,090,192 plus change orders of &euro;1,235,102. These figures are exclusive of VAT. The Rohcon account included design and plant costs. Equipment, fit out and commissioning costs would have been a matter for Dublin Waterworld Limited, a private company established to operate the National Aquatic Centre.</P>
        <P>Project management-contract administration was provided to the CSID by Davis Langdon PKS. The original fee was &euro;839,931. The post practical completion fee was &euro;27,648. Expenses were &euro;30,000. Consultancy fees in excess of &euro;10,000 were paid to the executive services team led by Magahy and Company and McCann FitzGerald, legal advisers. The amounts paid would have related not only to the National Aquatic Centre but also to the wider Sports Campus Ireland project. A consultancy fee of &euro;313,069 was paid to High Point Rendel for the provision of the overview report of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited. With the exception of High Point Rendel, which was a UK-based company, the jurisdiction of the firms to whom the above amounts were paid was Ireland but some of these firms would have had sub contractors from outside Ireland.</P>

        <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December 2004. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. All applications received before the deadline, including one from the organisation in question, are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

        <P>Funding is available from my Department for sports related projects through the national lottery-funded sports capital programme. This programme allocates funding towards the provision of sporting and recreational facilities to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional <Col N="1837" />and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. No application was received under the 2005 programme from a local authority or from any organisation in the areas listed by the Deputy in respect of a public basketball facility. The deadline for receipt of applications under the 2005 programme was 4 February.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>I expect to be in a position to advertise the 2006 sports capital programme later this year. At that time, it will be open to local authorities or any other qualifying group to make an application, should they have a suitable project that meets the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to work closely and effectively with Dublin City Council and the other local authorities in respect of the provision of public sports facilities. The Government, through my Department, has provided substantial funding towards the provision of a number of municipal-multi-sport facilities throughout Dublin city and other areas of the country. In this regard, my Department would be pleased to consult with Dublin City Council on any proposals it may wish to bring forward regarding the provision of public basketball facilities in the areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that the Government, through my Department, has allocated a total of &euro;779,000 in sports capital grants since 1999 to Basketball Ireland, the national<?oasys _jy?>governing body for the sport, towards its community hoops programme. This programme aims to install outdoor basketball hoops in parks and playgrounds throughout Ireland with a particular focus on areas of disadvantage. This allows<?oasys _jy?>for instant and free access to the sport for<?oasys _jy?>all members of the community. Further<?oasys _jy?>information on the community hoops programme, including an application form to have hoops installed, is available to interested parties on <i>www.basketballireland.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>Following a series of meetings last year with representatives of the National Community Games to discuss issues relating to the hosting of the annual community games finals in Mosney, I approved funding of &euro;100,000 towards the renovation of the accommodation at the Mosney Holiday Centre specifically to ensure that the facilities there were of a comfortable standard for use by the community games&rsquo; participants. In the context of those discussions, the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, confirmed its continu<Col N="1838" />ing willingness to facilitate the availability of Mosney to host the games.</P>
        <P>The community games&rsquo; representatives have expressed their satisfaction with the range and quality of the facilities and services available at Mosney and their suitability for future national events. They also acknowledged that there is no other venue in Ireland with the scale and variety of facilities required for their national events as currently structured and also that any question of providing a special, dedicated venue on the scale required, which would be used only a few times a year, would be completely unrealistic. I am pleased that the RIA has confirmed that for as long as the agency continues to use Mosney, the community games can avail of the facilities there. A new contract was signed between Mosney Irish Holidays Limited and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 18 November 2004.</P>

        <P>Prior to the enactment of the Official Languages Act 2003, my Department was already meeting the required standards of bilingual practice in areas, for example, such as stationery and in the placing of public advertisements. The costs arising to date in 2005 amount to &euro;2,000. My Department was included in the first tranche of public bodies required to produce an Irish language scheme under section 11 of the Official Languages Act. Following a public consultation process, such a scheme was prepared by my Department in line with the central guidelines prepared by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on preparation of language schemes. The scheme, which covers the three year period 2005-08, was recently confirmed by my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and becomes effective on 1 July 2005. A copy of the scheme will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website on 1 July. It is estimated that the total costs arising from the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 for the full year 2005 will be approximately &euro;45,000. These costs which include staff training costs will be met from within my Department&rsquo;s existing budget.</P>

My Department does not have overall responsibility for public transport matters or public transport safety matters specifically, except to the extent that occupational safety, health and welfare legislation, which is administered and enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, applies to employees in the sector, as it does to employees in every sector of the economy.</P>

This directive applies to activities in which workers are or are likely to be exposed to risks from mechanical vibration during their work. It relates to &ldquo;hand-arm vibration&rdquo; and &ldquo;whole body vibration&rdquo; and will apply, <i>inter alia</i> to vehicles with poor suspension and vehicles with badly designed or positioned controls or <Col N="1842" />which require drivers to adopt a poor driving posture. It may be possible that some public transport vehicles fall into this category and it will be a matter for companies operating public transport services to comply with the directive when it is transposed. Transposition regulations are being developed by the Health and Safety Authority, which, when signed and brought into operation, will involve protecting workers from risks in this area.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the findings of the report to which the Deputy refers. I would add that these findings coincide with Ireland&rsquo;s experience of economic migration. Research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute has found that as a result of inward migration, economic growth in Ireland was 3.7% higher in the period 1999 to 2003, than it otherwise would have been without any loss of employment or reductions in wage levels.</P>

        <P FLI="0">IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Wexford, for the medium to long term, is to concentrate resources on the national spatial strategy hub and <Col N="1842" />county town of Wexford as the location with the greatest potential to develop as a first class location for inward investment from overseas. <Col N="1843" />Other towns in the county, including Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey, are expected to benefit from the greater dynamism that the national spatial strategy gateway and hub locations of Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny can bring to the wider south-east region. For the short term, IDA will concentrate efforts on Enniscorthy and New Ross where there are available advance technology buildings to market to overseas clients. County Wexford has a total of 1,993 people working in IDA-supported companies as at the end of 2004. This compares with 1,839 people in 2002 and 1,740 people in 2001.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of years, IDA Ireland has been seeking to attract overseas companies in newer sectors to Wexford and the profile of clients has been changing, with Lake Region and Waters Corporation &mdash; medical technologies, as well as PFPC and Equifax &mdash; international services, now firmly established in the county. IDA Ireland is committed to continue marketing Wexford as a location for knowledge-intensive industries.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland approved funding of over &euro;43 million and made payments of over &euro;33 million to client companies in County Wexford in the period 1992 to date to assist them with development projects. The development of community-based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise. Since 1993, Enterprise Ireland has provided support of over &euro;640,000 towards the development of community enterprise centres in Tagoat, Wexford and Enniscorthy in County Wexford. In addition, almost &euro;60,000 has been provided in support of management development in these centres.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to foster job creation in County Wexford. Enterprise Ireland job creation activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>

        <P>There are no plans at present to review or change the legislation governing this particular area of employment law. However, the Government has recently established the employment rights review group, comprising representatives of this Department, the employment rights bodies &mdash; Labour Court, Employment Appeals Tribunal and Labour Relations Commission &mdash; Rights Commissioner Service &mdash; and the social partners. The employment rights review group will work to improve considerably the levels of customer service that the various employment rights bodies can offer to those using the dispute resolution services. It will also facilitate the simplification and modernisation of procedures and provide greater transparency and ease of access for all users. The employment rights review group will be chaired by an assistant secretary at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will report annually to the Government on progress and issues arising.</P>
        <P>A related programme of work is to be undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General to simplify, harmonise and consolidate the corpus of employment rights legislation. This programme, to be assisted by the employment rights review group, will bring forward proposals for a coherent and consolidated corpus of legislation for consideration by Government. This will not involve changes in statutory employment rights entitlements or affect the adjudicative independence of the employment rights bodies.</P>

        <P>On the issue of a definition of the term &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;, the definition in current use is that contained in the report of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying which defines bullying as: ...repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual&rsquo;s right to dignity at work. An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work but as a once off incident is not considered to be bullying.</P>

        <P>I understand from IDA Ireland that the company in question has confirmed that there have been no recent job losses, nor are any job losses planned, at its facility in County Kildare where over 2,500 people are employed. The company, which employs over 150,000 people worldwide, has recently announced a global workforce reduction of 15,000, but this is not expected to impact on the Leixlip facility.</P>
        <P>The State development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are promoting the Leixlip and Lucan areas for employment creation and investment. I am satisfied that the strategies and policies being pursued by the agencies will continue to provide sustainable job creation and investment in these areas.</P>

        <Quest>if he will provide a synopsis on the legislation in the area of baby-sitting, indicating the minimum ages for those entrusted with the care of children, the hourly wage and maximum hours that can be worked; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
        <P>My Department does not have a function in regard to the regulation of child care, including baby-sitting. With regard to employment rights generally, the position is that, where there is an employer-employee relationship through a contract of employment &mdash; whether express or implied, oral or in writing &mdash; the provisions of a wide range of Employment Rights Acts apply. There are however, no provisions in any of these Acts that refer specifically to the task of baby-sitting or the care of children.</P>
        <P>Currently, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 provides that every adult worker is entitled to receive a statutory minimum rate of pay of &euro;7.65 per hour. In certain circumstances, the Act also provides for the application of sub-minimum rates. For example, employees who are under 18 years of age are entitled to &euro;5.36 per hour.</P>
        <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 is concerned with the establishment of maximum hours of work that may be undertaken by children &mdash; persons under 16 years of age &mdash; and young persons &mdash; 16 and 17 year olds. Employers may not employ children in a regular full-time job, but may take on 14 and 15 year olds on light work, during the school holidays, part-time during the school term or as part of an approved work experience or educational programme where this work is not harmful to their safety, health or development. Under <Col N="1848" />the 1996 Act, 14 and 15 year olds may work nil or eight hours, respectively, per week during term time; may work 40 hours work experience during holidays; are entitled to 30 minutes rest after four hours work and 14 consecutive hours rest in every 24 hour period and employment may not begin before 8 a.m. or after 8 p.m. The 1996 Act also provides that for 16 and 17 year olds hours of work should not exceed a maximum of 40 hours per week; rest periods should be 12 consecutive hours in every 24 hour period; rest breaks should be of 30 minutes duration after working four and a half hours and employment may not begin before 6 a.m. or after 10 p.m. The employment rights information unit of my Department can make available a series of information booklets that cover the essential elements of each piece of legislation mentioned above. These can also be downloaded from the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.entemp.ie/employmentrights.</i></P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>As I have advised the House previously, I am aware of the high market share held by certain companies engaged in the promotion and sale of concert and theatre tickets. The Competition Act 2002 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position and other anti-competitive activities. The Act is enforced by the Competition Authority, which operates independently of my Department. Accordingly, if there are any allegations of anti-competitive practices, they should be referred to the authority for investigation.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The issue regarding the cost of creating IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs is a day-to-day matter for the agencies themselves and not one in which I am directly involved. Data indicating the average cost of creating IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs is compiled from an annual employment survey carried out by Forf&aacute;s &mdash; see following table. The cost per job is calculated by taking into account all agency expenditure on all firms in the period of calculation. Enterprise Ireland reports that the average cost per job created and sustained over the seven-year period 1998 to 2004 was &euro;7,956. Over the seven-year period 1998-2004, there have been 101,438 <Col N="1849" />jobs created in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies. The sustainability of these jobs is reflected in the decreasing cost per job over the same period. IDA Ireland reports that the average cost per job created and sustained over the <Col N="1850" />seven-year period 1998 to 2004 was &euro;14,673. The employment survey tables show a trend towards a falling cost per job in firms supported by both agencies.</P>

        <P>The final report of the consumer strategy group, entitled Make Consumers Count &mdash; A New Direction for Irish Consumers, was published on 18 May 2005. It has as its core recommendation that a new national consumer agency be established. This recommendation has been accepted in principle by the Government. The establishment of the new agency will require primary legislation and my Department has already commenced preparatory work on this matter. In order to maintain the momentum of the consumer strategy group&rsquo;s report, earlier this month I appointed a board to the new agency to act in an interim capacity until such time as the national consumer agency is established on a statutory footing.</P>
        <P>The report has also recommended that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 be revoked in its entirety. As indicated in my response to the House on 14 April 2005, I have now commenced a public consultation process whereby all interested parties are invited to make submissions on this recommendation, up until 31 July 2005. The views of all interested parties will be taken into consideration before any decision is taken in relation to the order.</P>

        <P>There is one vacancy at present on the board of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.

        <P>The position regarding vacancies expected to arise before 31 December 2005, on the boards of statutory or State bodies <Col N="1851" />under the remit of my Department is set out in the following paragraphs.</P>
        <P>There is currently one vacancy on the board of the National Standards Authority of Ireland. No further vacancies are expected this year. Subject to paragraph 1(3) of the Second Schedule of the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996, the members of the board are appointed by the Minister from among those interests involved in the process of standardisation and certification of commodities, processes and practices, without any single interest predominating, taking into account guidelines issued from time to time by the Government and, in particular, providing for staff representation and gender balance on the board.</P>
        <P>Two vacancies are expected to arise on the board of Science Foundation Ireland between now and 31 December 2005. In accordance with section 8(4) of the Act, appointments to the board of Science Foundation Ireland are made by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance following consultation with the Minister for Education and Science. Appointments are made on the basis of the relevant experience and skills of the individuals concerned. The issues of gender balance and industrial and higher education expertise are also taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>Appointments to the board of Enterprise Ireland are subject to the conditions of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, which provides for two members to retire annually by rotation from the board. Two such retirements are expected before the end of 2005. Following consultation with Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment proposed that the Minister reappoint the outgoing board members. The Minister has approved the reappointment of both members and has sought the consent of the Minister for Finance. The chairperson of Enterprise Ireland is also due to retire before the end of 2005. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment proposed his reappointment for a further three years. Following consultation with the Taoiseach and the Tan&aacute;iste, the Minister has approved the reappointment and has sought the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Two vacancies are expected to arise on the board of the IDA before the end of 2005. Appointments to the board of the IDA are subject to the conditions of the Industrial Development Acts, which provide for two members to retire annually by rotation from the board. A decision will be made on potential candidates, bearing in mind the needs of the agency.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>The range and type of services which An Post provides to its customers is, in the first instance, a commercial matter for the company. I have met with the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post regarding the further delivery of welfare entitlements. I have no role or function in this regard. I am aware that An Post is mindful of the need to move to a more modern payment system. As a result, I have been assured that An Post will respond to developments and product innovation in the money transmission market so that it can maintain its position as a leading player in this area of commercial activity.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to maintaining a viable network of post offices throughout the country and the issues involved are under consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who is the Minister responsible for An Post. I have already met with him on this matter and I <Col N="1859" />will continue to liaise with him as appropriate. My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that a range of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually improved by providing access to the wide range of payment options and new services and facilities now available. Some 58% of customers currently receive payment through their local post office, 10% are paid by cheque through the postal system and 32% receive direct electronic payment to their accounts with financial institutions.</P>
        <P>The growth in the number of customers opting for the direct payment option can be attributed to a number of reasons, such as the growing use of electronic payments in business and society generally, the increase in the use of electronic banking and debit-credit cards by people and the changing profile of our customer base across all schemes. As I have stated in the past, it is my responsibility to ensure that welfare customers are given choices as regards the payment methods for their entitlements. My priority is to ensure that the most modern, the most flexible and widest range of options are available to our welfare customers.</P>
        <P>An Post and my Department have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State. There is a very good working relationship between my Department and the company and I am sure that An Post will continue to have an important role in the delivery of social welfare payments in the future.</P>

        <P>The ongoing review of forms and information leaflets is an integral part of the day-to-day business of my Department. My Department uses a variety of consultative methods to assist with these reviews and to help identify areas for improvement. For example, feedback is obtained from our day-to-day contacts with customers, my Department&rsquo;s information officers, customer panels, customer surveys and from Comhairle, the national information agency. This enables my Department to be responsive to our customers&rsquo; needs and ensures that forms and information material are customer-friendly, simple and easy to understand.</P>
        <P>As a result of our internal reviews and consultation with our customers, my Department has now implemented a &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; policy on all application forms and leaflets. Staff from the information services unit work closely with the <Col N="1860" />National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and currently all our application forms and information leaflets are vetted by NALA before going to print.</P>

        <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing indebtedness. There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service. MABS does not generate statistics on indebtedness and, consequently, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
        <P>MABS, through MABS National Development Limited, is in the process of developing a computer system that will provide relevant statistics on indebtedness. MABS is centred on the needs of the customer and it is vital that the various needs of customers are met. This system, when operational, will add another positive dimension to the role of MABS.</P>

        <P>My Department operates a policy, under sanction of the Department of Finance, whereby overpayments, in respect of which there has been no recovery activity for three years and there is no immediate prospect of such recovery, are written off. The purpose of this provision, when introduced, was to avoid carrying forward large irrecoverable overpayments in the accounts of this Department.</P>
        <P>The amounts written off in each of the three years in question were &euro;7.9 million in 2002, &euro;6.7 million in 2003 and &euro;6.4 million in 2004 &mdash; provisional. The fact that a case is written off for accounting purposes does not mean that it cannot be recovered at a later date and if the opportunity subsequently arises to do so, recovery is pursued. Sums recovered post write off for the three years <Col N="1861" />in question are &euro;1.3 million in 2002, &euro;1 million in 2003 and &euro;1.5 million in 2004 &mdash; 2004 figures are provisional figures.</P>

        <P>The average processing time for appeals closed in 2004 was 20 weeks and 90% of cases were finalised within 15 weeks. This covers all phases of appeals, including, where appropriate, examination by medical assessors of the Department and oral hearings, which are now afforded in approximately 70% of the cases determined by appeals officers.</P>
        <P>Some appeals will always take a particularly long time to process, generally for reasons which are outside the control of the appeals office, for example, delays can occur if the appellant furnishes new evidence which requires investigation at a late stage in the proceedings or where adjournments are sought by the appellant and his/her representative. The social welfare appeals system is judicial in nature and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant&rsquo;s case gets full and satisfactory consideration. While the achievement of further improvement in processing times is a major objective of the office, at all times it is necessary that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which ensures that every appeal is fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

        <P>Social welfare inspectors appointed under section 212 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1998 are responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for ensuring that employers and the self employed comply with the legal requirements regarding pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions. In 1990, joint inspection units &mdash; JIU &mdash; comprising personnel from both the Department of Social and Family Affairs, DSFA, and Revenue Commissioners inspectorates were established countrywide to combat social welfare fraud and tax evasion. These units work together to identify employers who are not complying with the PAYE/PRSI regulations and who are abusing social welfare schemes.</P>
        <P>A service level agreement between this Department and the office of the Revenue Commissioners defines the administrative and operational arrangements of these units. This joint co-operation, drawing as it does on the expertise and <Col N="1862" />experience of those involved in planning and conducting joint projects, has been beneficial in the detection of non-compliance and the collection of outstanding PRSI liabilities arising. In addition, the use of both social welfare and revenue legislation has been effective in this regard.</P>
        <P>As a result of the ongoing employer inspection programme, carried out by the JIU and the general social welfare inspectorate, arrears of PRSI/PAYE, totalling &euro;3.86 million and &euro;3.82 million were recovered in respect of the years 2003 and 2004, respectively. Furthermore, to assist inspectors in carrying out this employer inspection programme and to enhance its effectiveness, non-compliant employers are targeted in a number of ways. Arising from the ongoing liaison and co-operation between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, appropriate data are obtained from the Revenue Commissioners which identifies those employers who are failing to meet their legal obligations with regard to the PRSI scheme. Section 222 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1998 provides for the sharing of data between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Such information is issued to the nationwide network of inspectors for follow up action. This involves inspectors conducting wage inspections with a view to regularising the PRSI position and, where appropriate, assessing and collecting outstanding PRSI liabilities.</P>

Underspends on the following heads contributed to the amount to be surrendered: A, administration; E, unemployment assistance; F, farm assist scheme; G, employment support services; I, one-parent family payment; J, widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s and orphan&rsquo;s non-contributory pensions; L, family income supplement; N, supplementary welfare allowance; P, free schemes; Q, the money advice and budgeting service; R, the Family Support Agency; S.2, social exclusion programme and U, miscellaneous services.</P>
        <P>The expenditure for each of the main schemes operated by my Department is demand led and the underspends therefore represent a lower than expected demand in 2004.

        <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and are receiving payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The allowance was first introduced in 1977 and the payment rate at the time was £1 per week. The allowance is not a payment in its own right but a supplement to an Irish social welfare pension or other payment. As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or those whose pension payments are made under the social security regimes of other countries.</P>
        <P>The allowance was last increased in 1996. The policy with regard to support for pensioners since then has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates for all pensioners, rather than supplementary payments such as the living alone allowance. This approach ensures that the position of all our pensioners is improved.</P>

        <P>As indicated in a previous reply, it has always been an objective of my Department to aim to provide quality customer service in Irish. This includes provision for translation of forms, leaflets and other documents; training of staff in spoken and written Irish and providing bilingual signage in public areas.</P>
        <P>To date in 2005, &euro;8,504 has been spent on Irish translation, &euro;3,176 on Irish advertising and &euro;30,173 on bilingual signage. It is estimated that expenditure on Irish training in 2005 will be &euro;131,000 and &euro;64,500 on bilingual signage.

        <P>Rent supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. In general, people in full-time education are excluded from receiving assistance, including rent supplement, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, there is provision for continued payment of rent supplement to eligible long-term social welfare recipients who wish to resume full-time education in approved courses through the back to education allowance or VTOS schemes, subject to satisfying the other standard conditions of the rent supplement scheme. Otherwise, there is no provision whereby a person in full-time education can qualify.</P>
        <P>The Dublin north-east area of the Health Service Executive has advised that, in the course of a routine review of her entitlements, it became aware that the person concerned is a full-time student. As she is not participating in either the back to education allowance or VTOS schemes, she does not satisfy the conditions for continued payment of rent supplement. She has been informed by the executive, therefore, her rent supplement entitlement will cease in the event that she resumes full-time education next September.</P>

        <P>My Department issued over 6.7 million cheques in 2004, of which 16,428 remained uncashed at their expiry date. Cheques issued by my Department can be cashed anytime up to six months after the date of issue. The reason <Col N="1866" />cheques remained uncashed at their expiry date was because they had been lost, stolen, destroyed or were not cashed by customers or traders neglected to redeem them. In cases where my Department was satisfied that the original cheque had not been cashed by the customer or the value redeemed by the trader, replacement cheques were issued to them. A total of 8,732 replacement cheques were issued in 2004.</P>
        <P>Cheques are but one of a range of payment methods offered to customers and account for about 10% of total payments issued by my Department. Departmental cheques are drawn on the Bank of Ireland and may be cashed at any bank branch on production of necessary identification. In addition, Bank of Ireland has an agreement with An Post whereby social welfare cheques may be cashed at any post office subject to satisfactory proof of identity.</P>

        <P>Diet supplements are provided for under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The amount of supplement payable is subject to a means test and depends on which of two categories of diet &mdash; low cost or high cost &mdash; has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical adviser and the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
        <P>The southern region of the executive has advised that the person concerned had been in receipt of a diet supplement of &euro;44.20 per month &mdash; equivalent to &euro;10.20 per week &mdash; in respect of a low cost, low fat diet, in addition to his invalidity pension of &euro;264.40 per week from my Department.

        <P>The executive subsequently reviewed the rate of diet supplement payable to him to take account of the increase of &euro;30.90 in his weekly pension income.

        <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with seven countries:<?oasys _jy?>Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Qu&eacute;bec on 1 October 1994. All of these agreements are currently in operation.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreements apply. With Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, they have limited application as the EU regulations apply in most cases.</P>
        <P>The bilateral agreements provide for the adding together of periods of insurance and, where appropriate, periods treated as equivalent to periods of insurance, completed in Ireland and the other country involved, for the purposes of calculating and awarding pensions. They also provide that temporarily posted workers may continue for a specified period under the social insurance system of the country in which they were previously insured instead of transferring for a short period into the other country&rsquo;s system.</P>
        <P>Liaison procedures have been established with each country and are kept under constant review. Regular contact is made with the appropriate for<Col N="1868" />eign agencies to ensure the smooth transfer of the necessary information required to decide on these types of claims. At present, no significant difficulties are being experienced with any of the agreements.</P>
        <P>For all schemes, the time taken to process claims that fall to be examined under bilateral agreements is longer than that for standard Irish entitlements, reflecting the added complexity that arises in determining entitlements under these agreements. While every effort is made to minimise processing times, the overriding objective in dealing with these claims is to ensure that people receive their full entitlements.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that delays in processing applications will not result in any losses to pensioners and those who qualify for payment will have their claims backdated fully in accordance with the normal regulations for backdating pension claims. I am satisfied that, overall, the procedures are working effectively and efficiently.</P>

        <P>There are 15,503 families currently in receipt of the supplement. The number of persons who applied for family income supplement in the year to December 2004 was 21,020, which represents a substantial increase on 2003 when the numbers of applications received was 18,164. The number received in 2002 was 17,868. The number of persons in receipt of family income supplement at 31 December 2004 was 14,727, with an average weekly payment of &euro;69.68. The number of persons who were in receipt of family <Col N="1869" />income supplement in each of the three previous years was: 2002 &mdash; 12,043; 2003 &mdash; 12,317 and 2004 &mdash; 14,727.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years, improvements to the scheme have been made, particularly with regard to the income limits that apply. This year, I provided for further increases in the family income supplement income limits with effect from January 2005. These increases raised the weekly limit by &euro;39.00 at each point, adding an additional &euro;24.00 to the payments of most existing family income supplement recipients. A minimum weekly rate of &euro;20 applies.</P>
        <P>Additionally, my Department undertakes a number of proactive measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to family income supplement. These include advice to all persons who are awarded one-parent family payment and back to work allowance recipients. All employers are provided annually with information about the scheme in PRSI mailshots.</P>
        <P>Information on family income supplement is contained in all child benefit books and can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website. The scheme has previously been extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers and radio, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots. These methods of information provision will continue to be used to promote the scheme.</P>

        <P>My Department administers a number of child income support measures, including child benefit which delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family regardless of income levels or employment status. Child benefit supports all children but delivers proportionately more assistance to those on low incomes and with larger families. It is not intended primarily to meet child care costs. However, the substantial increases in benefit in recent years can make a significant contribution to meeting those costs.</P>
        <P>Since April 2005, monthly rates of child benefit have increased to &euro;141.60 in respect of each of the first two children and &euro;177.30 in respect of the third and subsequent children. Monthly rates of child benefit have increased by &euro;103.51 at the lower rate and &euro;127.78 at the higher rate since 1997, increases of 272% and 258% respectively. This level of increase is unprecedented and is in line with the Government&rsquo;s objective of improving income for children generally. The question of further increases in child benefit would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department have had discussions with the Departments of Justice, <Col N="1870" />Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science and the Health Service Executive to identify and put in place suitable funding arrangements consistent with the limited, but socially important, responsibility which my Department currently has in this area.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>In recent years, the Government has introduced a number of specific measures which benefit widows and widowers. With regard to those who are over 66 years of age, the Government had committed to bringing their rate of payment into line with that of the old age contributory pension. This was achieved through a series of special increases in recent budgets and the process was completed in budget 2004.</P>
        <P>The maximum rate of both old age and widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s contributory pension is now &euro;179.30 per week. Overall, since 1997, this payment has increased by &euro;89.02 or 98%. The increase in the consumer price index over the same period was 30.7%. Payments for those under 66 years increased by over 70% in the same period.</P>
        <P>Widows and widowers are also benefiting from the changes in the household benefits scheme <Col N="1871" />announced over a number of budgets. Under these arrangements, all persons aged over 70 years of age are now entitled to the full range of benefits, regardless of their means or household composition. Widows and widowers with dependent children can benefit from the widowed parent grant introduced in 2000 to provide additional assistance following a bereavement. The grant is currently valued at &euro;2,700 and is paid in addition to the usual after death payments.</P>
        <P>Increases in the rates of child benefit are also of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased dramatically. Since April, child benefit payments are &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first and second children and &euro;177.30 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
        <P>Increases in payment supports for widows and widowers have more than covered increases in living costs in recent years. I will continue to look for opportunities to improve their position and, in this regard, the various provisions for widows and widowers under the social welfare code will be kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

        <P>The person concerned had her entitlement to lone parent allowance terminated on the grounds of cohabitation. It is a condition for the receipt of lone parent allowance that the lone parent is not cohabiting, that is, living with someone as husband and wife. She subsequently appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. Following an oral hearing, the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer with regard to cohabitation.</P>
        <P>If the circumstances of the person concerned have changed, it is open to her to re-apply for one-parent family payment. Under social welfare legislation, decisions with regard to claims must be made by deciding officers. Appeals against such decisions are decided by appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>Deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit is a payment made to a woman deserted by her husband. Entitlement to payment is based on social insurance contributions paid by the wife or her husband. An earnings limit was introduced for deserted wives benefit in 1992. The limit, which <Col N="1873" />applied only to new claims after August 1992, is currently &euro;12,697.38 a year &mdash; gross earnings. Where earnings are in excess of &euro;12,697.38 a year, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit, provided gross earnings do not exceed &euro;17,776.33 a year.</P>
        <P>Following the introduction of the one-parent family payment in 1997, the deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit scheme was closed to new applications with effect from 2 January in that year. A parent with dependent children is eligible for benefits under the one-parent family payment scheme, irrespective of gender or the circumstances that gave rise to the lone parenthood. Lone parents are encouraged under the scheme to maximise their income from different sources and the means test for the scheme makes provision for the exemption of earnings and maintenance payments.</P>
        <P>With regard to employment, lone parents may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of &euro;293.00 per week. In addition, transitional arrangements can apply for parents who have been in receipt of the one-parent family payment for more than a year. If these recipients&rsquo; weekly income exceeds the upper income limit, they can still retain half their payment for an additional six months. Lone parents are also eligible to avail of the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department.</P>
        <P>The schemes for deserted wives under social insurance have been retained to the extent that existing entitlements already acquired before August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and before 1997, when the one-parent family payment scheme was introduced, have been preserved. All new claimants, irrespective of gender or previous claims and entitlements, who seek income support as lone parents are treated equally under the terms of the one-parent family payment scheme.</P>

        <P>Section 47(4) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 sets out the circumstances under which a person may be disqualified from entitlement to unemployment benefit. One such circumstance relates to customers who receive a redundancy lump sum payment, which, in accordance with the terms of the Redundancy Payment Acts, is in excess of &euro;19,046.07.</P>
        <P>In accordance with this legislation, any person, provided he or she is under age 55, who has received a redundancy payment from his or her <Col N="1874" />employer in excess of &euro;19,046.07, shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks from the last date of employment. The actual duration of the disqualification is a matter for the deciding officer but the guidelines recommend that the length of the disqualification be linked to the size of the redundancy payment in each case.</P>
        <P>Certain payments are disregarded in determining the duration of the disqualification, for example, encashment of pension entitlements where the person has paid into an insurance fund on a voluntary basis, moneys paid in lieu of notice or accrued holiday entitlements. The guidelines also advise that in considering an unemployment benefit claim made by a person who has just been made redundant, account should be taken of a range of factors which could include, for example, the claimant&rsquo;s age, family difficulties and so forth.</P>
        <P>In addition, in cases where the customer intends to use some of the redundancy payment to clear or reduce debts which have accrued, deciding officers may offset these debts against the amount received before determining an appropriate period of disqualification, for example, arrears of mortgage or rent, arrears of telephone/electricity/gas bills and particularly debts to moneylenders. Regard may similarly be had to costs related to any exceptional needs.</P>

        <P>My Department provides people receiving social welfare payments with a choice of payment options. People who choose payment of pensions by electronic fund transfer &mdash; EFT &mdash; to personal bank accounts do so on a voluntary basis. The majority of those who opt for the EFT facility do so at the start of their claim and are paid on a regular weekly basis once their claim is put into payment.</P>
        <P>At present, customers who opt to change from payable order book to EFT move to a different payment cycle as a result. To address this issue, payments for pension customers paid by EFT were changed from two weeks to one week in arrears in November 2004. The full alignment of EFT payments with that of other payment methods, including the elimination of the week in arrears payment, is something which I am anxious to progress and the necessary arrangements will be made in the near future.</P>

        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person&rsquo;s means and their needs. Where a person has access to resources, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>From 10 April 2000, asylum seekers have been provided with full board accommodation, including meals and other services, under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In this situation, they receive a weekly allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child to provide for personal requisites.</P>
        <P>Asylum seekers who applied for asylum before 26 July 1999 but whose cases had not been decided and people who have been given permission to remain in Ireland on the basis of being the parent/s of Irish born children are entitled to seek employment. In addition, any person who has been through the asylum process and has been granted refugee status can also seek employment. If these people are unable to secure work, they will qualify for unemployment or other social assistance from my Department on the same basis as any Irish resident, subject to the normal eligibility conditions. Applications made after May 2004 are subject to the statutory habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>The executive has discretion, within the rules of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, to make an exceptional needs payment to any person, including an asylum seeker, on a once-off basis if he or she has a special need or expense which he or she is unable to meet from his or her own resources. Such payments typically relate to public transport costs for interviews, equipment for a child, small household items and so forth.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there have been stories from time to time that asylum seekers and refugees are in receipt of special payments through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for high cost items such as cars. These reports are without foundation; in so far as it is possible to identify the individual cases about which the allegations were made, no such payments are, or have ever <Col N="1876" />been, made for that purpose through the scheme or through any other social welfare support system. More generally, no special grants or payments are issued under the scheme to any group of people on social or cultural grounds.</P>
        <P>With regard to these stories, it is relevant to note that the majority of non-nationals currently residing in the State are not asylum seekers or refugees. They are mainly EU citizens or people from other parts of the world who have been granted work permits and who are in employment. There are also significant numbers of non-nationals who are studying in this country. Whether studying or working, they are people with their own financial resources to meet their own needs with regard to their living expenses, accommodation, car purchase and so forth without any recourse to the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>Unfounded racist stories or taunts of the sort referred to by the Deputy in his question are always unacceptable. They serve only to hinder the development of mutual understanding and acceptance among the increasingly diverse range of people that comprise Irish society today.</P>

        <P>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. The scheme allows up to 20 years to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension as the standard qualifying conditions relating to the type and number of contributions paid or credited must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>The scheme was looked at in the context of a phase one review of qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. That review suggested a number of developments for the scheme, including backdating to an earlier date and replacing the disregard system with actual pension credits. The conclusions of that report are being examined in more detail but the suggestion with regard to backdating does give rise to significant costs as well as complex issues <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other groups excluded from social insurance cover at different times.</P>
        <Col N="1877" />
        <P>The Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults &mdash; age 66 years or over &mdash; to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension and a number of special increases have been given over several budgets in pursuit of this target. In addition, since October 2002, new pension claimants can opt to have the part of the payment in respect of their spouse or partner paid direct to that person.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>At the end of 2004, there were 33,823 people aged 65 and over in receipt of a qualified adult allowance on either an old age contributory or retirement pension. The estimated cost of increasing the qualified adult allowance to the full rate of the non-contributory pension is &euro;70 million.</P>
        <P>The old age non-contributory pension is a social assistance scheme designed to provide financial support for all older people, whatever their circumstances, who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes, it features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. In this regard, budget 2005 provides for the disregard of the first &euro;20,000 of savings or other assessable assets &mdash; such as shares or bonds &mdash; when means are being assessed. The operation of the means test is kept under review and changes are made as required.</P>

        <P>The Pensions Board was established in December 1990 under the Pensions Act 1990. The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Acts, as amended, relating to occupational pensions and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to its functions and on matters relating to pensions generally. The current Pensions Board term of office will finish in December 2005. The method of selection to the board is mainly by nomination by representative bodies as laid down in the Pensions Act.</P>
        <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act 1986. The main functions of the agency are to advise the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning with regard to poverty, to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty. The term of office of the staff representative on the board of the Combat Poverty Agency is due to expire on 4 December 2005. The replacement will be selected by the staff of the agency. No other vacancies are expected between now and 31 December 2005.</P>
        <P>Comhairle was established on 12 June 2000 under the provisions of the Comhairle Act 2000. Comhairle is responsible for supporting the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for citizens throughout the country, including people with disabilities. Seven vacancies fall due later this year as a result of these members reaching, including the chairman, the end of their term of office.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency was established on 6 May 2003, under the Family Support Agency Act 2001. The remit of the agency is to provide a family mediation service; support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and other family supports; support, promote and develop the family and community; undertake research, provide and <Col N="1879" />disseminate information about parenting and family issues and provide advice to the Minister on matters relating to its functions. There are no vacancies expected between now and 31 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body set up in 1982 to deal with cases where entitlement to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute. The tribunal is an independent agency. The members are appointed by the Minister on foot of nominations by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business Employers Confederation.

These provisions include drainage gullies and sumps, pumping equipment plus power and emergency power arrangements. These installations comply with the prevailing standards and address in full any flooding potential within the tunnel.</P>

        <P>Tachograph recording equipment in passenger vehicles is regulated under the Council Regulations (EEC) No. 3820/85 and Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3821/85 and also S.I. No. 392 and 393 of 1986. These regulations are enforced in respect of buses with a seating capacity of more than 17 persons, including the driver. There are, however, a number of exemptions under both EU regulations, including an exemption for buses on routes which do not exceed 50 kilometres.</P>
        <P>The basic EU rules provide that: after four and a half hours of driving, a driver must take a break of at least 45 minutes; a daily driving period shall not exceed nine hours but may be extended twice in any one week to a maximum of ten hours; in each period of 24 hours, a driver must have a daily rest period of at least 11 consecutive hours and after six days driving, a driver must observe a weekly rest period of 45 hours.</P>
        <P>Tachograph paper based record sheets are used daily by the driver and these record the hours driven, breaks and rest periods. These record sheets are inspected on a regular basis by inspectors from my Department. The enforcement occurs at the premises of operators and at roadside checks. Both operators and drivers have a responsibility to ensure compliance with the regulations and both are prosecuted in the case of non-compliance on drivers&rsquo; hours.</P>
        <P>Passenger vehicles that do not come within the scope of the above regulations are covered by section 114 of the Road Transport Act 1961, No. 24 of 1961, and also article 15 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963, S.I. No. 191 of 1963, applies. These regulations are enforced by the Garda and provide that: a driver shall observe a break of 30 minutes after five and a half hours of driving; it prescribes a driving time of 11 hours and a rest period of ten hours in each period of 24 hours and the regulations of 1963 state that a driver shall observe a weekly rest <Col N="1883" />period of 24 hours after each period of seven days driving.</P>
        <P>The phasing out of analogue tachographs will commence later in the year, to be replaced by digital tachographs which will involve the issue of personalised smart cards to all drivers to replace paper based record sheets.</P>

        <P>In the coming months, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will take delivery of new diesel railcars, which, following a period of commissioning will be introduced into service on the Sligo to Dublin line. When introduced on the Sligo line, they will replace the 30 year old life expired locomotive hauled carriages. From December 2005, the company will increase the frequency of trains between Sligo and Dublin from the current three per day in each direction to five per day in each direction.</P>
        <P>To prepare the way for the introduction of the new rolling stock and the more frequent train service, the infrastructure and stations along the line are being substantially upgraded. All the track on the line has now been relaid with continuous welded rail, the signalling system is currently being renewed with new computer controlled equipment, and each of the stations is being provided with upgraded platforms in line with current safety standards. In total &euro;150 million will have been expended on track, platforms, signalling, stations and trains on the Sligo line by the time the new services commence this coming December.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
        <P>An extensive range of requirements must be satisfied in order to use a bus in a public place. All buses are required to comply with statutory requirements relating to the construction, equipment and use of vehicles as set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996.</P>
        <Col N="1884" />
        <P>Safety standards applied under these regulations relate, <i>inter alia,</i> to maximum passenger accommodation including the circumstances where standing passengers may be carried, maximum dimensions, overall vehicle weight and axle weight limits and the fitment of speed limiters. Notwithstanding the general speed limits that apply to vehicles, single deck buses are subject to a maximum speed limit of 80 km/h with double deck buses subject to a maximum speed of 65 km/h. Buses over one year old are liable to annual roadworthiness testing in accordance with the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 2004.</P>
        <P>In order for a private bus operator to operate a passenger road service, the operator must hold a passenger licence issued by my Department in accordance with the Road Transport Act 1932. One of the requirements to be satisfied for such a licence is that each bus to be used on the proposed route is licensed as a large public service vehicle in accordance with the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002.</P>
        <P>Tachograph recording equipment in passenger vehicles comes under the Council Regulations (EEC) Nos. 3820/85 and 3821/85 and also Statutory Instruments Nos. 392 and 393 of 1986. These regulations are enforced in respect of buses with a seating capacity of more than 17 persons including the driver. Tachograph record-sheets are used daily by the driver and these record the hours driven, breaks and rest periods.</P>
        <P>The basic rules provide that after four and a half hours driving, a driver must take a break of at least 45 minutes. A daily driving period shall not exceed nine hours but may be extended twice in any one week to a maximum of 10 hours. In each period of 24 hours, a driver must have a daily rest period of at least 11 consecutive hours. After six days driving a driver must observe a weekly rest period of 45 hours. The tachograph record-sheets are inspected on a regular basis by inspectors from my Department. The enforcement occurs at the premises of operators and at roadside checks. Both operators and drivers have a responsibility to ensure compliance with the regulations and both are prosecuted in the case of non-compliance on drivers hours.</P>
        <P>All other passenger vehicles that do not come within the scope of the above regulations are covered by section 114 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 and also article 15 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 applies. These regulations are enforced by the Garda and provide that a driver shall observe a break of 30 minutes after five and a half hours driving and a driving time of 11 hours and a rest period of ten hours must be observed in each period of 24 hours. In accordance with regulations of 1963, a driver must observe a weekly <Col N="1885" />rest period of 24 hours after each period of seven days driving.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath have confirmed to my Department that they comply fully with all relevant legislation on drivers, vehicles and health and safety. As with all matters of public importance, my Department receives correspondence concerning these issues from time to time. I am, however, satisfied that the aforementioned regulations and controls provide a framework for a safe, convenient and comfortable bus transport system for both passengers and drivers.</P>

        <P>I am committed to reforming the public transport market in order to provide opportunities for both public and private companies to deliver increased public services and to ensure the taxpayer and the customer gets a high quality of service and best value for money. To this end, I propose to establish an independent national public transport commission to, <i>inter alia,</i> allocate Exchequer subvention for public transport services, both bus and rail, through public service contracts, license commercial bus services and regulate fares on all rail, LUAS and bus services.</P>
        <P>In addition to modernising the regulatory framework, I am currently finalising plans for a major programme of investment in public transport and am considering the structures and arrangements which will need to be put in place to ensure that the best possible return is achieved from this investment. In this context, I am giving consideration to the institutional structure required to ensure the timely, coordinated and integrated delivery of public transport investment in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Work will continue in my Department to identify the best way forward, including the most appropriate arrangements to ensure democratic accountability. However, I envisage that whatever arrangements are put in place will work effectively with the proposed national public transport commission. I should add that operational planning of services will remain with the public transport providers. Officials in my Department are continuing to meet with stakeholders on how to modernise the regulatory structure governing public transport.</P>

        <Quest>further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 40 and 47 of 22 June 2005, the legislative reforms he intends to introduce to counter the numerous successful challenges to road traffic legislation in the courts; when this will happen; and when random breath testing will be provided for in legislation.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
        <P>As I indicated in response to the earlier questions, the current road safety strategy recommends that the introduction of random breath testing should be pursued within its operational timeframe of 2004 to 2006. Against that background I am examining the development of a scheme for a more general basis for roadside testing. The evolution of road traffic legislation is affected by numerous factors, including the outcome of relevant court proceedings.</P>
        <Col N="1887" />
        <P>Allowing for the operation of full random breath testing needs to be considered very carefully. Road traffic legislation, including drink driving legislation, is subjected to challenge from time to time and the interpretation of legislative provisions is ultimately a matter for the courts. As a legislator, I have to seek to ensure that road traffic legislation is sound, robust and reasonable. It is for this reason that I do not intend to pursue any policy initiative in the area of random breath testing until I am satisfied that a more generally applied system of roadside testing provides clear potential for improving road safety on a sustained basis for the future.</P>
        <P>In the meantime the Garda is now empowered to require that all drivers involved in road collisions or detected committing any traffic offences must submit to road-side breath tests. This is in addition to the power to demand that a driver who in the opinion of a garda has consumed alcohol must submit to such a test.</P>

        <P>Every vehicle used for the carriage of passengers for reward is subject to a range of safety measures that includes annual roadworthiness testing. In the case of vehicles with eight or more passenger seats, the roadworthiness tests are carried out by authorised testers appointed by local authorities under regulations made by the Minister for Transport. The regulations transpose EU Directive 96/96 on periodic roadworthiness testing into Irish law. The regulations specify standards for premises, equipment and skills and training of vehicle testers. The items to be tested and the methods of testing are set out in the heavy goods vehicle testers manual or the manual covering light vehicles, as appropriate to the vehicle undergoing test.</P>
        <P>Vehicles with seats for more than eight passengers used for the carriage of passengers for reward are subject to a range of other safety-related measures that includes statutory standards covering construction, equipment, use, lighting, weights and dimensions, a maximum speed limit of 80 km/h, mandatory fitment of a speed limiter device, controls on the numbers of passengers that may be carried, vehicle licensing requirements under the Road Transport Act 1932, driver licensing requirements under the Road Transport Act 1932 and the Road Traffic <Col N="1891" />Acts 1961 to 2004, including maximum permissible driving times.</P>
        <P>It is not obligatory for a transport operator to provide evidence of a roadworthiness certificate in respect of a vehicle to a person seeking to hire the vehicle. However, there would not appear to be a good reason for the operator to decline to provide such evidence if so requested by the hirer.</P>

        <P>My Department has spent approximately &euro;10,000 on the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 to date in 2005. A provisional estimate for translation services for the remainder of 2005 is &euro;12,000. However, this amount may vary depending on the number and length of documents to be translated. It is difficult to give a precise estimate of the total amount that will be spent on all elements relating to the Official Languages Act for the remainder of 2005 as this is dependant on various factors.</P>

        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed me that the DART upgrade project, at &euro;176 million, is the largest investment in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Dublin rail services since the DART services began in 1984, and will deliver a 33% increase in peak capacity on the service by the end of this year, completing a process which will have seen peak capacity on the service doubled since 2000.</P>
        <P>This is being achieved through lengthening platforms to accommodate eight car trains, renewing overhead lines, enhancing the power supply to operate eight car trains, developing sidings to accommodate the expanded fleet, and improving accessibility in stations both for mobility-impaired customers and rail customers generally. In addition to the DART upgrade project, &euro;80 million has been spent on 40 new DART carriages to allow eight car trains to operate.</P>
        <P>Works have been taking place across the DART system since October 2003. In order to minimise the impact on customers, and ensure that the core Monday to Friday service was unaffected, whilst delivering the urgently needed additional capacity as soon as possible, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann designed the work programme to ensure that interruptions to services were confined to weekends, which is off-peak for the DART.</P>
        <P>Existing weekend works on the southside will be completed by mid-September 2005. The cur<Col N="1893" />rent phase of the DART upgrade works which will deliver the facilities for new services are anticipated to be completed by the end of 2005, with completion of minor works and tidy up during January 2006. While allowing for this substantial increase in capacity on each train, this phase of the project will not, and was not intended to, change the frequency or hours of service of the DART trains.</P>

        <P>The gross budgetary allocation of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for 2004 was &euro;309.629 million. The amount returned to the Exchequer at the end of 2004 was &euro;852,000 or 0.28% of the gross allocation. Taking extra appropriations-in-aid receipts into account, the total amount returned to the Exchequer was &euro;3.842 million. The total is made up of the following: extra appropriations-in-aid receipts of &euro;2.99 million &mdash; target figure, &euro;19.998 million; amount received &euro;22.988 million, of which &euro;9.787 million was received in December, &euro;4.731 million on 14 December and &euro;5.056 million on 21 December; saving of &euro;736,000 in the administrative budget of the Department with &euro;150,000 of this amount being made available to my Department in 2005 under the efficiency dividend provisions of the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget agreement &mdash; savings on administration are not available for spending on programme budgets; and a saving of &euro;116,000 on the programme spend of the Department, representing 0.04% of the gross programme budget of &euro;292.052 million.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 373 of 30 Samhain 2004 which sets out the position in so far as my Department&rsquo;s services are concerned. The allocation for Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga for 2005 is &euro;700,000. In so far as my overall responsibility for ensuring that the provisions of the Act are implemented is concerned, the only additional cost incurred to date in 2005 by my Department related to the printing of additional copies of the statutory guidelines published under section 12 of the Act. The cost amounted to &euro;7,431 and was once off.</P>
        <P>While other minor costs of this nature may be incurred by my Department during the remainder of 2005, it is not possible to quantify them at this time.</P>

        <P>Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf involving the disbursement of up to &euro;60 million from the fund.</P>
        <P>An application from the group to which the Deputy referred was received by ADM and evaluated against the criteria set out in the published guidelines. I understand the board decided not to approve the application and that the group was advised of the decision on 15 April 2005. I am advised that the group has requested the board to review its decision. The review is being processed and the outcome should be known shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided in December 2003 to bring forward legislative changes to arrangements for dormant accounts funding. Arising from the decision, the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill was published on 24 June 2004 and became law on 25 May 2005. The Act provides for key changes in decision making on disbursements from the fund and a reconstituted board. Arrangements for future allocations from the fund, which will be subject to the provisions of the amended Act, are under consideration.</P>

        <P>The appeal of the person named was not upheld originally by the agriculture appeals office. It was upheld, however, following a subsequent review of new information received. The agriculture appeals office sent written notification of this to the Cork office of my Department. An Post states that the notification was delivered but no record has been found to date of it having been received by the Cork office. In framing the answer to the parliamentary question of 14 June on the case, therefore, my Department assumed the appeal of the person named had not succeeded. Now that it is aware the appeal succeeded, it is arranging for payment to be made within the next fortnight of the &euro;211.86 due under the 2003 suckler premium scheme and of any other payments due under other schemes as a consequence.</P>
        <P>The agriculture appeals office has agreed to notify the outcome of every appeals decision in future to the relevant office of my Department by e-mail as well as by ordinary mail. In this way, I hope my Department will be able to act swiftly on foot of all successful appeals to pay the farmers concerned any entitlements arising as early as possible. In addition, I have directed my Department to check with the agriculture appeals office in respect of any future parliamentary question relating to appeals cases to ensure replies take into account the final decisions by the appeals office in all cases.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 445, 447, 450, 451, 452, 453, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 465, 467, 468, 470, 471, 477 and 479 together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies are probably aware, the event referred to occurred during July 2002, which is almost three years ago. As the matter is the subject of litigation, it would be inappropriate of me to comment on many of the issues raised in the questions at this point in time as to do so might prejudice the outcome of the litigation or any further action to be taken by my Department or other authorities. However, I can make some general comments on the case.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the decision of my Department to require the slaughter of the pigs outside the food chain was based on the need to protect human health from the consumption of pigmeat containing a carcinogenic substance. As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 162 on 23 June, the case involved the slaughter on farm by the herdowner of some 4,000 pigs over a five day period following the discovery by Department veterinary inspectors of quantities of carbadox on the farm and an admission by the herdowner that he had spread the substance on the floors of pig pens. The movement of any animals from the herd, except under specific licence from the Department, had also been prohibited by the Department in the period preceding slaughter to protect public health. Notwithstanding this, some pigs were moved to slaughter plants and products from some of these did in fact enter the food chain.</P>
        <P>Carbadox is a carcinogen, or cancer-causing substance, which is banned by the EU and deemed to be unsafe at any level. Prosecutions have since been issued against the herdowner, alleging a range of offences relating to the use of this feed additive and other matters including the illegal movement of pigs from the farm. The herdowner has issued proceedings against the <Col N="1904" />Department under two headings. The video, reportedly commissioned by the herdowner, was brought to the attention of my Department by the media and was shown, but not handed over, to a number of Department officials. The video was also shown at a meeting of the farm animal welfare advisory council, FAWAC. My Department requested a copy of the video from the journalist concerned on 17 June but the journalist told an official of my Department that she had been advised by her sources not to provide one. In any event, neither I nor my Department have received it. If it is furnished, it will be reviewed and immediate consideration will be given to what action might be taken in relation to its content.</P>
        <P>While there was no question of legally permitting the pigs to be slaughtered for human consumption, the Department wrote to the herdowner&rsquo;s solicitors on 7 May 2002 explicitly stating its willingness to allow him to pursue the option of his making arrangements, acceptable to the Department, with a dedicated plant for their slaughter. However, he did not pursue this option. Instead, he sought permission to slaughter the pigs himself on his farm on welfare grounds. He had discussed this approach with Department veterinary inspectors and they were satisfied that he understood fully what would be involved and that he displayed both the competence and confidence to undertake the task. During the five day period, two veterinary inspectors, including an animal welfare expert, from the Department visited the farm on numerous occasions to assess the ongoing slaughter operation. A non-veterinary official of the Department was present on the farm during the five day period in question whose primary function was ensuring proper disposal of the carcasses to ensure they did not enter the human food chain. At no point during the slaughter process did the herdowner express concerns or disquiet on animal welfare grounds in relation to the slaughter method or seek to suspend operations on grounds of professed animal welfare concerns.</P>
        <P>An official of my Department observed the herdowner use a lump-hammer to slaughter a small number &mdash; five &mdash; of pigs and ordered the practice to cease immediately. The implement was seized and only returned to the farmer when the entire slaughter process was completed. With regard to the attempted suffocation of the pigs, records indeed show that the herdowner was legally instructed to maximise the ventilation capacity of his units to minimise the negative welfare impact associated with increased live-weight capacity of the units. Department veterinary staff did not report any attempt to deliberatively deprive the pigs of air.</P>
        <P>The circumstances of the case were highly unusual. On-farm slaughter of animals in any number is an exception rather than the rule and occurs only in extreme circumstances, such as those of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Cooley, where it is not possible to move the animals to a dedicated slaughter plant or where <Col N="1905" />there are compelling reasons such as fear of disease spreading for not attempting to so do. In this case, the herdowner had himself decided to slaughter his animals on farm and the Department considered at the time that it could not legally have forced him to have the operation conducted in a slaughter plant. The approach which the Department itself generally employs in circumstances in which it proves necessary to have numbers of animals slaughtered &mdash; as in the case of cattle where BSE is detected &mdash; is to have slaughter carried out in a dedicated slaughter plant.</P>

        <P>The person named submitted ten applications for special beef premium in 2004 in respect of a total of 343 animals. Following computer validation, six animals on the second application, which was received on 6 February 2004, were identified as being under age and, therefore, ineligible for premium on the date of application. The animals have since been deleted from the application. One animal on the tenth application was identified as slaughtered prior to application dated 31 December 2004 and was not eligible for payment. One animal on the same application was also identified as CMMS non-compliant. However, the entry in the CMMS has since been updated and payment made in respect of this animal.</P>
        <P>Payment of interim balancing payments of &euro;9,674.70 in respect of 336 animals issued to the named person on 22 June 2005. As the person named submitted over 25 animals, the special beef overshoot reduction must be applied to the balancing payments under the scheme. The person named applied for 56 animals under the 2004 suckler cow premium scheme and was paid advances of &euro;4,034.70 on 23 November 2004 and &euro;3,496.74 on 7 December 2004. However, a stocking density limit of 1.8 livestock units per hectare of the forage area of the holding applies in respect of the suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes and animals over and above that limit are not paid premium. As a result payment under the suckler cow scheme to the person named was limited to 52.09 animals and the balancing payment of &euro;4,144.53 due in respect of 52.09 cows issued on 22 June 2005.</P>

        <P FLI="0">No samples of imported product were tested for carbadox during the period in question. In this regard the following needs to be borne in mind: Under Single Market rules, a member state is precluded from routinely checking imports either from other member states, or from third countries which have already been cleared into free circulation through another member state: third country exports are allowed into the EU only where the country concerned has satisfied the EU Commission that equivalent guarantees exist, that is, the Commission must be satisfied that the country concerned has in place an equivalent level of consumer protection to that in the EU in terms of legislation and controls. To monitor this, third countries are required to submit annual residue control plans and the results thereof to the Commission: third countries are subject to on-the-spot inspections by inspectors from the Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary office to verify the existence and effectiveness of controls. Where deficiencies are found, the Commission can and does implement sanctions which can result in the approval to export to the EU being rescinded or implements safeguard decisions under which member states are obliged to carry out testing on product imported from the country in question: the effectiveness of routine testing of product from third countries for residues is in many cases <Col N="1908" />of limited effectiveness since the product imported, typically muscle meat, is often not the optimum matrix in which to detect the substance or metabolite in question, bearing in mind also depletion during transport.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s national residue monitoring programme is drawn up to protect public health and to meet obligations in this regard under EU Directive 96/23. The annual programmes for the years 2001-2004 have been examined and approved by the EU Commission and the programme for 2005 is currently going through the EU approval process.</P>
        <P>The test method used is based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, GCMS, technology. This is an internationally recognised method for the purpose of testing for carbadox and meets relevant scientific criteria in terms of confirmation, accuracy and repeatability.</P>

        <P>In general, the single payment scheme is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during all or any of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid livestock premia and-or arable aid payments in one or more of those years and who, or whose successors, will farm in 2005 single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department has been aware, from an early stage in the negotiations leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme, of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings during the reference years 2000 to 2002. In so far as it has proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision has been made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.</P>
        <P>Where an individual had retired before the reference period, that person is not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. However, a concession agreed with the European Commission will allow family members who take over a holding that was leased to third parties during the reference period to have access to entitlements from the national reserve. This will benefit the family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming.</P>
        <P>My officials are continuing to discuss with EU Commission officials the position of retired farmers in the context of the new single payment scheme.</P>

        <P>My Department operates an official bovine tuberculosis, TB, eradication programme through which farmers contribute by means of the payment of bovine disease levies on animals slaughtered and milk sold to co-operatives. In common with many other diseases my Department does not operate an official programme for the eradication of tuberculosis in farmed deer and therefore there is no compensation payable in respect of TB infected deer. There are no mandatory programmes at EU level dealing with the eradication of tuberculosis in deer. It is fair to say that most of the scientific publications concerning TB in deer originate in New Zealand, where deer farmers actively fund and participate in their TB eradication programme.</P>
        <P>Advice on disease control measures and bio-security is available from the local Department district veterinary office, DVO, and the relevant Department regional veterinary research laboratory. The Department is aware that in some instances deer farmers have organised to pay for TB testing in their own herds through their private veterinary practitioner.</P>
        <P>In the early 1990s, the Department offered a TB eradication programme to deer farmers on the basis that the programme would be self financing by the industry along the lines of the TB eradication programme for bovines. This programme would have required the registration of holdings with farmed deer and their individual identification. At that time the industry declined to participate in the programme on the terms offered by this Department. My Department will keep its policy in this area under review but has no immediate plans to introduce an official TB eradication programme for farmed deer.</P>

        <P>The Department&rsquo;s voted budget provision for 2004 was &euro;1,405 million, gross. At the end of 2004, unspent budget amounted to &euro;146.2 million.

        <P>Most of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure relates to demand led schemes, animal disease control measures and technical and financial costs relating to intervention.

        <P>In appointing persons to the boards under my aegis, I follow the guidelines set out in the Cabinet handbook regarding eligibility, transparency and gender balance. The Department of Finance, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, has been considering whether tax clearance certificates can and should be required of those being considered for appointment to State boards. Based on the outcome of that process, further consideration will be given as to whether any changes to the existing arrangements is appropriate or not.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to vacancies on boards of statutory or State bodies under the aegis of my Department is as follows. There are currently no vacancies on the board of An Bord Bia. Four vacancies will arise in the ordinary membership of the board of An Bord Bia between now and 31 December 2005. These vacancies will occur on the expiry of the terms of office of four members, all of whom are eligible for re-appointment.</P>
        <P>On Coillte Teoranta, the period of appointment of the current worker representative expired on the 13 May 2005. Therefore a vacancy currently exists on the board. There is a long-standing arrangement concerning worker representation on the Coillte Teoranta board of directors, which rotates between IMPACT and SIPTU, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been asked by this Department to forward the names of two nominees to fill the current vacancy.</P>
        <P>There is at present one vacancy on the board of the National Milk Agency. Except for the chairmanship, I do not have discretion in the filling of places on the board of the agency. Producer members are elected by the registered producers, while representatives of the other sectors are nominated by various interest groups.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant improvements in the provision of supports for the development of child care over the last number of years. Child care was identified as an investment priority under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
        <P>The equal opportunities child care programme has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents, in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, education and training. It aimed to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 55% &mdash; some 31,000 places &mdash; by its end and I am happy to report that this target has been surpassed.</P>
        <P>Child care services, including playgroups, which address social policy objectives in relation to employment are eligible to apply, in line with the programme criteria, for funding from my Department. Playgroups are generally sessional in nature and under the programme would be expected to open for at least 46 weeks in a year, offering a service five days per week. In addition, sessional playgroups are encouraged to provide two sessions per day to maximise the use of the facility and to provide flexibility of access to child care for parents. It is important to note that all services applying under the programme are encouraged to provide as wide a range of child care as is possible.</P>
        <P>The positive impact the programme is having on flexible access to child care is illustrated by a recently published 2004 survey of more than 1,000 grant recipients. The survey was compiled for my Department by ADM Limited, which carries out the day-to-day management of the programme on my behalf. The 2004 survey showed that 36.1% of services funded under the programme operated for 40 hours per week or more. It also indicated that the average operating hours of services was 33.4 hours per week, which was an increase from an average of 31.7 hours in 2003. It is interesting to note in the survey that 38.2% of facilities which received funding under the programme operated full day care services and that 33.4% of facilities provided a sessional service of two sessions per day. The survey also indicates that some services provide more than one category of child care and may provide a mix of full day, sessional and school age child care.</P>
        <P>Total funding committed since the programme commenced in 2000 is over &euro;444 million, of which over &euro;389 million has been allocated to child care facilities. This includes &euro;45.6 million which I announced last Wednesday, 22 June 2005. The funding under the programme addresses the development of child care from capital, staffing and quality improvement perspectives. It is worth <Col N="1917" />noting that, in addition to large-scale capital allocations, the programme has committed substantial funding to staffing grant assistance. Support towards the staffing costs of employing child care workers in community-based child care centres in disadvantaged areas ensures that less advantaged parents in those areas have increased access to quality child care and that they are charged fees which are less than the economic cost of providing the service.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the total funding allocated to child care facilities will lead to the creation of some 39,900 new child care places. Of these new places, I am delighted to note that 24,600 were already in place by December 2004.

        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the community-based group in question was awarded staffing grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme, EOCP, 2000-2006, of &euro;36,000 over three years in May 2002 and a further &euro;24,000 over two years in September 2002. This brings the total staffing allocation approved for the group to &euro;60,000, which was considered to be a sufficient contribution for the level of service being provided.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the group was informed by the child care directorate of my Department that staffing grant assistance will be maintained until 31 August 2005, at the current levels, for groups in receipt of staffing grant assistance for three or more years and subject to the groups&rsquo; maintaining their approved level of service and implementing any conditions associated with the development of the service.</P>
        <P>Following a detailed review of the existing staffing grants under the EOCP, I recently extended the terms of the grants to the end of December 2007 to groups which have received staffing grants for a period of three or more years and which continue to deliver a child care service in accordance with their pre-agreed targets. To benefit from such funding, the groups must continue to pay particular attention to the support of disadvantaged families and the implementation of a fee structure tailored to the differing financial circumstances of the client group and which ensures that child care places subsidised by the EOCP are targeted towards those most in need.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>A consultation process on my proposals for a Bill to streamline and modernise the liquor licensing laws by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004 and replacing them with updated provisions more suited to modern conditions has recently concluded. I will take account of the views of organisations and individuals who responded to my request for submissions in the context of drafting the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of public concerns regarding alcohol-related harm in our society and my proposals contain both safeguards and increased penalties that are intended to combat such harm. These include: requiring all planning authorities to address the regulation and control of the location of licensed premises in their development plans; requiring applicants for retail licences, including off-sales licences, to present proof of planning permission and certification of compliance with planning conditions and fire safety standards to the District Court; extending the jurisdiction of the District Court to all retail licences and giving specified notice to parties, including the health authority and members of the public, the right to object to the grant of a licence; streamlining the system for renewing licences and clarifying the right of members of the public to object to renewal in any particular case on stated grounds; strengthening provisions designed to combat sales to under-age persons by, for example, requiring all off-sales premises to have written policies and control procedures; supplementing existing offences relating to under-age consumption of alcohol with a new offence of being in possession of a forged Garda age card; and increasing the levels of penalties and sanctions, including a proposal that all temporary closure orders should involve closure for a minimum of two days.</P>
        <P>My proposals will also allow the Garda to object to applications for new retail licences on the grounds of an undue risk of public nuisance or a threat to public order or safety. In addition, the proposed Bill will contain provisions for dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises, as well as combating the sale and supply of alcohol to under-age persons.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I am taking a number of initiatives to strengthen the powers available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat public order offending and anti-social behaviour which are often related to abuse of alcohol. I have proposed a fixed charge procedure regarding certain public order offences in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is awaiting Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Section 29 of the Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Public <Col N="1919" />Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to certain public order offences under that Act. The procedure will apply to an offence under section 4 &mdash; intoxication in public place &mdash; and section 5 &mdash; disorderly conduct in a public place. It is intended that the fixed penalty procedure will be an alternative to criminal proceedings being taken in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that people, particularly the elderly, feel threatened by forms of harassment which of themselves may not be criminal offences but which may cause distress. I intend to include in the Criminal Justice Bill a provision which will empower the Garda to apply to the courts, by way of civil procedure, for an anti-social behaviour order.</P>
        <P>The obligation to produce an age document in order to gain admission to the bar of licensed premises is intended to assist licensees to comply with legislative provisions relating to underage consumption of alcohol and to assist the Garda in enforcing the law.</P>
        <P>The national age card scheme was initiated in April 1999 under the provisions of section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. The scheme was introduced to help curb the growth in underage drinking by introducing a specially designed age card. Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by regulations provide for the issue of an age card to those who have attained 18 years of age and are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase and consume alcohol in licensed premises. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999 set out detailed provisions in respect of the application and authentication procedure as well as procedures for the preparation and issue of age cards. To date, more than 181,000 cards have been issued by the Garda authorities.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licenses, late night clubs and food premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Encounter, which commenced nationwide in 2002, is designed to address specifically public disorder, underage drinking and other related issues, and targets key offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1997 and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, particularly offences committed by, or on behalf of, persons under 18 years.</P>
        <P>The Garda secondary school programme has been introduced as part of the social, personal and health education programme for second level <Col N="1920" />students. One module in this programme deals with substance abuse and incorporates the various issues relating to alcohol use and abuse.</P>

        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Malin Garda station as at 28 June 2005 was two &mdash; all ranks. The sergeant attached to Malin Garda station retired from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 2 June 2005.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management reports that available resources are deployed to provide the most effective police service for the area. There is a sergeant in Carndonagh, four miles from Malin, and a sergeant in Clonmany, 12 miles from Malin.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the divisional officer for Donegal to allocate personnel within the division. I am advised that every effort is made to fill vacancies at sergeant rank arising as a result of retirements or promotions, in conjunction with the allocation of newly promoted sergeants. The situation will be kept under review and when the next group of newly promoted sergeants is being deployed the needs of Donegal division will be fully considered.</P>
        <P>On Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context the needs of Donegal division will be fully considered with the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and <Col N="1921" />a large number of public order offences, but it will also be possible to address other priorities, such as the need to increase very significantly the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

        <P>The person was granted a multiple re-entry visa valid until 10 October 2005 on 1 November 2004. When this entry visa expires, it is open to the person to apply for a further multiple re-entry visa for a period of up to two years. The Deputy should note that it is possible to make applications for such a visa by post. The re-entry visa requirements for holders of valid registration cards will be reviewed by my Department in the context of the forthcoming Immigration and Residence Bill.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>There are four ways in which a person born outside Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship, namely: by means of a grant as a token of honour; by descent; by naturalisation; or by marriage to an Irish citizen, that is, post-nuptial citizenship. It is assumed, for the purposes of this reply, that neither honorary citizenship nor citizenship by descent are relevant in this context. Accordingly, I will set out some general information about naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship. However, without further details, I am not in a position to advise as to which method is appropriate to the circumstances of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>On post-nuptial citizenship, a non-national married to a person who is an Irish citizen, otherwise than by naturalisation, post-nuptial declaration or honorary citizenship, may accept Irish citizenship as his/her post-nuptial citizenship by lodging a declaration not earlier than the three years from the date of the marriage or three years from the date on which the applicant&rsquo;s spouse became an Irish citizen, whichever is the later. The marriage must be subsisting and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of the lodgment of the declaration.</P>
        <P>The continued availability of this process is finite. That is because it was repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001. However, it remains open to non-nationals who married prior to 30 November 2002 and who fulfil the statutory conditions, namely, three years marriage, etc. This window of opportunity will cease with effect from 29 November 2005. Persons who marry on or after 30 November 2002 or those who married prior to that date but who do not avail of the post-nuptial process prior to 29 November 2005 must apply for naturalisation in accordance with the provisions relating thereto.</P>
        <P>With regard to naturalisation, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish national, those conditions are that the applicant must be: of full age; of good character; married to the Irish citizen for at least three years; in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting; living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency on the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declar<Col N="1926" />ation, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>In other cases the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation providing that certain, more rigorous, statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be: of full age or, by way of exception, a minor born in the State; of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that, in the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>

        <P>On 16 May the Commissioner initiated Operation Anvil, a special intelligence-led operation within the Dublin Metropolitan Region with additional resources made available to him. The primary focus of this operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity, through extensive additional overt patrolling, and static<?oasys _jy?>checkpoints, by uniformed mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain-clothes patrols.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is in addition to ongoing Garda operations and is not causing them to be scaled back. While Operation Anvil applies to the Dublin region, similar Garda actions are taking place in the rest of the State under existing arrangements. The operation is operating for an initial four month period after which it will be reviewed.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that as a result of the operation, 420 arrests have been <Col N="1928" />made to date and 83 firearms recovered. A number of investigations are ongoing, and investigation files will be submitted for directions to the law officers in due course.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the necessary resources are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 510 to 519, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On 4 August 2000, Deputy Commissioner Conroy submitted to the Department of Justice a 37 page synopsis of the Carty investigation file which had been submitted the previous month to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>At that stage, in addition to the consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions of criminal prosecutions, there were Donegal-related civil proceedings under way, and Donegal-related complaints with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complaints board.</P>
        <P>On 22 May 2001, the former Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, wrote to me in my role as Attorney General on the allegations of criminal and unethical behaviour by some garda&iacute; in Donegal. He made clear that he wanted to see the truth of the matter determined. He was of the view that the nature of the Donegal situation was such that it required a comprehensive review that would examine and report on all aspects without interfering with potential civil and criminal proceedings. In this regard, the Minister said that he would be pleased to have the benefit of the Attorney General&rsquo;s preliminary advice as to whether he, the Minister, could proceed with any such examination, be it a sworn inquiry or otherwise, while civil and criminal proceedings were pending.</P>
        <P>As Attorney General I replied with advice on 25 June 2001, making the preliminary point that neither I nor anyone in my office had seen the full report of Assistant Commissioner Carty. I set out the different options and the considerations attaching to each. I acknowledged that the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry was at first sight the most appealing course of action to take. However, my view was that the civil proceedings and criminal prosecutions pending should be allowed to run their course. I also recommended that, in the event of these proceedings being compromised or disposed of without the facts being fully ventilated, a tribunal of inquiry should be established to bring out the facts and to make recommendations. I emphasised that I was advising in the matter without the benefit of seeing the full Carty report, and I expressed the view that it was necessary for the Office of the Attorney General to see the report so as to advise and brief counsel in relation to pending civil actions against the State.</P>
        <P>On 21 November 2001 those parts of the Carty investigation file that were considered relevant to the civil proceedings arising from the alleged incidents in the Donegal division were received by <Col N="1931" />the Department from the Garda Commissioner. The papers were copied and passed to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and to the legal team representing the State in the civil actions. The full Carty file was given to the Department by the Garda Commissioner in mid-January 2002.</P>
        <P>Also in November 2001, Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, was requested to conduct a review of the papers in the Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to recommending how the matter might best be brought to finality. On 30 January 2002 he submitted his report. Mr. Murphy had access to documentation not seen by the Department or the Attorney General and gave a comprehensive account of the situation. While recognising the need to ensure that civil and criminal proceedings were not compromised, he endorsed the view that &ldquo;a Tribunal of Inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve outstanding issues of fundamental public importance&rdquo;. He included draft terms of reference in his report. These formed the basis of the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal itself when it was established in April 2002.</P>
        <P>In February 2002 the Government approved in principle the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry and the drafting of a Bill to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts to facilitate the holding of an inquiry, allowing a tribunal to hold part of its hearings in private if necessary so as to avoid prejudicing a criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P>At all times both I as the Attorney General and the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, were anxious that the matter should be fully inquired into and that the truth should emerge. The only issue was the possible prejudice to pending or potential criminal proceedings. That difficulty was eventually overcome by amendment of the legislation.</P>
        <P>All the relevant files and papers within my Department, including those requested by the Deputy, have been provided to the tribunal and are now subject to its control and scrutiny.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government is firmly committed to supporting parents with their child care needs through increased capacity, choice and service quality. These aims are the hallmark of the Government&rsquo;s child care strategy. To this end, considerable progress has already been achieved in terms of increasing the supply of quality centre-based child care places and in enhancing the awareness of quality issues across the entire child care sector but with special emphasis on child minders, who are key providers of non-centre-based child care in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that there have been significant improvements in the provision of supports for the development of child care in recent years. Child care was identified as an investment priority under the National Development Plan 2000 &mdash; 2006. This was a direct response to the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 to develop a strategy for the development and delivery of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>The current equal opportunities child care programme, a seven year programme, has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents in reconciling their child care requirements with their participation in employment, education and training. It aims to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55% or some 31,000 places, by the end of the programme and I am happy to report that this target has been surpassed.</P>
        <P>Since it was launched in 2000, the funding for the programme for the 2000 to 2006 period has increased from &euro;317 million to &euro;499.3 million, or by 57%, the most recent increase being &euro;50 million in the budget of 2005. The multi-annual capital envelopes announced that day also included the injection of a further &euro;40 million in additional capital funding into child care between the end of the programme and 2009.</P>
        <P>Total funding committed since the programme commenced in 2000 is over &euro;444 million, of which over &euro;389 million has been allocated to child care facilities. This includes &euro;45.6 million, which I announced last Wednesday, 22 June 2005. It is expected that the total funding allocated to child <Col N="1935" />care facilities will lead to the creation of some 39,900 new child care places. Of these, I am delighted to note that 24,600 new places were already in place by December 2004. These new places offer parents greater access to affordable child care throughout the country as they balance their work and family needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that more than &euro;150 million of the total funding committed has been allocated to staffing grant assistance. This provides support towards the staffing costs of employing child care workers in community-based child care centres in disadvantaged areas, ensuring that less advantaged parents in those areas have increased access to quality child care and that they are charged fees which are less than the economic cost of providing the service.</P>
        <P>New policy initiatives to promote the supply of quality child care are under the remit of my Department and are under consideration on an ongoing basis. The Deputy may be aware that, on 22 June 2005, I launched a new policy initiative on the development of school age child care in Ireland. The report, entitled &ldquo;Developing School Age Child care in Ireland&rdquo;, makes a number of recommendations for the development of school age child care to support the needs of parents, including the use of school premises, where appropriate, as locations to develop a quality school age child care service. It also lays down guidelines for the delivery of a quality school age child care service. It is hoped that the publication of the report and its guidelines will spark local interest in the opportunities that exist to build such facilities. I also announced that I was making further funding available to the city and county child care committees to enable them to publicise the report locally and to identify school management authorities who might be interested in developing a service to complement and link with their school. New policy initiatives, such as this one, will help to ensure that parents have increased access to quality child care.</P>
        <P>The programme also has a focus on many of the quality issues which were identified in the child care strategy and aims to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services throughout the country. I have also allocated more than &euro;55 million to quality improvement measures, including funding to the city and county child care committees, funding to the national voluntary child care organisations, the national childminding initiative and the new partnerships for quality child care initiative.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s record in providing enhanced child care supports is without parallel and I am confident that we are moving rapidly to ensure that there are quality services available to parents throughout the country.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that there would appear to be a number of possible scenarios in the situation described by the Deputy and whether the property in question is registered or unregistered will be of particular relevance. In providing the following information, it is important to note that neither my Department nor the Land Registry has an advisory role in these matters and the person in question may wish to consult a solicitor in order to determine how to proceed.</P>
        <P>If the property in question is unregistered, the safe storage of any documents relating to ownership is entirely a private matter and if lost, destroyed or mislaid there is no organisation which will replace them. While it may be that some party &mdash; possibly a solicitor, bank or building society &mdash; has retained a copy of the deeds for some reason, neither the Land Registry nor the Registry of Deeds has any role in this. I am informed that in such circumstances it is often the <Col N="1937" />practice to lodge an application for first registration with the Land Registry in order to establish title. The practice where one or all original deeds relating to unregistered property are lost or mislaid is, I am advised, comprehensively set out in Fitzgerald&rsquo;s land registry practice and is also covered in the Land Registry&rsquo;s practice direction No. 31, chapter 1 which is available on the Land Registry website at <i>www.landregistry.ie</i> under the section on practice directions.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that if the title to the property is registered, on completion of the registration all original documents are permanently retained by the Land Registry and a folio is opened which is effectively the title to the property. Thereafter no deeds to that title exist. A registered owner is entitled to apply for a certificate of his title, known as a land certificate, which is sometimes referred to as the title deed for registered property. Anyone is entitled to apply for a certified copy folio. However, only one land certificate can be issued. Where a land certificate is lost, an application for a duplicate can be made in accordance with the land registration rules of 1972 and the practice is also set out in Fitzgerald&rsquo;s land registry practice and is also covered in the Land Registry&rsquo;s practice direction No. 16, which is also available on the Land Registry website at <i>www.landregistry.ie </i>under the section on practice directions.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State solely on that basis. Non-EU national spouses of Irish citizens who marry abroad and who are visa-required nationals must apply for a visa to enter the State.</P>
        <P>Applications for permission to remain in the State on the sole basis of marriage to an Irish national are not divided into those who marry outside the State and those married in Ireland. In 2004 the total number granted permission to remain in the State on this basis was 255. To 31 May this year, 83 have been granted residency on this basis. Figures available show that from 1 January 2001 to 31 May 2005 a total of 144 have been refused permission to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish national.</P>
        <Col N="1938" />
        <P>The immigration division of my Department has growing experience of marriages being entered into for the sole purpose of enabling the non-national in question gain entry to, or remain in, the State. Frequently in these circumstances the Irish national may be totally unaware that this is the intention of the non-national and will feel aggrieved by the perception that the immigration authorities are interfering with his or her private life in refusing to allow a spouse to enter or remain in the State. On occasion, the Irish national may be a willing party for his or her own personal benefit. So-called convenience marriages, for the purpose of circumventing normal immigration controls, are experienced by immigration jurisdictions worldwide and, in this regard, holiday and Internet romances would feature frequently.</P>
        <P>In order to prevent abuses of the immigration system, in so far as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish citizen&rsquo;s private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish various facts. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. It is a requirement of my Department that the non-EU national spouse of an Irish national is residing in the same household, in a family unit with the Irish national in order to acquire residency solely on this basis. This may involve requesting supporting documentation as evidence of the relationship or an interview by the immigration authorities of either or both parties.</P>
        <P>Applications of the type referred to by the Deputy are dealt with in chronological order, in the interests of fairness to all other applicants and currently take approximately sixteen months to process. The resources allocated to process such applications are dependent on the prioritised work requirements of the immigration division of my Department at any one time, which is operating against a background of significant increases in demands for its services over a wide range of areas, including the type of applications referred to here.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s primary concern in this matter is to maintain the integrity of the immigration system.</P>

        <P>The connect project was launched in 2000 as a part of the prison service training and development programme, amount<Col N="1939" />ing to &euro;58 million under the national development plan. The funding involved is provided annually by the Exchequer as part of the prisons Vote. There is no separate budget for this programme. Expenditure since 2000 has been on funding salary and incidental costs incurred in providing vocational training in the prisons, as well as meeting the cost of some capital works and materials used in the manufacture of products in prison workshops for the Special Olympics in 2003.</P>
        <P>The connect projects at Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and the training unit were established with the support of the national training and development institute, NTDI, and are now capable of independent operation. A process of internal review during 2002 prompted a refocusing of the project, prior to its roll-out to further institutions. In particular, the review identified the need for new management structures in order to better support the project&rsquo;s sentence management processes in the delivering institutions. Following this internal review, roll-out of the project commenced at Limerick Prison but was subsequently put on hold against the background of the current industrial relations and attendant financial difficulties.</P>
        <P>The connect project has now resumed roll-out at Limerick Prison with renewed NTDI support and the projects at Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and the training unit, which have been affected by the current industrial relations and financial restrictions, will resume full operation when there is a successful outcome to the industrial relations process.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 534 and 535 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that applications for Garda CCTV systems in<?oasys _jy?>Malahide and Swords have been received by the CCTV advisory committee. This committee was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters relating to CCTV systems. These applications are currently under consideration by the advisory committee along with applications from other towns throughout the country. However, it should be noted that there are currently approved plans for 17 Garda CCTV systems nationwide, six of which have been or are being installed. These will have to be completed prior to the initiation of future Garda CCTV projects.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the CCTV programme and reduce, as far as possible, the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. The opportunity should be taken to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. To that end, the Commissioner has been asked to submit proposals for the installation of CCTV in <Col N="1941" />the outstanding 11 locations in the current phase, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006. It is, understandably, not possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. With this in mind, I launched the community-based CCTV scheme earlier this month in response to the demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland, such as Swords and Malahide, for the provision of CCTV systems. The purpose of the scheme is to support local communities who wish to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.</P>
        <P>The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations, towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. Under this scheme, individual communities will be able to avail of grant aid funding of up to &euro;100,000 from my Department to install a CCTV system in their area.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to say that further to discussions between our respective Departments, my colleague, the Minister Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has given a commitment to provide successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of &euro;100,000 subject to the total grant aid from both Departments not exceeding &euro;200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These CCTV systems will have to be installed to a high-end technical specification and operated in compliance with a strict code of practice. Access to these CCTV systems will also have to be given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.</P>
        <P>The scheme is being managed, on behalf my Department, by Area Development Management Limited, ADM. Communities who are not ready to apply for full scheme funding may apply for pre-development supports to assist in the formulation of high-quality proposals which will have the necessary elements of local support and sustainability.</P>
        <P>Full details of the scheme, together with the relevant application forms and guidelines, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<?oasys _jy?><i>www.justice.ie</i> or the ADM website at<?oasys _jy?><i>www.adm.ie</i>. They are also available directly from ADM, Holbrook House, Holles St., Dublin 2.</P>

        <P>The person in question originally arrived in Ireland in February 2000 and sought asylum. He withdrew his asylum claim and sought to invoke European Union law on free movement to obtain residency in the State, following his marriage in December 2000 to an EU national. The applicant was requested to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, evidence of the EU national&rsquo;s employment in Ireland. As his EU spouse was dependent on public funds and was not working in the State the application was refused.</P>
        <P>In July 2004 a further application for residency based on his marriage to an EU national was refused as his spouse&rsquo;s circumstances had not changed. The applicant and his solicitor were informed that as they had not provided any evidence that the EU national was working in the State, the non-EU spouse was not entitled to residency under the relevant EU provisions.</P>
        <P>My Department has no record of any subsequent application for residency on the basis of EU free movement rights.</P>

The code provides an integrated end to end solution for cash handling that will encourage the highest standards of operation while having due <Col N="1943" />regard to the circumstances of individual cash movements.</P>
        <P>Speaking at the signing ceremony, I indicated that the full costs of this new code are not known yet. However, there will be costs for all stakeholders. For security reasons, it would be inappropriate to provide too much detail on how this money will be spent but it should be pointed out that a considerable upgrading of systems will be required by the major cash in transit security companies and by the financial institutions to comply with the code.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is committed to providing resources for the setting up of a Garda technical advisory group which will provide the security competence and technical capacity to consistently and proactively assist stakeholders in identifying and designing solutions as required by the code. There will be no further resource implications for the State in implementing the code.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the code of practice starts immediately and stakeholders have agreed to be fully compliant with all aspects of the code within 18 months.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Carlow-Kildare division as at 28 June 2005 was 327, all ranks. This represents an increase of 35, or 12%, on the personnel allocated to the division since 31 December 1997. This compares with an increase of 1,277, or 11.6%, in the overall strength of the force in the period from 31 December 1997 to 1 June 2005.</P>
        <P>Newly attested groups of probationer garda&iacute; are allocated throughout the country four times each year. It should therefore be noted that the personnel strength of each division will fluctuate in between each allocation as a result of promotions, retirements and so on.</P>
        <P>Garda management states that the situation will be kept under review and when the next group of probationer garda&iacute; is being allocated the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division will be fully considered.</P>
        <P>Regarding Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division will be fully considered in the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised <Col N="1945" />that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

        <QRef>[23956/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>Statutes of limitation are not a feature of the criminal code of law, where the State, in the public interest, seeks to prosecute those who commit offences because the committing of such offences, which may result in injury to individuals, are an affront also to society at large, although the courts will prevent a prosecution from proceeding in particular cases where they are satisfied that because of the passage of time it would be unsafe to proceed.</P>
        <P>By contrast, the civil law provides a means whereby an individual aggrieved by the actions of another can seek redress, in the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, usually in the form of monetary compensation, for the wrong alleged. Given the wide application of the civil law and the need for certainty in how people may arrange their affairs, statutes of limitation are a feature of the civil law as it relates, in particular, to claims made by one private individual against another private individual or body for compensation for civil wrongs.</P>
        <P>The limitation period for civil actions arising out of personal injury is generally three years from the date of the injury or, if later, the date on which the victim became aware, or could have become aware, of the injury. Where the injured person was under a disability at the time of the injury or of the date of knowledge, the three-year period does not start to run until the person is no longer under a disability. In this context, the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is used in a technical way as meaning either a person of unsound mind or a minor. Thus, for an injury done to a person as a child, the latest point at which the person can commence civil proceedings would generally be age <Col N="1946" />21, that is, three years after reaching the age of majority.</P>
        <P>In 2000, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act was passed on foot of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan and supported by the Government. This Act made important changes to the Statute of Limitations 1957 as it relates to acts of sexual abuse done to a person while a child. As a result of that Act, a victim of child sex abuse is regarded as under a disability if, as a result of that abuse or any other act of the abuser, the person is suffering a psychological injury which substantially impairs his or her ability to make a reasoned decision in respect of bringing the civil action. Thus, the three-year period does not start to run in such cases until the victim has recovered sufficiently from the psychological injury to be able to decide whether to bring the action.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that this measure strikes an appropriate balance between the right of the victim of child sex abuse to seek redress from the perpetrator once he or she has overcome the trauma of that abuse sufficiently to be able to commence proceedings, on the one hand, and the rights of people generally to be protected against stale claims, on the other. The courts hearing such a claim are best placed to judge how the change made in the 2000 Act applies in the particular case and it is open to the parties to adduce evidence of whatever criminal proceedings may be relevant to the civil proceedings.</P>

        <P>I understand that an application for capital grant assistance under the EOCP was submitted by this group to my Department some time ago. This application has been forwarded to Area Development Management Limited, which is engaged by my Department to carry out detailed assessments of all EOCP grant applications on my behalf. Each application for funding undergoes a thorough assessment by ADM to ensure it meets the EOCP funding criteria.</P>
        <P>The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the present programme. Following discussions with the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of &euro;90 million was made available, over the period 2005-09, in the context of the 2005 budget.</P>
        <P>This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;499.3 million and the amount set aside for capital developments to &euro;205 million. The availability of the additional capital funding is enabling me to make capital grant assistance available to groups which can show that they address significant child care service gaps and where their project proposals represent good value for money when considered in respect of the current guidelines on building costs.</P>
        <P>In the light of this, the group in question was advised in December 2004 that while its project had not been prioritised for immediate funding at that stage, it would be reconsidered for possible support in the future.</P>
        <P>The ongoing assessment of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care facilities and places at the earliest opportunity.

It was also necessary, prior to the coming into effect of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, which amended the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, to require certain undertakings in all cases before a warrant could be presented to the High Court for endorsement. Under the amendments contained in the 2005 Act, this is no longer necessary unless the court requests the undertakings.</P>

It is open to any person to bring an alleged breach of the provisions of the Act to the notice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The study to which I believe the Deputy refers in his question, Supporting Families of Drug-Dependent Offenders, examined the level of support that was available to families of drug dependent offenders in four European countries. The purpose of the study was to find out what services were available and what services were valued or desired by offenders and their families. This study did not, I understand, examine the impact that such services may have on recidivism.</P>
        <P>The need to develop family supports and guidance for families of substance abusers was highlighted throughout the consultation process of the recently published mid-term review of the national drugs strategy. It was felt that the family needs to be recognised as a support and a resource, as well as having their support needs addressed.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the steering group overseeing the review recommended that the following action be included in the national drugs strategy in order to implement the recommendations in the 2004 national advisory committee on drugs report, Role of Family Support Services in Drug Prevention, namely: to increase the capacity of services to respond through an appropriate level of resources and training for staff in services; to strengthen inter-agency links and networks by building knowledge of local community issues and attitudes thus improving communications; <Col N="1951" />and to develop relevant monitoring and evaluation tools to measure effectiveness of services.</P>
        <P>In addition, the mid-term review of the national strategy states that the national drugs strategy team should: actively encourage the local drugs task forces and regional drugs task forces to prioritise the provision of family services in their areas; and support family support networks in their work in the area of information provision and assistance to local family support groups. The agencies responsible for this action are the Health Service Executive, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the national drug strategy team.</P>
        <P>One of the core values of the Irish Prison Service is to endeavour to help prisoners, where possible and appropriate, to maintain relationships with their families. The National and Economic and Social Forum, NESF, report on the reintegration of prisoners &mdash; No. 22 of 2002 &mdash; makes a number of recommendations in regard to the provision of support to the families of prisoners and the Irish Prison Service continues to work in partnership with the probation and welfare service and other statutory, voluntary and community agencies and services to provide the best possible service and support to prisoners&rsquo; families.</P>
        <P>New external visiting facilities have been provided in recent years at Castlerea, Mountjoy, Cloverhill, and the Midlands prisons, as well as at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. In addition, new internal visitor facilities have been provided at Castlerea, Cloverhill and the Midlands prisons. A new visitors&rsquo; reception centre was opened in mid-2004 at Limerick Prison and another was opened in early 2005 at Portlaoise Prison. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends jointly manage, on behalf of the Prison Service, the visitors&rsquo; centres including cr&egrave;che facilities, at Mountjoy, Cloverhill and the Midlands prisons. The Bedford Row project manages the external visitors&rsquo; centre at Limerick Prison. The new visiting facilities at Portlaoise Prison are managed by the Irish Prison Service.</P>
        <P>In addition to these developments, families are facilitated in participating in a range of programmes in areas such as addiction, specific offending behaviour programmes and pre-release programmes. The recommendation in the NESF report as regards a prisoner family support strategy will also inform the elaboration of positive sentence management.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the probation and welfare service, provides funding to 69 voluntary bodies which provide a range of services to offenders in local communities, for example, pre-industrial training and education, offender management programmes, residential accommodation, drug and alcohol abuse treatment &mdash; intervention &mdash; awareness programmes, work with offenders in custody and post release, as well as providing a vital ingredient of a focused daytime programme for those found guilty of criminal offences by the courts and placed on supervision to the probation and welfare service.</P>
        <Col N="1952" />
        <P>A number of these projects, which work with drug dependent offenders, see it as being essential that parents and partners are active participants in the recovery programmes.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The probation and welfare service operates under the aegis of my Department and has in the region of 430 staff and an annual budget of approximately &euro;45 million. The objective of the service is to reduce re-offending and protect the public. It provides assessments on offenders to the courts and is responsible for the proposal and implementation of community sanctions. It also provides a probation service to prisons. My Department, through the service, provides funding to and works in association with 69 voluntary bodies in the provision of relevant services. The budget provision for assistance to voluntary bodies and their projects for the current year is &euro;14.434 million.</P>
        <P>The projects, which are made up of community groups and voluntary bodies, provide a range of services to offenders in local communities. I refer, for example, to pre-industrial training and education, offender management programmes, residential accommodation, drug and alcohol abuse treatment &mdash; intervention &mdash; awareness programmes, work with offenders in custody and post-release, as well as providing a vital ingredient of a focused daytime programme for those found guilty of criminal offences by the courts and <Col N="1953" />placed on supervision to the probation and welfare service.</P>
        <P>The effect is to make available to persons, as part of their supervision, access to intervention and facilities that might not otherwise be open to them because of their criminal histories. Many offenders fail to access or retain places in mainstream programmes or have become alienated from them, so they need the initial preparation of a positive learning experience from which they can move on to more specialised, community-wide services. For many too, particularly those released from custody, managed accommodation is vital to begin claiming social assistance, apply for training, commence employment, etc. With regard to the implementation of the Children Act 2001, Department of Finance sanction was obtained for an additional 30 staff for the probation and welfare service. Sections 78 to 87 of the Children Act 2001, which provide for a court-directed family conference convened by the probation and welfare service, were placed on a statutory footing with effect from 26 July 2004.</P>
        <P>A pilot mentor project is due to commence shortly in the north Dublin area. The programme, located in the probation and welfare service office in Coolock, will serve as a model for the development of mentor &mdash; family support &mdash; orders provided for under sections 131 and 132 of the Act. Recruitment of staff for this new and innovative project has taken place with the employment of a co-ordinator and administrator. The programme will recruit volunteers who will act as mentors to young people who have been before the courts and are under the supervision of the probation and welfare service.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of dealing with juveniles who offend is to consider the offender for inclusion in the juvenile diversion programme. The programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing and the relevant sections of the Act were commenced in May 2002.</P>
        <P>The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na responsible for administering the programme at the local level. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the year 2003, the Garda national juvenile office received 19,915 referrals, relating to 17,043 individual offenders, under the programme.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that, as of 6 December 2004, there were 86 juvenile liaison officer garda&iacute; and eight JLO sergeants working in the various divisions throughout the country. In addition, the national juvenile office <Col N="1954" />has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concept of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. Essentially, these provisions provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile&rsquo;s family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion. To facilitate these innovative developments, most of the Garda juvenile liaison officers have now received training in mediation skills, with advanced training being provided to selected officers. Since the commencement of the relevant part of the Children Act in 2002, and up to the end of 2003, a total of 147 restorative justice events have been held. Early assessments indicate a high level of satisfaction from all those involved in the process.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are in existence a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects. These projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved &mdash; or further involved &mdash; in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of &euro;5.471 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year. These programmes are responsible, in part, for the significant reduction in recent years in the number of under-21 year olds being sent to prison.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, some Irish prisons, no less than prisons in many other jurisdictions in the developed world, suffer from overcrowding and poor living conditions. These are matters which were of concern to me and the prisons authority interim board prior to publication of either of the reports referred to in the question.</P>
        <P>My priority is to proceed as quickly as possible with the replacement of Mountjoy, Portlaoise, and Cork prisons with new modern prison facilities. These are major long-term projects which will take a number of years to bring to fruition. I have availed of a number of recent opportunities to apprise the House of the significant progress already being made in relation to them.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that education and employment programmes in Irish prisons are insufficient by international standards. The reality is that the participation rate of more than 50% in prison education in Ireland is regarded as being high by <Col N="1955" />international comparison and vocational training opportunities for prisoners, leading to accredited certification and marketable skills, is well on a par with what is available to prisoners in other jurisdictions. That is not, of course, to say that there is room for complacency. There is constant updating and review of prisoner programmes to take account of changing needs and opportunities. I might add that every effort is being made in the course of the current industrial relations situation in the prisons to minimise disruption to education and vocational programmes.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that, as in other countries, persons with mental illness are committed to prison. In many cases, appropriate psychiatric care can be provided for such persons by visiting psychiatrists, including those from the Central Mental Hospital. What has been of particular concern to me is that prisoners who require inpatient psychiatric care are in a position to access such care within a reasonable time. In this regard, I welcome the allocation of additional funding to the Central Mental Hospital and the indication that a new 15-bed unit for the treatment of male prisoners is due to open in the near future and that the recruitment of 33 additional staff is under way.</P>
        <P>The reference in the Amnesty International report to a complaints mechanism for prisoners refers to a recommendation of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, that &ldquo;complaints procedures should offer appropriate guarantees of independence and impartiality, and persons who may have been ill-treated should not be discouraged from pursuing a complaint&rdquo;. The position is that prisoners already have a number of options in making complaints to independent and impartial persons and bodies, that is, the prison visiting committee, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, the prison chaplain, the prison doctor, the Minister and the CPT. Prisoners also have access to the courts and may complain to the European Court of Human Rights. Where allegations of assault or ill-treatment are involved, prisoners are facilitated in making complaints to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There are no proposals to establish a further independent complaints mechanism for prisoners. For further information on this matter, the Deputy may wish to refer to page 19 of the response of the Government to the report of the CPT on its visit to Ireland from 20 to 28 May 2002, which is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

        <P>I note with interest the observations of the Committee for the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD, in respect of the issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group. As the Deputy is aware, the CERD defines &ldquo;racial discrimination&rdquo; as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to challenging discrimination against Travellers and has defined membership of the Traveller community as a separate ground on which it is unlawful to discriminate under equality legislation. This was not meant to provide a lesser level of protection to Travellers compared to that afforded to members of ethnic minorities. On the contrary, the separate identification of Travellers in equality legislation guarantees that they are explicitly protected.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts the right of Travellers to their cultural identity, regardless of whether it may be properly described as an ethnic group and is committed to applying all the protections afforded to ethnic minorities by the Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination equally to Travellers.</P>
        <P>However, the Government did not conclude that Travellers are ethnically different from the majority of Irish people. The point also needs to be made that the Government is not alone in making this assessment. The 1995 task force report on the Traveller community, which consisted of Departments, civil society and Traveller representatives did not recommend that Travellers should be identified as an ethnic minority.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that complaints made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of allegations of the kind referred to by the Deputy are thoroughly investigated by it in order to establish the facts of the complaint and to gather evidence in order to <Col N="1967" />determine if a prosecution is warranted for submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>Provisions for victims are made by a number of Government agencies as well as non-governmental organisations. The rights and entitlements of victims of crime in Ireland are set out in the victims charter, published by my Department in 1999, following extensive consultations with all relevant agencies including the courts, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service, the probation and welfare service and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>The charter makes specific provision for particularly vulnerable victims, such as victims of sexual offences and domestic violence, elderly victims, victims with disabilities and children. It also contains specific provisions in respect of keeping victims informed of the outcome of their complaints and the progress and outcome of any criminal proceedings.</P>
        <P>The Garda charter for victims of crime, which is included in the victims charter, sets out what a victim can expect from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Victims who are not satisfied with the investigation of their case or have inquiries, suggestions or feedback on any aspect of treatment of the victims of crime by any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may contact the victim liaison officer, Community Relations Section, Harcourt Square, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, telephone 01 6663802, or their local superintendent.</P>

The other vacancy is due to Mr. Justice Aindrias &Oacute; Caoimh taking up a <Col N="1970" />position in the European Court of Justice. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal has one vacancy due to Mr. Con Murphy being appointed as a judge.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Service is currently running a competition for the appointment of chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 577, 579 and 582 together.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is heavily over-subscribed as a result of a significant number of pupils enrolling from outside its catchment area. The development of this type of situation can impact negatively on pupils from within the catchment area and who are entitled, as of right, to a place in a particular school. It also invariably impacts negatively on the school or schools to which these pupils should rightly attend and in which considerable capital investment has been made for this purpose. It is a matter for all school authorities, in the context of their enrolment policies, to limit enrolment to within their catchment areas to ensure that such situations do not arise. A school authority may offer places to pupils from outside the catchment area only if it does not have negative repercussions for additional accommodation and or transport costs.</P>
        <P>The school planning section of my Department is currently examining educational provision at primary and post-primary level in the Gorey area. Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. When this examination has been completed, my Department will bring forward plans as to how best the school accommodation needs of the area might be met into the future.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 583 and 584 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, special needs assistants, SNAs, are assigned to schools to meet the care needs of individual children who have been assessed by a psychologist as needing this type of support.</P>
        <P>Applications for SNA support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education which processes all applications for support from schools and communicates the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from <Col N="1975" />schools for SNAs that will be required from the beginning of September 2005.</P>
        <P>However, in order to ensure that resources are used in the most effective manner, a review has been conducted in recent months to establish whether primary schools have the level of SNA support that they need for children in their care, whether they have resources which they no longer need or whether they need extra resources.</P>
        <P>The review has found that some schools no longer have the care needs for which the SNA was originally sanctioned, that is, in some cases the child may have left the school while in other cases the care needs of the child have diminished as the child has progressed through the school. In this regard, the schools where surplus SNA support was identified have been advised that they may retain this surplus until the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that a review of SNA support has been completed at the school in question. The review has taken account of the level of SNA support currently in place for both pupils referred to by the Deputy. My officials will be communicating the outcome of the review to the school as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that this Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Indeed, since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from under 300 to over 6,000 nationally. In addition to this, more effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</P>

        <Quest>the progress which has been achieved for pupils, teachers and education infrastructure from June 2002 to June 2005; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The increased investment in education since 2002 has allowed major progress to be achieved for pupils and teachers and in the area of education infrastructure since 2002.</P>
        <P>While progress has been achieved across a wide range of areas, at first, second and third level, particular areas of priority have been the provision of services for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas, increasing access to third level education and modernising our school facilities.</P>
        <P>As regards education for children with special needs, the Deputy will be aware that since 2002, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act has been passed, the National Council for Special Education has been established, 71 local special needs organisers have been <Col N="1976" />recruited and there have been major increases in staffing. Indeed, more than 1,100 extra teachers have been hired in the past year to work directly with primary school children with special needs. There are, in fact, now more than 5,000 teachers and almost 6,000 special needs assistants in our primary schools, catering for the education and care requirements of children with special needs.</P>
        <P>A major emphasis has been placed on improving services for children and young people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Last month I launched an action plan for educational inclusion. The new plan will mean more support than ever before to help children, involve parents and support teachers in disadvantaged areas so that every child can reach his or her full potential.</P>
        <P>The new approach to tackling disadvantage will include better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools and a single integrated programme of supports for schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage, which will bring together and build upon some ten existing schemes and initiatives. Each school in the programme will benefit from a package of supports, with the highest level of assistance being targeted at young people in the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
        <P>Extra supports at primary level will include smaller classes, better supports for children during and outside of school time, targeted supports in the area of literacy and numeracy with a major focus on early intervention, and enhanced professional development for teachers.</P>
        <P>At second level, measures will include more guidance counsellors, improved library facilities and greater curricular choice. The action plan will be introduced on a phased basis &mdash; starting in the next school year &mdash; and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>On third level participation among students from disadvantaged areas, I would like to point out the major increase in the level of the top-up grant since it was introduced in 2002. The maximum level of maintenance payable in 2005, including top-up, will be &euro;5,355, compared to &euro;4,000 in 2002 and compared to a maximum grant payment of just &euro;2,032 in 1997. More than 11,000 students are benefiting from the top-up grant this year.</P>
        <P>Unprecedented resources have been provided in recent years for the school buildings and modernisation programme. Between the start of 2002 and the end of 2004 over 220 large-scale primary and post-primary building projects were completed throughout the country. During this period, my Department also sanctioned 4,927 grants for small scale building works including grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment in schools. A further 130 large scale building projects are due to be completed this year. Nearly &euro;500 million will be spent on school build<Col N="1977" />ing projects in 2005, which includes: 122 large-scale projects to proceed to tender and construction over a 12 to 15-month period; over 170 schools to benefit under devolved initiatives to provide permanent accommodation solutions to the needs of small primary schools and those schools in need of additional classroom accommodation; over 740 schools to benefit with refurbishment works on a devolved basis under the summer works scheme; and design work commencing on large scale projects at 43 schools and progressing at a further 124 schools. These are just some of the areas in which major progress has been made since 2002.</P>

        <P>The joint launch last September by my predecessor and the Minister with responsibility for education in Northern Ireland of the Middletown Centre for Autism marked the successful completion of the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown, County Armagh, on behalf of the Department of Education in the North and the Department of Education and Science in the South. Both Departments plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders.</P>
        <P>Four key services will be provided by the centre: a learning support service, on a residential basis; an educational assessment service, a training and advisory service; and an autism research and information service.</P>
        <P>Since the launch, my officials have had a number of meetings with their counterparts in Northern Ireland regarding the further development of the centre. A number of working groups are continuing to address the legal, financial, organisational and infrastructural aspects of the proposal. For example, work is continuing on the development of a campus masterplan for the Middletown property which, when complete, will guide the commissioning of any necessary infrastructure and refurbishment works. At this stage it is anticipated that the centre will be operational by autumn 2006.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 710 of 28 June 2005.</P>
        <P>I am happy to provide the Deputy with information on the recent progress made on this project. On 3 December 2004, Jarvis, which was appointed preferred bidder for the Cork School of Music project, announced that it had reached agreement with Hochtief Developments (UK) Ltd to purchase the PPP bidding arm of its business. Following the announcement, various issues surrounding the purchase were being completed and a revised proposal and documentation in connection with the project were received on 19 January 2005.</P>
        <P>As Hochtief had replaced Jarvis as the main member of the bidding consortium it had to satisfy the Department that had it applied under the terms of the original PPP advertised in 2000 it would have been one of the consortiums that pre-qualified for the project. In addition to satisfying the pre-qualification conditions and in advance of any formal contract negotiations, in recent months my Department&rsquo;s specialist advisers to the project had to undertake a full financial and legal due diligence to ensure that the new proposal met all EU procurement guidelines. Part of the due diligence process included contact with the relevant section of the EU Commission for clarification and advice on the procurement issue surrounding the change to the bidding consortiums.</P>
        <P>Formal detailed contract negotiations are now at an advanced stage and, subject to the satisfactory completion of these negotiations, I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the project in the near future.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which was established recently, and which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports.</P>
        <P>A total of 71 special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been recruited throughout the country and are a focal point of contact for schools and parents. My officials have been advised by the NCSE that no formal application for special educational needs supports has been received from the school authorities for the pupils referred to by the Deputy. However, the local SENO is familiar with the pupils in question and is of the opinion that both pupils fall within the high incidence disability categories and their <Col N="1979" />needs, therefore, can be catered for from within the school&rsquo;s general teaching allocation.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is 12.5 part-time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one to one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 590 and 592 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputies that my officials have worked closely with the Health Service Executive, HSE, northern area, to develop an appropriate placement for the person in question. This placement, at the Woodlawn centre in north Dublin, has met with the approval of the High Court and remains available to the person, should his parents be willing to consider sending him there. I believe that the care plan which has been offered by the State, is the best option for this young man, as it will meet the totality of his needs, by providing an integrated educational and health related support service to him on a residential basis.</P>
        <P>The Woodlawn centre provides assessment, care, rehabilitation and education for individuals who have both a learning disability and other difficulties such as behavioural problems. An individual education plan will be drawn up to meet the young man&rsquo;s needs and will be delivered by a specialist teacher with the support of the special needs assistant. I understand from the HSE that a person centred plan to provide for his care needs will also be drawn up and will be delivered by the appropriate support staff at Woodlawn. He will also have access to occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.</P>
        <P>My officials remain committed to working with the family to ensure a positive outcome. On the quality of autism services available generally, the Deputies are aware that every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs, including autism receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Current provision for pupils with autism include 146 special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools have been created; 14 pre-school classes for children with autism have been established; 10 autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism are being funded; and five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome have been created.</P>
        <P>All such classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 with the support of a minimum of 2 special needs assistants. The level of resource teaching support provided to pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. In general, such pupils would be eligible for five hours resource teaching support. In addition, my Department sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home-based applied behavioural analysis, ABA, programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such <Col N="1981" />children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs and in particular it is responsible for the following: deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those in the area referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require, when and where they require it. My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs, including those with autism, and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services. It is my intention that my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Health and Children in developing services for children with autism.</P>

        <P>The use of school facilities for educational purposes should always take precedence over other activities. My Department is spending nearly &euro;500 million on school building and modernisation works this year, but even with this unprecedented level of investment, requests for extra accommodation must be prioritised. It is simply not feasible for the Department to fund <Col N="1982" />the provision of additional classrooms in a school when there is already accommodation on site which could be used for this purpose.</P>
        <P>A new initiative was announced last week by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide funding for child care services in school facilities. I suggest that the creche provider contact the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see if any support is available for them. The board of management of the school in question is ultimately responsible for making decisions regarding the use of school facilities, but must naturally prioritise the school&rsquo;s needs for classroom space over the needs of other services that are only provided in a school while there is spare accommodation.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 593 and 594 together.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers opened with provisional recognition from my Department in September 2004. During the period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building.</P>
        <P>Officials in the planning section of the Department are currently examining the question of the best possible use for the premises on the site of the former Sunday school. This examination will have regard to both the level and type of current and anticipated demand for primary and post primary educational provision in the Newbridge area.</P>

        <P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support. The school referred to by the Deputy applied for curricular concessions for the 2005-06 school year but following consideration of the application was not granted any further allocation.</P>
        <P>An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation. The school in question appealed to this committee and has been granted 0.50 whole-time equivalent posts. Decisions of the appeals committee are final.</P>

        <P>The information provided by the Deputy essentially relates to the disadvantaged status of the school and the introduction of the general allocation system for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <Col N="1984" />
        <P>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of my Department&rsquo;s Giving Children an Even Break programme aimed at combating educational disadvantage. The school receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, which I launched recently provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The action plan will be introduced on a phased basis &mdash; starting in the next school year &mdash; and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>A key element of this action plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process, which is being conducted on behalf of the Department by the Educational Research Centre, is already underway. Questionnaires issued to all mainstream primary schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers and were due to be returned to the ERC by 31 May 2005. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group which includes representation from the INTO and the Irish primary principals&rsquo; network. Approximately 600 primary schools comprising 300 urban, 300 rural and 150 post primary schools will be included in the school support programme. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The introduction of this system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is 10 part-time hours. In addition, the school may be entitled to retain part-time hours under transitional arrangements to cater for the needs of individual pupils with high incidence special needs until such time as these pupils leave the school. I can also confirm that the school&rsquo;s resource teaching allocation under the new <Col N="1985" />scheme is based on its status as a small mixed school, that is, the first post is allocated at 105:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are those disadvantaged schools that are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme. The school is not eligible for such additional staffing and so does not qualify for the special 80:1 ratio for resource teacher allocation. The Department has received direct correspondence from the school in question on its general allocation and this is currently being examined by my officials.</P>

        <P>As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme 2005 for primary school building works a grant of &euro;440,000 was sanctioned to enable the management authorities of the school in question to provide additional permanent accommodation. The initiative allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives them control of the building project.</P>
        <P>My Department does not intend increasing the amount of the grant offered to the school. This is because a central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs, and ensuring value for money.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required psychological assessments before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it immediately.</P>
        <P>I confirm that, according to my Department&rsquo;s records, the pupil referred to by the Deputy falls within the high incidence disability categories. This information is based on a census completed by the school authorities in 2003 and his needs, therefore, can be catered for from within the school&rsquo;s general allocation.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is 17.5 part-time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure all their needs are met. I stress that there is nothing to stop the school from allocating one to one resource teaching to this pupil if it believes this is the best type of support to meet his needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which was established recently and has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports.</P>
        <P>A total of 71 special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been recruited throughout the country and are a focal point of contact for schools and parents. It is open to the school authorities to formally make an application for SEN supports for the pupil in question should he be assessed as having a lower incidence disability.</P>

        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is included in the rural dimension of my Department&rsquo;s Giving Children an Even Break programme aimed at combating educational disadvantage. The school receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs, was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year so that children who need their assistance can get it immediately.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangement, disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources, as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties. Furthermore, under the new model a new ratio has been introduced for small schools, with a lower appointment ratio for the first full post for each type of small school.</P>
        <Col N="1990" />
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is 17.5 part-time hours based on an enrolment of 71. The school&rsquo;s resource teaching allocation under the new scheme is based on its status as a small mixed school, that is, the first post is allocated at 105:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are those disadvantaged schools that are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break Scheme. The school in question is not eligible for such additional staffing and so does not qualify for the special 80:1 ratio for resource teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs who will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. In this regard, it should be noted that my Department has recently been informed by this school that six pupils who had individual allocations under the previous system have either left the school at this stage or will be leaving at the end of this school year.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s net allocation for <Col N="1992" />2004 was &euro;6,454,881,000. The provisional surplus for 2004 is &euro;145.2 million. Of this sum, &euro;50 million relates to unspent capital moneys which were carried forward into 2005 and have subsequently been spent. Of the &euro;95 million returned to the Department of Finance in 2004, &euro;45 million of this was made up of ESF receipts received late in the year. As the ESF receipts had not been received by late in the year, my Department prudently sought a supplementary Estimate to cover the possibility that these might not be received before year end to avoid an overspend in the Department&rsquo;s accounts for the year. When the ESF receipts came through before year end in 2004 they were then passed on to the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the point of the Supplementary Estimates process is to provide Oireachtas approval for whatever additional funding is required to avoid an excess, such as in circumstances in which expected ESF receipts might not arrive before year end. A further &euro;17 million of the &euro;95 million returned to the Department of Finance in 2004 is made up of other appropriations-in-aid. The latter are receipts which arise in the normal course of a Department&rsquo;s ordinary business and may be retained by it to meet expenditure. Aside from ESF receipts, appropriations-in-aid can include pension contributions and rentals and proceeds from certain sales.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas applies specific amounts of appropriations-in-aid to each Vote on an annual basis and these amounts are authorised in the annual Appropriations Act. If appropriations-in-aid in any one year exceed the amount provided for in an Estimate, the surplus cannot be used for additional expenditure and must be surrendered to the Exchequer unless the prior approval of the D&aacute;il has been obtained by means of a Supplementary Estimate. Failure to secure prior D&aacute;il approval will involve an excess Vote. It was not, therefore, available to my Department to spend these moneys. In effect, the real level of surrender for 2004 was, accordingly, about &euro;33 million or 0.5% of the net allocations. The net surrender takes account of underspends and overspends throughout the Vote.</P>
        <P>In looking at the real level of surrender for 2004, which I am sure the Deputy will accept is very low, it is important to remember some expenditure in my Department is necessarily demand led. The eventual cost of demand led expenditure items such as pensions or the student support schemes in a given year, for example, is obviously impossible to estimate with absolute accuracy at the start of the year. Taking all this into account, it is clear that my Department&rsquo;s actual expenditure was extremely close to that estimated for as a result of strong financial management procedures.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that at this point in time in the year the figures given above are pro<Col N="1993" />visional pending completion of the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. His report and completed appropriation accounts will contain the final details on all sub heads and is scheduled to be published this coming September.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 to 619, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy on the number of rural primary schools in County Roscommon and nationwide that have lost permanent resource teaching support is not readily available in my Department. Circular 01/05 refers to the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The NCSE became operational from 1 January 2005 and is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports in primary schools and special schools.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs, was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year so that children who need their assistance can get it immediately.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangement, disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources because research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
        <P>To ensure that every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an extra 660 resource teaching posts are being put in place for next September. Of these, 340 are permanent posts and 320 are temporary <Col N="1995" />posts being provided to ensure children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by my Department will keep these in circumstances in which the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow the school to provide these hours from within its general allocation.</P>
        <P>The provision of these temporary posts will ensure that no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by my Department will lose these under the new arrangements. The reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme. Addressing the concerns of small and rural schools was, as the Deputy will be aware, the reason I initiated a review of the original general allocation model which had been announced last year to come into effect in the 2005-06 school year. Following this review, a special improved ratio for small schools has been introduced to ensure they are given resource teaching hours on a more favourable basis.</P>
        <P>I confirm for the Deputy that where a pupil has a high incidence disability, that is, mild or borderline mild general learning disability, dyslexia or a learning support need, these needs will now be catered for from within the general allocation system recently announced to schools. Any pupils within these categories for whom applications were previously submitted to my Department now fall to be catered for from within this allocation. The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure all their needs are met.</P>
        <P>Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one to one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often, it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child. While the new scheme will not prevent schools from giving one to one time with the resource <Col N="1996" />teacher to children who need it, it is important to note that one to one teaching is not the best option for every child.</P>
        <P>It is also the case that pupils with lower incidence special needs, such as autism, will continue to be catered for on an individual application basis. As of next September there will be over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Government is deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special educational needs.</P>

        <P>The figures for the new entrants to the medical schools in Ireland for the 2003-04 academic year can be seen in the following table. As the Deputy will be aware, a working group on undergraduate medical education and training, representative of education and health interests, has been reviewing the organisation and delivery of medical training and education in Ireland. I anticipate that the full report of the working group will be available shortly and it is my intention to consider the broad range of recommendations that are expected, in consultation with my colleague, the Tan&aacute;iste and Minister for Health and Children. The question of increasing the numbers of places available in medical schools will be reviewed in this context.</P>

        <P>To date, my Department has spent &euro;44,310.68 on English-Irish translation services. Not all of this is attributable to the Official Languages Act as under section 10, the type of documents which must be published in the Irish and English language simultaneously include the following: any document setting out public policy proposals; annual reports; audited account or financial statements; and strategy statements.</P>
        <P>Aside from its statutory obligations under the 1998 Education Act, my Department is conscious of its Irish-speaking customer base. Traditionally, documents such as circulars, application forms and reports have always been available in both languages. For this reason, it is not possible to separate out from the &euro;44,310.68, the exact amount that is attributable to the Official Languages Act alone.</P>
        <P>For the remaining six months of the year, the estimate of costs includes both translation services and a language skills training programme for administrative staff and will be in the region of &euro;55,000.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 622 and 623 together.</P>
        <P>The total expenditure on school transport services in 2004 was &euro;109.845 million. The actual divide of expenditure between the primary and post-primary sectors, or by county, is not readily available. The most recent figures available indicate that about 30% of the budget is being expended on transport and grants for children with special needs who represent about 6% of the overall number of children carried.</P>

Officials in my Department recently requested an update on these discussions.</P>

        <P>The average age of the Bus &Eacute;ireann large capacity school bus is 16 years and the average age of all buses used for school transport is 11.5 years. It must be emphasised that an older bus does not mean an unsafe bus. No bus which is unsafe or dangerous is allowed onto the road to carry children. All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of Transport. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department&rsquo;s annual roadworthiness test.</P>
        <P>In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles are subject to a programme of scheduled servicing under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Contractors employed by Bus &Eacute;ireann are contractually obliged to keep their nominated vehicle in a safe and roadworthy condition at all times.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, Bus &Eacute;ireann has purchased a large number of vehicles as part of an ongoing school bus fleet replacement programme to continually improve the age profile and condition of their school bus fleet. In addition, the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet currently has some 400 large capacity buses that were transferred from the general service fleet into the dedicated school transport bus fleet. Over 250 of these buses were transferred in the period 1999-2003 and they represent another valuable source of replacement buses over this period. This investment has produced an improvement in the condition of the fleet generally and this fleet replacement programme, aimed at replacing older buses with more modern vehicles, is continuing.</P>

        <P>Legislation regarding the fitting and wearing of seat belts in public service vehicles including school buses is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. EU Directive 2003/20 requires seat belts to be used where they are fitted. This directive must be transposed into national law by 9 May 2006.</P>
        <P>Separately, proposals to extend the requirement for seat belts in all new vehicles, except for city buses used in stage stop routes, have been developed at EU level. When the directive is adopted, all new school buses being registered from a future date will require to be fitted with seat belts.</P>
        <P>The suitability of different restraint mechanisms is under active consideration by the Department of Education and Science in consultation with the Department of Transport and Bus &Eacute;ireann. These considerations will be guided by expert advice.</P>

        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>The terms of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 state that the board is comprised of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members, of whom one is the chief executive officer of the NEWB. Five ordinary members are appointed by the Minister after consultation with national associations of parents, school management organisations, the educational welfare officers, the voluntary sector and trade unions and staff associations representing teachers. The remaining six ordinary members are also appointed by the Minister following consultation with the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Arts, Sport and Tourism, and from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest and expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. There are currently no vacancies on the National Educational Welfare Board.</P>

        <P>: Due to the varied costs associated with undergraduate courses in the university sector, the Department does not have an overall unit cost per student. However, the estimated average recurrent cost to the State for the more common undergraduate courses of arts, business, science and engineering is &euro;7,000 per student per year. As there are higher costs associated with some courses, the unit costs to the State would be higher, for example the estimated unit cost per student to the State in respect of medicine in the university sector is &euro;8,500 per annum.</P>
        <P>A unit cost system of allocating funds to the institutes of technology has not yet been developed. The annual budget for each institute of technology is allocated on the basis of its total pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of its annual programmes and budget submission which is required under the RTC-DIT Acts. The allocation takes into account the complexity of the institute, the range of courses and facilities offered to students, the total number of students &mdash; both full-time and part-time &mdash; and the nature of the infrastructure. Decisions on the allocations also have regard to Government policy and priorities.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>A new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it immediately.</P>
        <P>Clustering facilitates the assignment of experienced teachers as well as allowing for better training of resource teachers on the basis that permanent posts will retain teachers for longer periods. This ultimately benefits the pupils.</P>
        <P>The considerations taken into account in drawing up the clusters for the purposes of the new general allocation model were a combination of the levels of allocations of teachers, geographic location and existing levels of special needs teaching supports in schools generally.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s inspectorate had a significant role in the initial organisation of new clusters as part of the general allocation system. Further clusters are now being proposed by schools where they wish to combine general allocation hours and/or low incidence hours for the purposes of establishing new or retaining existing resource teaching posts. Such proposals are being considered and responded to by my officials.</P>
        <Col N="2006" />
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, which became operational on 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports in primary schools and special schools.</P>
        <P>In consideration of these developments, there is no longer an ongoing role for the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate in the allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs in general.</P>

        <P>Ireland currently contributes a contingent of Defence Forces personnel to both EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to KFOR, the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo. In addition, a small number of Defence Forces personnel are deployed at both EUFOR and KFOR headquarters in various staff and liaison appointments. Both missions were established under the authority of the UN Security Council.</P>
        <P>The chain of command for both missions operates along normal military lines and as such both Irish contingents come under the operational control of the force commander for each mission, who has the authority to designate the chain of command for the force. Irish personnel serving with both missions are subject to the provisions of the Defence Acts 1954 to 1988 similar to personnel operating at home in Ireland. Similar command arrangements apply in relation to UN-led peace support operations.</P>

        <P>Under the Defence Forces pensions schemes and the Army Pensions Acts, pensions or allowances may be granted in certain circumstances to or in respect of the children of deceased members of the Permanent Defence Force. Payment usually ceases when the child reaches a specified upper age limit. However, payment continues beyond the age limit in the case of a child who is incapable of self-support due to a permanent mental or physical disablement. Entitlement to such payments is usually established on foot of information provided at my Department&rsquo;s request by the next of kin or personal representative of the deceased member of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>The specific information regarding the number of children in receipt of payments beyond the age limit is not readily available but the number would be relatively small.</P>

On 15 July 1998, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks, including Clancy, considered surplus to military requirements. The military presence in Clancy Barracks ended in 2001. The barracks was sold to Florence Properties Limited for &euro;25.4 million in 2004.</P>

        <P>A contingent of the Permanent Defence Force has been serving with the United Nations mission in Liberia, UNMIL, since December 2003. Initial deployment was for one year, an extension of which was approved by Government for another year in December 2004, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. Later this year, I will be bringing proposals to the Government for the continued deployment of a contingent with the mission beyond December 2005.</P>
        <P>My predecessor signalled the Government&rsquo;s intention that Defence Forces involvement in UNMIL would not exceed two to three years in duration and the United Nations has been advised accordingly. Elections, which are planned for October 2005, under the comprehensive peace agreement of August 2003, should be completed by the time the Irish contingent withdraws. We are there to assist the people of Liberia to regain the peace they deserve. It is now general policy that deployments of Defence Forces contingents to peace support missions overseas should be for defined periods.</P>

        <P>Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade as to the use of Casement Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, however, military aerodromes are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit.</P>
        <Col N="2011" />
        <P>Before any consideration can be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. This is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Minister for Transport.</P>

        <P>The manager of Weston Airport wrote to my Department in July 2004 concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, the likely impact of the proposed development of the Weston Aerodrome on military airspace and seeking authorisations in this regard. It was considered inappropriate for my Department to enter into formal discussions with Weston until such a time as Weston Airport secures the necessary planning permission for the proposed development and this was notified to the Irish Aviation Authority in writing by my Department and copied to the manager of Weston Airport.</P>
        <P>I am advised the Air Corps has had informal communications with Weston management within the past 12 months. However, all such communication has ceased pending receipt by Weston of the relevant planning permission and approvals.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 658 and 659 together.</P>
        <P>The inaugural Civil Defence Board was appointed with effect from 5 June 2002 for three years. Accordingly, a new board is required to be appointed and nominations are being considered. Appointments to the Civil Defence Board are made on the basis of four persons who, in the <Col N="2012" />opinion of the Minister, have experience in business, industry, finance or administration; the director general, Civil Defence Board; a volunteer member of Civil Defence; a member of the staff of the board; an officer of the Defence Forces nominated by the Chief of Staff; a nominee of the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association; a nominee of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with experience in emergency planning; a nominee of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland; a nominee of the Environmental Protection Agency; a member of the Civil Defence Officers&rsquo; Association; a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na nominated by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Central Council of the Irish Red Cross Society consists of members elected by the various society areas and of members nominated by Government. The Government appointees&rsquo; term of office expires on 30 April 2006. There is one vacancy on the Central Council of the Red Cross due to the death of a member in October 2003. However, the number of Government nominees remaining complies with the legislative requirement.</P>
        <P>There is no vacancy on the board of Coiste an Asgard, but one vacancy is due to arise later this year. In general, persons appointed to the board of Coiste an Asgard have experience in sailing or other relevant experience.</P>
        <P>In appointing persons to the boards under my aegis, I follow the guidelines set out in the Cabinet handbook regarding eligibility, transparency and gender balance. The Department of Finance, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, has been considering whether tax clearance certificates can and should be required of persons being considered for appointment to State boards. Based on the outcome of that process, further consideration will be given as to whether any change to the existing arrangements is appropriate or not.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
        <P>Whales are not hunted in Irish waters, and are subject to protection in several ways. Under the Whale Fisheries Act 1937, the catching or treating of whales by any ship within the exclusive fishery limits of the State is prohibited. Section 11(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 makes it a function of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to secure the conservation of wildlife, including wild mammals such as whale species. In 1991 Ireland declared all our seas a whale and dolphin sanctuary, as a further indication of our commitment to conserve and protect these spec<Col N="2013" />ies. Ireland has adhered to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling since 1985 and is a member of the International Whaling Commission, which oversees this convention. Ireland was represented at the 57th Meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Ulsan, Republic of Korea last week. At this meeting, Ireland supported several decisions consistent with the Government&rsquo;s views on hunting for whales.</P>
        <P>These decisions included the rejection of a proposal to remove the ban on commercial whaling, which was imposed by the Commission from 1985-86; the rejection of a proposal for a new scientific research programme by Japan in the Antarctic, which intended to double the take of minke whales to over 5,000, and also to take 220 fin and 200 humpback whales, over the next six years; support for the creation of a South Atlantic Sanctuary for whales; and the rejection of a proposal to abolish the Southern Ocean Sanctuary, which was established by the International Whaling Commission in 1994.</P>

A provision of &euro;15.6 million was allocated to the health boards for the operation of the scheme in 2004 and was claimed and paid to the boards in respect of expenditure incurred by them under the scheme in that year.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
        <P>The compilation of a register of electors is a matter for the appropriate registration authority in accordance with electoral law. In order to be able to vote at elections and referenda in this jurisdiction, a person&rsquo;s name must be entered in the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides. Subject to this primary requirement, the person&rsquo;s citizenship then determines the polls at which he or she is entitled to vote. Irish citizens who are registered to vote may vote at all polls. British citizens may vote at D&aacute;il, European and local elections, EU citizens &mdash; other than Irish and British citizens &mdash; may vote at European and local elections and non-EU citizens may vote at local elections only.</P>
        <P>Postal voting is provided for in respect of certain categories of person as specified in electoral law. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting for members of the Garda, whole-time members of the Defence Forces and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories, including electors living at home who are unable <Col N="2017" />to vote because of a physical illness or disability, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996; electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day, the Electoral Act 1997; full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State, the Electoral Act 1997; and certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
        <P>The question of voting rights for Irish citizens living abroad has been considered in detail on a number of occasions, most recently by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its examination of Parliament. In respect of emigrant participation in political life, the seventh progress report of the committee, published in March 2002, concluded that the right to vote in D&aacute;il elections should remain confined to citizens ordinarily resident in the State and that the right to vote at referenda should not be granted to emigrants. While electoral law is subject to ongoing review and suggestions are made on specific issues from time to time, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements.</P>

        <P>Works carried out at the Rock of Dunamase prior to the national development plan, NDP, consisted mainly of archaeological excavations. The nature of these excavations unavoidably resulted in the site being left in a more fragile condition. This first phase of works established the methodology to be adopted in subsequent phases and involved comprehensive topographical, photographic and architectural surveys of the site, removal of vegetation and provision of access routes without damage to existing ground surface. Consolidation and repair of masonry faces uncovered in the <Col N="2018" />archaeological excavation and other extant masonry was carried out by skilled craftspeople using suitable lime mortars and stone.</P>
        <P>The main objective of phase 2 of the NDP project is to stabilise, consolidate and conserve the structures on the site in accordance with the methodologies established in phase 1 including further conservation and repairs to stone walls, provision of graded access routes and site fencing. The conservation works to the walls will be quite extensive, aimed at consolidating existing structures to safeguard the monument in the future. The project will leave the structures looking substantially as they were, but stabilised to prevent further deterioration, with the site being made safe for public access and the provision of interpretative materials. The contract was awarded in January 2005 at a value of &euro;1,139,313. Works commenced immediately and are expected to take two years to complete.</P>

        <P>Under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, accommodation may be provided for persons with special needs such as the elderly, homeless or persons with disabilities.

Considerable progress has been made in the designation of special areas of conservation, SAC, <Col N="2021" />since the judgment of the court in 2001. Ireland has met all of its SAC designation obligations, subject to finalising the limited extension of some salmon river SACs, the designation of certain sites where landowner appeals are still outstanding and, in common with all other member states, completing marine SAC proposals.</P>
        <P>Case C392-96 concerns the environment impact assessment directive. The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 are being amended so that the planning exemption for peat extraction will not apply and an application for planning permission will be needed where proposed peat extraction is likely to have significant effects on the environment, by reference to the criteria in Annex III of the environmental impact assessment directive, 85/337/EEC, as amended by 97/11/EC. The draft amending regulations concerned were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 June 2005 and are being debated in both Houses this week. I intend to sign these regulations after positive approval has been given by both Houses. Furthermore, the designation of peatland sites as natural heritage areas should be substantially completed by the end of July 2005, other than a relatively small number of sites where proposed designation is under appeal. Such designated sites will, of course, be subject to separate conservation controls.</P>
        <P>Case C396-00 refers to a judgment against Italy. I assume that the question intends to refer to the Irish case 396-01 relating to the nitrates directive. Following extensive consultations with the main farming organisations and other interested parties, a nitrates action programme was submitted to the EU Commission on 22 October 2004, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. In response, the EU Commission issued a letter of formal notice under Article 228 of the treaty indicating that the Commission did not regard the action programme as being complete or compliant with the judgment of the court. Following a series of discussions with the EU Commission and consideration of the issues involved by the Government a substantive response to the Article 228 letter was sent to the Commission on 20 April 2005 indicating that appropriate amendments would be made to the action programme. Work is continuing in my Department in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Commission in respect of the final details of the action programme and I expect to be in a position to submit a final text of the programme to the EU Commission in July.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for case C67-02, relating to the shellfish waters directive. The Department of Health and Children has responsibility for case C354-99, relating to the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.</P>

        <P>I am advised that problems caused by mass balloon releases were first highlighted at a conference in Canada in 1989 on plastic and other debris found at sea. Balloons, some still partially inflated, had been found accumulating on islands off the east coast of Canada. In response to these findings some countries curtailed balloon releases. I am further advised of reports showing that an estimated 90% to 95% of released balloons rise to an altitude of five miles where the temperature and pressure is such that they burst into small fragments, with no potential to harm marine wildlife. While there have been reports of marine animals found with balloons in their stomachs, I understand that balloons form an extremely small percentage of potentially hazardous marine debris. It is not proposed at present to introduce legislation prohibiting the mass release of balloons.</P>

        <P>The Construction Industry Federation made a submission in April 2004 to the Department of the Taoiseach proposing a number of additional measures to accelerate delivery of affordable units under the affordable housing initiative, AHI. In response, the Taoiseach announced to the parties to Sustaining Progress in July 2004 that alternative strategies for fast-tracking delivery would be pursued, including the possibility of swapping valuable sites in return for affordable housing in a manner that ensures more units, quicker delivery and better value for money.</P>
        <P>Apart from the above, my Department is aware of only one other approach from the construction sector about the release of State lands under the AHI. This was made to my Department last year by an estate agent operating in the Cork area who inquired as to whether State lands, including the Department of Agriculture and Food site at Model Farm Road in Cork city, would be put on the market as a land swap option. The reply given orally by my Department was that all matters concerning the early delivery of units under the initiative were under active consideration.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The land swap programme is designed to accelerate delivery of affordable housing units under the affordable housing initiative. The model to be used will be similar to that piloted on the Harcourt Terrace Lane site. The exchange of a 0.4-acre site is now set to deliver some 193 affordable houses in private <Col N="2026" />housing estates, 140 of which will be available in 2005 with the balance in 2006. Consequently, substantially more households will benefit in a quicker timeframe than building on the Harcourt Terrace Lane site, which has a maximum residential development potential of some 30 apartments.</P>
        <P>As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will review their land management strategies to maximise the availability of land for their own housing programmes, voluntary and co-operative housing, housing partnerships with the private sector and to secure more active use of brownfield land and derelict sites.</P>

However, earlier this year in the context of the move to pay-by-use waste charging systems, the Department compiled data on the waste collection services being locally provided. I am arranging to forward this information to the Deputy. Regarding the types of recyclable materials collected, under the collection permit regulations it is a matter for the relevant permitting authority when issuing collection permits to specify the classes of waste to be segregated, collected and treated.

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 694 and 695 together.</P>
        <P>The compilation of detailed statistics on waste generation, recovery, recycling and final disposal are matters for the Environmental Protection Agency, which prepares the national waste database, NWD, every three years. The most recent such report was published in 2003, in respect of waste arising in 2001, and is available from the EPA. In addition, the EPA has published an interim national waste database report for the years 2003 and 2002.</P>
        <P>The export of waste is regulated by local authorities, in accordance with the EU Transfrontier Shipment of Waste, TFS, Regulation, Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Union, OJ L30, 6.2.1993. The following table sets out the tonnage of both hazardous and non-hazardous notified waste, which was exported in the years 2001 to 2003.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Beginning in 2004, the capital envelope agreement between my Department and the Department of Finance sets out aggregate capital provisions for my Department&rsquo;s programmes over rolling five-year periods, with the most recent envelope covering the period 2005 to 2009 valued at some &euro;9 billion. As part of the agreement the Department is allowed to operate a carryover facility of up to 10% of the current year&rsquo;s voted capital allocation, which was &euro;162 million in the case of 2004. My Department availed of a carryover of &euro;75.601 million, which is being applied to our capital programmes in 2005 and at 4.65% of total net 2004 capital provision was well below the 10% carryover allowed.</P>
        <P>Taking account of capital carryover, the net surplus surrendered to the Exchequer was &euro;5.486 million, representing only 0.24% of the 2004 provision. It should be noted that this amount was the aggregate net amount arising from savings and excesses across the full range of my Department&rsquo;s current and capital expenditure as well as fluctuations in appropriations-in-aid and so it is not practicable to relate it to individual subheads.</P>

        <P>Specific costs incurred by my Department in the implementation of the Act to date amount to &euro;11,277 in respect of the publication of notices under section 13 of the Act. My Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2005 do not separately identify a cost for implementing the provisions of the Act. Any additional costs arising with translation of material, publication of documents, or advertising, etc. as set out in the Department&rsquo;s scheme will be met from within the overall administrative <Col N="2031" />budget of the Department or the budget for individual projects and programmes.</P>
        <P>Prior to the enactment of the legislation, my Department was already making available Irish versions of publications such as the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy and annual report, and providing replies to correspondence in the language in which it was received. Accordingly, the Act in these areas involves no extra costs for my Department.</P>

        <P>Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. Under the directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005. Practical implementation of the directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully and in 2001 met the target of 25% packaging waste recycling required by the directive.</P>
        <P>The latest indications are that Ireland is on course to meet the higher recovery and recycling targets specified for end 2005. The EPA has reported in its national waste database interim report for 2003, published in December 2004, that packaging waste recovery increased to 44% in that year, up from 35% in 2002. Given that these arrangements are achieving the desired result in meeting the recovery targets, the introduction of <Col N="2032" />deposit and refund schemes for beverage containers is not under consideration.</P>

Section 168 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 makes provision for the inclusion of information on the likely significant impact on the environment in a draft planning scheme for a SDZ. Article 11 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Environmental Assessment) Regulations 2004, now provides that proposals for SDZ initiated on or after 21 July 2004 are subject to mandatory strategic environmental assessment, SEA, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/42/EC, which provides for the SEA of certain plans and programmes.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
        <P>I assume that the question refers to the recently issued policy direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The most recent waste management policy statement, Taking Stock and Moving Forward, published in April 2004, recognised that a prohibition on inter-regional movement of waste could be unduly restrictive in terms of securing the development of waste infrastructure and the objectives of waste management plans. Most existing waste facilities are not subject to conditions that limit the geographic area from which they can take waste. The absence of such restrictions has traditionally allowed local authorities to manage capacity constraints by providing for inter-regional movement of waste. Accordingly, the policy statement provided for an examination of the issues arising in terms of the inter-relationship between regional boundaries and waste facilities.</P>
        <P>Concerns about the implications of such planning conditions were expressed to my Department by stakeholders from both the public and private sectors, and in particular by the Irish Waste Management Association. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency in its 2001 waste database report recommended that the inter-regional movement and treatment of waste &ldquo;should be provided for . . . in appropriate circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Following legal advice, I recently issued guidance under section 60 of the Waste Management Act to clarify that the application of the proximity principle in the context of waste management does not entail interpreting administrative waste boundaries in such a manner as to inhibit the development of infrastructure, which would support the attainment of national waste policy objectives. This guidance is intended to provide greater clarity in regard to the appropriate application of the proximity principle so as to facilitate the provision of environmentally sustainable and economically viable waste infrastructure in accordance with national policy. I am advised that this guidance has been well received by both the public and private stakeholders. As requested by the Deputy, I am arranging to have copies of the submissions made to my predecessor forwarded to him.</P>

Producers may comply with the requirements of the WEEE directive either individually or as members of collective schemes. It is likely that there will be two collective schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European recycling platform, ERP. An industry-based registration body is being established and will commence registering producers in July 2005 as required by the directive. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will have the lead responsibility for enforcing the WEEE regulations with local authorities being responsible for enforcement of aspects relating to retailer obligations under the WEEE directive. The agency will also have responsibility for enforcing the RoHS regulations.</P>

        <P>It is a statutory function of the Private Residential Tenancies Board to review the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and any related enactments, and make recommendations to the Minister for amendments, as appropriate. I will consider any such recommendations following an adequate period of experience of the operation of the legislation. However, as I indicated in my reply to Question No. 177 on 14 October 2004, I do not consider that a review of the statutorily based registration fee structure is warranted.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 708 and 709 together.</P>
        <P>The Heritage Council has one vacancy following the resignation of a council member on appointment to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. It is anticipated that this vacancy will be filled in the context of the appointment of the new Heritage Council following the expiry of the term of the present council on 9 July 2005.</P>
        <P>In appointing persons to the boards under my aegis I follow the guidelines set out in the Cabinet handbook regarding eligibility, transparency and gender balance. The Department of Finance, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, has been considering whether tax clearance certificates can and should be required of persons being considered for appointment to State boards. Based on the outcome of that process, further consideration will be given as to whether any change to the existing arrangements is appropriate.</P>

        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme involves the relocation of my Department&rsquo;s functions to four locations &mdash; Wexford, Waterford, New Ross and Kilkenny &mdash; in the south east. The Local Government Computer Services Board is the only body under the aegis of my Department to be relocated to Drogheda. A total of 61 applications had been received at the central applications facility, CAF, priority cut-off date on 7 September 2004 in respect of the 91 posts to be decentralised.</P>
        <P>The board has drawn up and submitted to the decentralisation implementation group an implementation plan, which sets out the broad issues to be addressed in implementing the decentralisation programme. The board will be co-operating with my Department, the Department of Finance and the decentralisation implementation group to ensure implementation of the programme within agreed timescales. In this regard the board is not included on the list of those organisations considered potential early movers. </P>
