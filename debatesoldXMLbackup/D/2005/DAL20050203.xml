    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il to discuss an important matter which requires urgent attention, namely, the failure of Cork City Council to collect rubbish that is not placed in bins or is untagged and is lying on streets leaving the current European capital of culture resembling an open tip. In view of this I hope the Ceann Comhairle will accede to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent importance, namely, the failure of the Government to make the promised January decision on the future structure and funding of Aer Lingus; the fact that the two deadlines for that decision have now passed and the need for the Government to make an urgent decision on this matter as the airline is rapidly losing value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate an issue of national importance, namely, the need to pro<Col N="2" />tect consumers from the growing onslaught of direct marketing by post, e-mail and telephone through the introduction of tighter new legislation, including appropriate penalties and fines for non-compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public concern, namely, that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children immediately honour the terms of the agreement reached in early 2003 with the management of St. John of God north-east services for the provision of 94 additional staff at St. Mary&rsquo;s, Drumcar, for the delivery of care, including respite care, for persons with disabilities in the north-east region.</P>

      <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 17, the Water Services Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 1, Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals to put to the House on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Taoiseach appears to be intent on having a new outer radial route around Dublin, when is a decision likely to be made in respect of whether we are to have a Dublin metro and when is that Bill likely to be produced?</P>
      <P>Second, is it intended that the Government will make time available today for statements in the House following the statement issued last night by the IRA which is an affront to Irish people, North and South? Great resentment is taken at the commencement of the statement, that the leadership of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann makes the following points. There is one &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann in this country and that is the Irish Army and the members of the Irish Army wear that logo with pride on their uniforms. Is it intended that time will be set aside today for statements in the House following this implied threat that the Good Friday Agreement will not be concluded unless the provisional republican movement gets its way in all circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question was dealt with on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Minister may reply to the second question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously these are matters that can be referred to the Taoiseach who speaks on behalf of the Government on them. It is not for me to make further comment except to say that from our point of view it is a matter for the two Governments to discharge their responsibilities in ensuring that the Agreement is implemented in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion of Deputy Kenny. It would be appropriate if time were made available to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland after what was a petulant, belligerent and somewhat threatening statement last night from the IRA that seeks to lay the blame at everyone else&rsquo;s door for the stalling of the peace process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It sees nothing wrong with the discharging of its own responsibilities under the Belfast Agreement.</P>
      <P>In every D&aacute;il session since spring 2003 the work permits Bill has been promised for that session. Every day and increasingly we hear stories of the most outrageous exploitation of non-national workers in this jurisdiction. That Bill has been promised for publication each session since January 2003. Will the Minister for Finance say when it will come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been assured it will be published this session.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a matter for the Whips to decide at any time how the business of the House is ordered.</P>

      <P>The Government&rsquo;s position is clear. We will discharge our responsibilities and it is up to others to discharge theirs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, the Taoiseach and Ministers constantly state that it is a matter for the Whips to order business, but it is not a matter for the Whips, it is a matter for the House. The Government orders the business of the House. Therefore, it is a matter for it to make time available or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really a matter for the Order of Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much a matter for the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party supports the requests for time to be made available to discuss last night&rsquo;s IRA statement, especially because of its belligerent tone and its implication that weapons can be used as some kind of bargaining chip.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the position of other Deputies. Will the Minister for Finance take the opportunity to correct errors made by himself and the Taoiseach reported in yesterday&rsquo;s Official Report? The Taoiseach made two factual errors in his reply to a question about the M50, stating that something cannot be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that the record be corrected in both instances. The Minister for Finance also seems to have made a factual error in terms <Col N="5" />of whether the European Commission had made a preliminary finding or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Dublin Airport Authority intends to change the terms and conditions of its workers, in contravention of guarantees in the State Airports Act 2004, by ending the receipt of discounted flights by workers, does the Government intend to introduce amendments to the State Airports Act 2004 to facilitate that requirement of the airport authority?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>To enable the Government to elucidate on the position at the ESB, is it possible to indicate when the ESB Bill will come before the House? Furthermore, can it be done so as a matter of urgency in order that the House might have an opportunity to discuss the issues which are likely to affect the ESB in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

When will the transport (increase in CIE borrowings) Bill come before the House? In the context of problems with the N72 and N73 in north Cork, when will the national roads infrastructure Bill come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate to raise issues on the Order of Business which are not promised in the House. We would be here all day if every Member of the House wished to raise <Col N="6" />an issue either at a national level or concerning his or her constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Title>Personal Explanation by Minister.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has given notice in writing that he wishes to make a personal explanation and I have decided to permit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen">
      <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday of this week from Deputy Burton, I indicated that no further communication had been received from the European Commission since last April in regard to the position of staggering tax relief under EU state aid rules. I wish to correct the D&aacute;il record in that respect that it has since been brought to my attention that the Commission issued a letter on 6 January for transmission to my Department via the permanent representation in Brussels. This is the normal route for such communications. This letter had not been received by my Department at the time I answered the question. Such a letter was not in the Department and consequently I could not have been aware of it when I replied. When subsequently informed that such a letter existed in my Department, I immediately sought and was given a copy of the letter by the Commission services.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the Commission Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development states that it has come to a preliminary conclusion that the stallion tax exemption would seem to constitute an aid scheme which is not compatible with the Common Market. The letter sets out the Commission&rsquo;s reasoning and, against this background, invites Ireland to submit its comments within one month together with any concrete proposals regarding how the scheme in question could be brought in line with Article 7 of the EC treaty. My Department is examining the letter and will arrange to meet the Commission. This matter will require taking legal advice. We have sought an extension of the one-month deadline which I believe will be granted.</P>
      <P>I regret that this information was not available to me at the time I answered the question. I <Col N="8" />apologise for inadvertently not providing the correct information to the House for the reason I have given and am glad to take this opportunity to correct the record with this updated information.</P>

    <Title>Water Services Bill 2003 <?oasys _cf1-?>[<?oasys _cf2-?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1-?>]<?oasys _cf3-?>: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a water services Bill but not that which is before the House because it restricts itself to the management of water. The broader issue of the provision of adequate water supplies to meet domestic and industrial needs is one I have raised in numerous parliamentary questions in recent years. Ireland has been lucky, or unlucky as the case may be, to have had heavy annual rainfalls for the last nine years. There has been no dearth of water supplies, making it necessary to draw on resources. However, three consecutive dry seasons could lead to a drought, meaning current storage facilities would be inadequate to meet requirements. In that respect, the Water Services Bill fails.</P>
      <P>Many Members have decried one-off rural housing because it may damage the water table and pollute water supplies. I have read and listened to individuals in the media proclaim themselves experts on the issue. However, an ironic event has occurred in the Kildare North constituency. Part of the Bog of Allen is a high water table area. A proposal has been approved by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and supported by Kildare County Council to provide a landfill on this water-saturated site. While there is logic in all that local authorities suggest, occasionally it can stretch the imagination. What is the wisdom behind locating a landfill site in the Bog of Allen with the potential to pollute a large area as far as the River Shannon and north Munster? People wishing to build houses in the same area are regularly refused planning permission on the grounds of pollution risks in this high water table area. The excuse often given is that an extra septic tank or water treatment system would contribute to the pollution of the area. It is hypocritical of the Department, the local authority and experts to suggest that a massive landfill with a lifespan of 15 years will be less of a pollution threat than four dozen houses. I do not accept that notion.</P>
      <P>We must legislate for people too. People have needs to live in the area in which they were born and raised. When the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has disposed of the unworkable electronic ballot boxes that he inherited from his predecessors, possibly by igniting them, he might then consider other options in the provision of <Col N="9" />water services. Will he identify a route that will provide what the Bill intends without it being undermined by a serious flaw in planning guidelines?</P>
      <P>It will be argued that everyone opposes proposals in their backyard, the NIMBY factor. I admit the proposed site is in my backyard. However, I oppose it because County Kildare has already catered for one landfill at Kill. I do not wish my constituency to become the location for every landfill requirement in the State. Every other constituency has its responsibilities. This proposal has the potential to pollute the water system. I have asked in parliamentary questions if the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government approves the concept of having a landfill in the middle of a water-saturated area. Twenty years ago the local authority proposed a scenic lake with an amenity centre, marina and wildlife sanctuary for the same site. However, that was superseded by planning. Wise men and women have taken over the process and proposed a landfill. This illustrates the contradictions that sometimes emerge with the intention of legislation. The objective behind legislation can sometimes become confused and dimmed by other activities.</P>
      <P>We hear reports on a regular basis of the poor quality of the domestic water supply. Water supply sources need to be carefully monitored and tested to the same rigours local authorities demand of applicants for rural housing in respect of water supply for their dwellings. If other water supplies were tested on the same basis as that of an applicant for rural housing, they would not pass. As the theory is the potential for pollution is less in an urban setting, such water tests are not required. Does that mean rural dwellers are less pollution conscious? The monitoring of the piped domestic supply needs to be tightened. I do not agree that to facilitate this objective, everyone should be swept out of the countryside to live in high-rise urban blocks. It is possible to achieve the same objective by ensuring water supplies are not polluted.</P>
      <P>Who are the main water polluters? The record will show that over the last 20 years local authorities have been among the culprits, particularly in the case of water treatment plants not functioning satisfactorily. In some cases, a year after they have been built, these plants fail to function. In other cases, the technology they use is out of date. There is no excuse for having a water treatment system <i>in situ</i> that is out of date in five years. Apropos of this, an expensive water treatment plant was built in Dublin city that within 18 months was failing to do its job.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The potential to pollute water supplies is not dealt with in this Bill. Instead it will put in place structures for the control and sale of the water supply system in the future. The next most powerful sheikh will not be an oil one but a water one. Every other service and facility has become extraordinarily expensive, such as housing. The State is supposed <Col N="10" />to be full of money with everyone having sufficient resources to meet their requirements. However, for the past ten years young people have been denied access to an affordable housing market. Great pious tearing of hair, beating of breasts and gnashing of teeth has occurred but nothing has been done to address the issue. If water supplies fall into the hands of various groups, they will become equally powerful and influential. Water will become a scarce commodity sold on the market at a high price. This will not be good for the economy or society. It naturally follows where the Government failed to do its job. The Government has failed to invest sufficiently in the provision of the water infrastructure. It has been obvious for the past ten or 15 years that when the Government fails to do its job, someone else is forced to take up the race where it left off. While the Minister is relatively new to his Department, he knows the environment fairly well. Given his appointment to the Department, I hope we will see positive changes, because most of the changes we have witnessed and suffered as a result of over a number of years were not beneficial nor helpful, they were the opposite. The Minister&rsquo;s previous knowledge and service on a local authority is also a positive aspect. Nowadays the rules of this House prevent people from having parallel membership of local authorities, the negative aspects of which are already apparent. It is clear now that local authorities are relieved that Oireachtas members are no longer there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a relevance, but I do not wish to pour cold water on it just yet. The issue relates to who will run the services in the future, because obviously it will not be the local authorities. A structure will be introduced, which is allowed for under the Bill. However, it could be the local authorities. Up to three or four years ago, local group water schemes were set up by local community groups with whom the Minister&rsquo;s Department dealt directly. A liaison officer and engineer, who was always very helpful, dealt directly with the local people whether they were public representatives or community leaders, and the job was carried out. The responsibility now lies with the local authorities. When one rings up the local authority, no one answers the phone, they are at a meeting, they are returning from a meeting, they have not yet reached the next meeting or they are away, which is a serious problem.</P>
      <Col N="11" />
      <P>These services will be replaced by something else. The Minister is heading for a situation where he could almost shut down the whole place. He could get someone to produce a report once or twice a year. These are ineffective and they are becoming less and less effective. I will say more about that another time. While I spoke in the House during the dual mandate debate, I intend to return to the subject at an opportune time in the future to address the issues that now arise as a result of the passing of that legislation. I am aware that officials in the Department will laugh at my comments. I know why the legislation was introduced in the first place, but I will say more about that later.</P>
      <P>I return to the lack of progress in addressing issues relevant to the water supply and quality of water. Some of my colleagues referred to the advisability of having colour codes for water, such as brown water, clean water and so on. It appears that in Holland water is recycled approximately seven times and in Belgium it is recycled six times and so on.</P>
      <P>There is merit in one simple thing, which should have been done a long time ago. In rural areas, in particular, some builders provide a major water container during the construction of each dwelling. This means that roof water is collected, stored and pumped for domestic purposes other than for drinking. The water quality is perfect and prior to this many people used rain water for drinking water. There is no problem with that because it contains just what is in the atmosphere. To move that agenda forward, it might be possible to consider either a tax incentive or some other incentive to encourage the provision of major water storage tanks adjacent to houses. There is nothing to prevent that from happening in an urban setting. It would mean that people would have two types of water supply, one which is gathered free from the air and the other which is the domestic water supply. It would have advantages in that it would help to eliminate flooding because instead of the water being discharged immediately into ditches, water courses and shores, it will have the effect of storing the water at a crucial time.</P>
      <P>The amount of water that could be stored to alleviate flooding following 24-hour rainfall is surprising. There is no reason this should not be satisfactory and beneficial because it is soft water. As it is not hard water, it is amenable to metals, pipes, utensils and so on, therefore, it has a huge number of advantages. It does not have an iron or lime content. It is effectively distilled water. Perhaps the Minister will examine the prospect of utilising in the future this freely available water supply.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the degree to which we get advice on how to manage water levels, deal with development in the countryside and manage the environment in an eco-friendly manner. It is becoming increasingly difficult because, as the population increases, so too will the number of <Col N="12" />demands on the environment, whether water or other services. It is interesting that there are still sceptic tanks in Brussels and several other European cities. Even though sceptic tanks have been advanced as a result of modern technology and so on, they still exist. Yet experts on housing tell us that we can no longer have sceptic tanks because they cause pollution. That is not necessarily the case if they are operated properly.</P>
      <P>I was amused to read the overview of the Bill. It reads that the Bill concerns itself only with the actual provision of water services, in other words, the administration of water services. Why does it not seek directly to take on board wider environmental issues surrounding water resources such as pollution control; water quality in its broadest sense; river basin management, etc?</P>

      <P>I am depending on the Minister, who has ample experience of local government, to ensure that this legislation is not just a doubtful accolade of the production system in the Department. Its aim should be to improve the delivery and supply of water services, but it does not address these major issues. It provides a framework for someone to pay for this commodity in the future. The Minister should check this out. It is the whole purpose of the exercise. I am disappointed because I see no great merit in the Bill. However, I will not go into a decline as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies McHugh and Breen. If they do not turn up, however, I will use their time.</P>
      <P>I am not the environment spokesman for my party, even though there are a number of environmental issues in my constituency. I read recently about environmental problems in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency. A study was carried out in Trinity College which indicated that great amounts of rubbish could eventually seep into the water system in Wicklow and on to its roads. The study suggested a refundable deposit on bottles and cans and I would like the Minister to consider that again.</P>
      <P>On a couple of occasions during the past two years I have been on holidays in the south of Spain or the south of France to get a little sunshine outside this dreary House. When sunning oneself there, one can get a litre of water for about 30 cent in any shop. On returning to <Col N="13" />Ireland and finding a litre of water costing closer to &euro;1, I thought this was because we had some form of water conservation tax to encourage people to use it sparingly. Unfortunately, that is not so. It is just another example of rip-off Ireland, where a bottle of still water in a pub costs more than &euro;2 even though we are discouraging drink driving and urging people not to overdo things. Nevertheless, soft drinks and water, in particular, cost a fortune.</P>
      <P>There are no measures to encourage water conservation here. The Bill is welcome in one context but my party will vote against it because although it is designed to modernise and manage water supply and distribution systems it does not emphasise any aspect of conservation or sustainability or &mdash; most importantly &mdash; water quality. The Bill would have to be amended before the Green Party could support it.</P>
      <P>Our position on water has been clear for many years. I will give an example from my constituency. A couple of years ago, Lucan was flooded by heavy rainfall. A number of housing estates were seriously flooded when the river burst its banks in the village. There were rumours at the time that the new estates did not have proper drainage systems in place. The bottom line was that a housing estate was built on a flood plain and despite warnings the Adamstown strategic development zone was given the go-ahead without an environmental impact statement. I hope the European Commission might yet make a decision on that. We do not know exactly what the impact will be of building homes on flood plains in the Adamstown strategic development zone.</P>
      <P>Throughout many urban areas, not merely in my constituency, flooding is on the increase. Some of it is due to increased rainfall and in that context I am disappointed that so far my colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan has not had a chance to raise the issue of climate change in a meaningful debate which might attract widespread media coverage. Rainfall will continue to increase because of climate change. The increase will not be alarming but unless we manage our urban areas properly we will have more and more localised flooding. There is an opportunity for this Bill to include measures to ensure that the impact of rainfall in built-up areas is minimised. Roofs, for example, could have storage areas to prevent rainwater from flooding streets. That water could then be used in washing machines, to wash dishes and in showers. This is the sort of forward thinking needed for the 21st century and which with regard to building regulations and in terms of amending this Bill could have far-reaching impact. It could not happen overnight. Water can be a dangerous resource in that it can cause flooding and a very scarce resource in the sense that we do not have a great deal of clean, drinkable water in the country. That aspect must be addressed.</P>
      <P>It is a pity Deputy Jim Higgins is not present because his election to the D&aacute;il in 1997 resulted <Col N="14" />from his fantastic by-election showing in 1996 on the water charges issue. I agree with him that a charge on water like a charge on refuse collection, is an unjust double tax. However, where my party disagrees with regard to that is that a measure must be introduced to ensure proper recycling or conservation of water, so we support for example tags on bins. In my constituency people are now getting free tags by means of waivers or they pay &euro;6 per tag, which encourages people to use their green bins. Those bins should be collected more frequently but at least they are being used.</P>
      <P>The Green Party supports measures which encourage conservation. In that context, water metering with the introduction of a water charge down the line could be quite welcome, not in the unfair and unjust tax manner to which Deputy Jim Higgins has alluded over the years but in a proper, sane, sustainable manner whereby eventually domestic homes are metered along with industries, but with people also given a generous free quota of water per household or per user. The details could be worked out. In that way people will know that water is a scarce resource but also a human right to be utilised to a certain extent. During a hot summer drought, however, people should not be allowed to use lawn sprinklers without charge. This is where proper water metering would come in. People who use water normally over the year would pay nothing but if they were to exceed their water quota they would pay dearly for this scarce resource.</P>
      <P>That is the sort of water management measure needed. It would work if it were seen as an equitable measure rather than as an unfair flat rate tax. If it is shown to have an impact on people&rsquo;s income, some other form of refundable tax credit could be introduced to redress any loss people might incur. If one has to pay for something, one will conserve it: that message must go out in terms of all forms of waste, though people must still be allowed a free quota of water.</P>
      <P>Part 3 of this Bill could have recognised measures dealing with the water supply rather than with the end demand for water. Currently one is talking of putting in place measures to ensure that enough water comes out at the end, but with regard to water coming in, as I alluded to with regard to Adamstown, one could have a collection depot on top of a roof; one could have legislation making low-flush toilets compulsory in any new homes; showers might have to have a linked rainwater option, possibly involving tax incentives rather than penalties; and one could have taps which control water flow. All these measures could have been included in the Bill but unfortunately were not.</P>
      <P>My colleague Deputy Cuffe said that water conservation measures which looked at leaks and wastage in Dublin reduced leaks from two fifths of the original figure down to less than a third. However, that means nearly one in every three litres of water is still being wasted in the Dublin <Col N="15" />water supply, which is scandalous. Because we are seen as a country with abundant rainfall, the issue of water as a resource is not taken seriously, yet looking at the huge housing developments in the greater Dublin area it will be very difficult to supply all the people living there in the coming years without doing something like diverting water from the Shannon or elsewhere. That is why we must put more energy and investment into reducing the leaks and overhauling the pipework system over time.</P>
      <P>I mentioned domestic usage and medium-term measures. In the shorter term there are opportunities to implement water metering earlier for commercial usage. That is being introduced to some extent but the Green Party believes every commercial entity should have to pay. In terms of encouraging conservation, if employers&rsquo; PRSI were correspondingly reduced, for example, that would be a revenue-neutral effort but would encourage job creation and discourage pollution. These are the sort of policies the Green Party has been discussing for years. During successive elections we have been accused of being &ldquo;loony Greens&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the birds&rdquo; but the ESRI, for example, has come round to our way of thinking in terms of measures which promote employment and penalise pollution.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take all this on board in progressing the Bill. It is not even called a sustainable Bill and should be so renamed and made a sustainable Bill by means of amendments.</P>
      <P>I fear that I will not be able to talk for that long. There are only one or two other things I would like to say on this Bill. Having an ethos of conservation and emphasising efficiency would be one way to make it workable and save the Government a great deal of money in the long term. Rather than facilitating end demand, if we could reduce water wastage and pollution at source, both domestically and industrially, we would have a more efficient, cheaper and healthier water system.</P>
      <P>The last area to which I refer is water quality, which is not included in the Bill. However, the health of the drinker &mdash; or consumer, if one will &mdash; is crucial. Water quality has declined over many years. Many people would say that tap water is safe to drink, even in Amsterdam or London, where it is recycled seven times. However, is the water as good as it might be? In rural areas, there are opportunities to provide tax incentives to people who can separate and deal with sewage on their own land. I am not talking about septic tanks but disposal on the ground itself through planting and so on. There are also ways of using rainwater in both rural and urban settings.</P>
      <P>How one treats water must be changed in policy terms. Rather than adding chemicals, we must minimise infection. I speak of the enforcement of the nitrates directive, for example. There are ways and means of providing income for farmers, including those my colleague, Councillor <Col N="16" />Mary White, has pointed out. The Carlow sugar beet factory could easily be transformed into a factory producing biofuel. There are ways of raising farm incomes that would outweigh any small negative impact caused by enforcing the nitrates directive. Another issue is rural septic tanks; legislation could be passed to eliminate them ultimately.</P>
      <P>Regarding urban water, separation techniques are important. We are talking about dual piping in new buildings, with pure water used in drinking and &ldquo;grey&rdquo; or &ldquo;brown&rdquo; water in the shower and washing machine. I called for the use of roof rain, and I do not believe the householder should have to invest in installing such systems after the event, except where there are existing houses. In that context, grants should be made available for the installation of dual piping systems. If under the Bill that was mandatory for new dwellings, it would be a great step forward.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Gormley, I reiterate the fluoridation issue. I have previously raised it in the House on his behalf when he was not available. There is an opportunity to remove fluoride from the water. There has been ongoing debate on whether it is necessary, and the jury is out, but the precautionary principle should be applied when it comes to how we treat our water system. I will not enter into the health debate, since experts on both sides engage in mud-slinging. From having observed it, I believe that the evidence is inconclusive. If that is so, it is not good enough, and we should remove fluoride from drinking water, since enough chemicals are already being added to it.</P>
      <P>Another emphasis may sound facetious in the context of this debate, but perhaps the Minister might talk to his colleagues and try to ensure that still and sparkling water in pubs is subsidised or that publicans are at least forced to make it affordable. That issue is something of a gripe on my part.</P>
      <P>We have no strategy on wetlands, which play a substantial role in the water cycle, particularly in rural areas, and they should also be included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Water Services Bill 2003, a large document that deals with many issues. I pay tribute to the many group water schemes that have done this country great service, particularly in rural parts. Without such schemes, many rural homes miles away from the main water schemes would not have had access to a basic water supply. Many years ago, those rural schemes were set up by pioneers who had no particular expertise in the area of water services provision but had a driving ambition to effect a vital improvement to the areas in which they lived, leaving the bucket and well scenario behind them. They did the country a great service; they were courageous and provided all their effort and labour voluntarily.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is unfortunate that some group water schemes are, for various reasons, not <Col N="17" />very well run, in many cases because the original trustees have become tired and, for health or other reasons, are no longer able to carry on. Responsibility for running such schemes is not being passed on. Trustees take on a lifelong commitment, and the issue warrants attention. I hope the Minister will establish a regime to resolve those questions.</P>
      <P>The pollution of sources for group water schemes is of concern to many in rural Ireland. Prevention of pollution should be a priority. The treatment of water to make it potable also gives rise to concern. I refer in particular to the use of fluoride in water treatment. Various researchers have expressed concern about the possible harm to people through the use of fluoride in water treatment. In particular, worries have been expressed that the use of aluminium and fluoride in water might be responsible for the increase in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and pre-senile dementia, while the British Medical Association states that very high levels of fluoride may lead to bone disorders and disorders of the kidney, liver, heart, central nervous system and reproductive organs. It is also alarming to recognise that the Irish Forum on Fluoridation says that levels of 8 mg. per day are safe. That is exactly the level that the British Medical Association says is unsafe. I suppose that it is a case of experts differing and, perhaps, people dying.</P>
      <P>Pollution of water sources is a problem with many causes. One of the main ones can be found in the many inadequate sewage treatment plants dotted throughout the towns and villages of Ireland. Those inadequate plants, combined with the many towns and villages that have no sewage treatment plants at all, are the cause of a great deal of water pollution. Every day one can find evidence of untreated sewage lying on the surface of the land, flowing down the main streets of towns or being discharged into water streams.</P>
      <P>Many people may have difficulty comprehending the situation that I have described, but it is reality. Another reality regarding inadequate or absent sewage treatment systems in towns or villages is that planning authorities are refusing permission to developments, many of which are very modest proposals, in some cases comprising just a few houses. Unfortunately, the locations that I describe are in my constituency of Galway East. Many parts of the county have been neglected for several years, and it is soul-destroying that, at a time when investment is available to some of those towns and villages, developments are not allowed to proceed because of those inadequate or absent sewerage schemes. I request that the Minister take a particular interest in that lack of infrastructure and sewage treatment facilities in towns and villages and make additional resources available so schemes in the planning pipeline can proceed to construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche">
      <TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I know this is a <Col N="18" />diplomatic form that most Ministers engage in at the end of Second Stage but I genuinely thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions because they were valuable.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the debate in its entirety, and it was a very good one. Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l rightly categorised the Bill as modernising, reforming and consolidating legislation. It is aimed at bringing the water services, which were put in place in the 19th century, into the 21st century. Some of the points made can be incorporated in the Bill in changes we will make on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not provide for the reintroduction of domestic water charges, although I note that the Green Party indicated its support for domestic service charges for water in certain cases. It is probably the only party in the House that would urge a reintroduction of domestic water charges. Deputy Crowe and others might note that there is no hidden agenda in the Bill for the introduction of water charges. I have said that several times and it is in on record. Comments by Members to the contrary are unfounded and inaccurate. I repeat the assurance I gave Deputy Stanton, who asked about the issue. Charging for domestic water is prohibited specifically under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997. Nothing in the Water Services Bill will change that Act.</P>
      <P>Oddly, Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party swallowed this allegation hook, line and sinker, although his party colleague indicated this morning that he had some support for the concept of domestic water charges. Both Deputies can rest assured &mdash; they can sort out the differences between them &mdash; that this Bill does not provide for that. Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s contribution was an odd one for a party that advises higher taxes to pay for services and that has made something of a virtue of talking about the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle and so on. As in so much else about Deputy Ryan, he always faces in two opposite directions. He espouses principles in theory but demurs from applying them in practice. Thankfully, all his colleagues are not the same.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins and others raised the issue of privatisation, and the usual suspects fell in behind him. Deputy Connolly and Deputy Crowe staggered into the same <i>cul-de-sac</i>. Oddly, Deputy Ring, who is normally a very sane man, took the same line. His colleague, Deputy Durkan, trespassed close to that borderline again but did not quite cross it. Deputy Boyle also tilted at the windmill. The Bill neither envisages nor does it provide for privatisation of the provision of water services at this or any future date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore touched on the same issue but made a very interesting point. He particularly expressed reservations about the use of what he calls the unqualified reference to &ldquo;other persons&rdquo; in sections 27, 28 and 34. He felt that might be a device through which privatisation could occur. That is not the intention. The issue is one of terminology, and it is not a path to privatisation. If <Col N="19" />Deputy Gilmore or his party believes that the term &ldquo;other persons&rdquo; is sinister or that it has a potentially negative effect, I would be delighted to talk to him and perhaps insert alternative wording, if he has something in mind, into the Bill between now and Committee Stage. If Deputies on any side of the House have concerns about these words I ask them to let me know and we will deal with them if it is at all possible.</P>
      <P>I agree with a number of the points made on the issue of a strategic water services plan. Deputies Gilmore, Morgan, Flynn, McCormack, &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and Eamon Ryan, among others, spoke either in the House or privately about the strong case for reviewing the provisions in section 36. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd in particular made that point. Deputy Durkan also made the point tangentially this morning, as he is wont to do. He was concerned, as were Deputies on all sides of the House, that this section makes it an executive function of the relevant county or city manager rather than making it a reserved function of the elected council members.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will know my strong view that county managers play a good role but they are not the people who should determine policy in most areas. Deputy Lynch in particular need have no fears about that. She made the point somewhat trenchantly about county managers and that I would surrender the pass in this regard. I have asked my officials, particularly in light of the positive contributions made by Members on all sides of the House in this regard, to review the question of making this a reserved function between now and Committee Stage. I would be delighted to work with Opposition spokespersons and my own backbenchers who have made the same point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton queried whether the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act would apply. I am not sure what gave rise to the question but I assure him the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. They will apply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan spoke in a roundabout way about public officials in local authorities not being available either to members of the public or elected representatives. He trod a well-trodden path about the dual mandate. It would not be appropriate to go into that now but I agree with the Deputy that there is a scourge of voicemail across all local authorities. If someone rings a local authority they have to push button 1 to get one section or button 2 to get another. They are advised to push buttons 3, 4, 5 or 6, if they want to go insane. They then get on to a helper, usually a mid-Atlantic voice, who tells them they will get back to them but they never do. There is something fundamentally wrong with that. I made the point to county managers recently at a number of meetings that I expect that the citizens of this State should have the right to deal directly face to face, or at least over the telephone, with public officials. I expect that elected representatives of the public, irrespective of party or status, will be <Col N="20" />treated with due regard and that the type of issue Deputy Durkan touched on will end.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies wanted to pay tribute to the marvellous work done by group water schemes in maintaining and stimulating the life force of communities. I agree with the points made. I can think of very few organisations more entitled to credit, in terms of the voluntary sector, than the group water schemes. They are extraordinary. Since I have become Minister it has been my great pleasure to meet the federation whose members are a most progressive group, and we should support them.</P>
      <P>Concerns were expressed about the Bill&rsquo;s licensing provisions. Those concerns are misplaced. A stronger regulatory regime is imperative if we are to meet the relevant standards, and we all want to meet the standards. It is also pertinent in view of the European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland but we should not seek to achieve good standards just because the European court said we must. We should seek to achieve the best standards because our people deserve the best standards.</P>
      <P>The idea of the licensing arrangement is not to provide any sort of sinister control. The proposed licensing system for group water schemes is designed and intended specifically to help the sector to develop its services and fulfil its legal obligations. Deputy McHugh touched on difficulties that voluntary organisations can run into with the passage of time when trustees, for example, become old.</P>
      <P>The licensing arrangement is to give us the kind of assurances that Deputies Sargent and &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l touched on, that is, that the people can be assured of the quality of drinking water. The Department consulted widely on the issue with the rural water sector in the course of drafting the section. We had discussions at public fora and with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. Both the federation and the national rural water monitoring committee expressed their general support for the introduction of this Bill. The concerns that have been expressed, therefore, are probably misplaced. Schemes that will require licensing will be those involving 50 or more persons. In general, there are huge benefits to come out of licensing and the major beneficiaries will be the consumers.</P>
      <P>Training of volunteers and local authority staff alike is provided for under the auspices of the water services national training group. The overall approach would be to assist individual schemes in a systematic and programmed way. I know they are more than capable of responding to the supports and challenges that arise in that regard. The licensing scheme is intended to facilitate the systematic and planned improvement of services. I would like to see the new arrangements applied with a light touch and be subject to full consultation. We should not introduce a bureaucratic structure for bureaucracy&rsquo;s sake.</P>
      <P>With regard to scheme takeover, a point touched on by Deputy McHugh, schemes can be <Col N="21" />taken over on a temporary basis where there is a risk to public health or the environment, or to assist in the resolution of temporary operational problems such as those referred to by Deputy McHugh. That would enable water service authorities to guide a scheme through a temporary difficulty while allowing it to continue in operation. The provision is a wise one.</P>
      <P>There is perhaps no area on which there have been more confused contributions than on the issue of metering.</P>
      <P>The first point Members should bear in mind is that metering is not a Trojan horse through which domestic water charges will be introduced. The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has identified universal metering as the most effective way to curtail wastage of treated water. A member of the Green Party stated earlier that metering could be a positive development. I hope that party continues to say so because it is the case. Some 5,000 households, mostly in the Cavan-Monaghan area, in group water schemes are already metered. Schemes representing an additional 30,000 houses are currently considering such an initiative.</P>
      <P>The results of introducing monitoring as a conservation measure have been striking. Savings of up to 40% in water consumption levels have been achieved following the installation of meters. In one area alone, the saving following the introduction of metering for monitoring purposes was 67%. That is incredible. In this instance, metering for monitoring purposes helped local schemes encourage conservation attitudes among their users and deal with the issues under discussion such as those involving leaks. Installation of metering in the area of leak detection has given rise to remarkable results. In one instance involving a private house, 5,000 gallons of water were being lost each day through a leaking service connection. This was not the fault of the householder because the pipe was buried under concrete and nobody was aware that a leak existed until a meter was able to source its point of origin.</P>
      <P>The group scheme metering programme has also provided assistance in identifying unauthorised connections and supplies. That is important because it is not fair that certain people should be free riders in group water schemes. The programme has led to improved cost-effectiveness in the schemes in general. I was told an interesting story about a group water scheme in a particular part of the country where people are noted for being canny with their cash. The suggested introduction of metering to this scheme led to such a decline in waste water that the scheme saved 40% of its electricity. I am sure Members can guess the part of the country to which I am referring.</P>
      <P>I accept that many Deputies who represent urban areas would have some questions about metering. However, nobody who claims to be concerned about environmental protection and sustainable development can honestly seek to oppose its introduction because the savings involved are huge. For example, the current pilot <Col N="22" />metering project in Sligo has come up with some interesting data. This project is blazing a trail in terms of metering all non-domestic supplies. Most businesses accept that the metering of such supplies is fair and equitable. The project unearthed one case where almost 16 gallons were being lost per day through leakage in the service connection to a specific business premises. This represented an annual loss in terms of treated water costs of &euro;13,000. Such a profligate waste of resources cannot be tolerated. The other businesses in the area paying for water were effectively carrying a cost as a result of the leak. Metering systems are introduced to help with conservation and management of water and for no other reason.</P>
      <P>Deputies Morgan, Coveney, English and others referred to wastage and leaks in the water system. This issue has been identified as a priority matter for attention in the national water strategy which was completed in 2000. A study found that unaccounted for water formed a high percentage of water produced in local authority areas. That percentage rose to approximately 47% nationally, which is not acceptable because water costs a great deal to produce, treat and pump through the system. In some instances the leakage rate has been as high as 80% because of very bad or old pipes.</P>
      <P>The underground distribution system is the largest source of leakage. In May 2003, the former Minister announced the allocation of &euro;276 million as the first round in the water conservation programme. This funding was specifically aimed at conservation measures. The conservation programme is designed to identify and substantially reduce the levels of unaccounted for water, that is, leaks. Under the new programme, work falls into two broad categories. The first is made up of schemes which have already been completed in the study phase and which have either commenced network rehabilitation or are ready to do so. The value of work in that phase is &euro;194 million and in my view the repayment of the investment will be significant. The second category is comprised of local authorities which are not engaged in the study and &euro;82 million has been provided for this category. This investment will pay dividends. I agree with Deputies on all sides who indicated this is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, where there has been a programme of remediation, the loss of water has been reduced from 42% to 29%, which is an extraordinary saving. The figures for Donegal are even more dramatic, with water loss dropping from 59% to 39%. In Meath water loss has been reduced from 47% to 34% and in Kilkenny it has decreased from 45% to 29%. Deputy Coveney made the point that every local authority should be required to give an indication as to the standards of underground pipes in their areas. This issue was raised in the national water study and it is envisaged that such a commentary will be included in the water services strategic plan for each service authority. The point raised by the Deputy is catered for in section 36 of the Bill. <Col N="23" />Section 49 also provides that local service authorities will have powers to elicit the necessary information for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten referred to the introduction of on-the-spot fines for gratuitous waste of water. There is no such proposal in the Bill but it is an interesting suggestion, particularly because some people believe that water is costless. If he or his party spokesperson have a specific proposition in mind, I would be delighted to take it on board and see what can be done.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to devices to save water. For example, an inordinate number of them referred to the use of dual flush toilets as a conservation measure. It is a sensible proposition. There are several other measures, such as fitting and material standards, the design of apparatuses in terms of the water conservation matrix, investment in upgrading infrastructure and consumer responsibility, which were also mentioned. I accept that these suggestions form pillars in a water conservation strategy. I will look favourably at the proposal relating to dual flush toilets when amending the part of the building regulations relating to hygiene. I intend to publish the relevant draft regulatory proposals for public-industry in consultation with the building regulations advisory body. If Members have views on this matter, I would be delighted to listen to them and take them on board in terms of seeing what might be done.</P>
      <P>A number of Members, including Deputy English, inquired as to whether rainwater could be used instead of treated potable water for commercial applications. Reduction of water demand by such means is a sensible proposition. Currently, agricultural demand stands at over 50% of the throughputs of the group water schemes. It is also estimated that some 35% of consumption in homes is accounted for by the use of toilets. Harvesting rainwater is a matter to which we should give consideration. A pilot scheme on harvesting rainwater is currently being funded by the Department. This scheme is being spearheaded by the Dublin Institute of Technology in association with the national rural water monitoring committee, Teagasc, Carlow County Council and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. The project is intended to determine the cost-benefit of substituting rainwater for treated water in certain domestic situations, particularly in respect of farmyard uses. I am sure the contributions made by Deputies will help to encourage that study.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall raised an interesting point when she referred to the powers available to local authorities to intervene where a shared service connection linking a number of premises to a sewer is blocked. We have all had experiences of this problem. The current position is less than satisfactory and the Bill provides for a more balanced approach. Under section 43 of the Bill, while the onus to carry out the necessary work remains with those responsible for the connection <Col N="24" />in the first instance, a water services authority is given the necessary powers of intervention to carry out these particular works where a problem arises. Deputy Gilmore will be aware that this is a particularly common feature in parts of his constituency and in mine where there have been slightly different problems with connections over the years. Bad practices cause problems where groups of houses are linked into one particular pipe. If a problem occurs down the pipeline everybody suffers and nobody takes action. Section 43 should be helpful in that regard.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies instanced the question of builders walking away from problems relating to water and sewage in housing estates and suggested that matters would be helped if the Bill provided local authorities with the powers to refuse connections to public supplies until satisfied that proper standards were being adhered to. It is a good point and I will bear it in mind. I am not sure what I can do, but I am reiterating it so Deputies know I am taking it on board.</P>
      <P>Sections 55 and 61 respectively prohibit connection to a water supply or waste water supply without the agreement of the service provider. This also enables water service authorities to require that pipes be open for inspection and give directions as regards the completion and related infrastructure. This addresses, in part, the issue of rogue builders and rogue developers. The best people to address the issue of rogue builders and rogue developers, however, are local authorities doing their job well and ensuring that an estate is not handed over and that the inspections are carried out. All too frequently in the past there have been difficulties in this regard.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities are also urged to use their powers under the Planning and Development Act 2000 in regard to this issue. Deputy Coveney touched on this, specifically. Section 34(4)(<i>g</i>) of the 2000 Act enables a planning authority to impose conditions under a planning permission, requiring the provision of a bond for the satisfactory completion of a proposed development. As all Members of the House know, unfortunately in the past there have been cases of ludicrously low bonds being put in place. Significant profits are currently being made in the building trade, particularly on the development side. It is not unreasonable that local authorities clear and cover themselves with appropriate bonds.</P>
      <P>Under section 180, where a development has not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, it is obliged to take it in charge where so requested by a majority of the residents. Section 180 also allows the planning authority to apply any security given as a condition for planning permission for the adequate completion or remediation of the development. Again, that has happened in some cases, but not in others. Substantial amendments were also made on the enforcement procedures under the 2000 Act in order to ensure their effectiveness. I reiterate all of these point because a number of Deputies who <Col N="25" />take their roles seriously in representing the public interest, have recorded their dissatisfaction in this regard. This causes me concern. Powers exist within the planning laws and I insist that local authorities use those powers to ensure the type of issue mentioned by Deputy Coveney and others is not repeated.</P>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd was gracious in his comments on the level of investment. Funding was mentioned by many Opposition spokespersons and by Deputies from my own side. Many of the commentators were less accurate than Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd in their observations. I was surprised at this because a significant investment in improvement is being made in the water area by the Government. Exchequer expenditure on water services infrastructure increased from &euro;155 million in 1996 to &euro;400 million in 2004. That is an increase of almost 160%. Some &euro;4.4 billion has been provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to deliver a first-class water service to people, which is something we all want. In the period 1994-96, when conditions were different, total funding was &euro;433 million. I make these points because I consider that some of comments made about inadequate investment are not just inaccurate, while I am sure they were not made out of malice. Neither were they made to score political points. I am putting the facts on record so that people may be informed.</P>
      <P>The latest roll forward, for example, of the water services investment programme, covering the years 2004-06, consists of 869 projects at various stages of development, with a total value of just under &euro;5 billion. I will stray from the text, so to speak, to make one point in this regard. In quite a number of local authority areas where services are being rolled out which are desperately needed, the delays are being initiated from within minorities in these communities, ie, people abusing the planning system. We have just had the extraordinary case in Arklow where a much-needed sewage scheme has finally cleared the planning process after 12 years. There is no other country in Europe or in the OECD where it takes 12 years to get through the courts and the planning system. I have completed the review necessary for moving forward the Strategic Infrastructure Bill 2004.</P>
      <P>The figures for investment show that record levels of resources are being provided because they were not made available in the past. None of us can take joy in the past but we can all celebrate the fact that significant resources are being invested. On capital expenditure mention was made of shortfalls under the Department&rsquo;s Vote last year. The figure of &euro;650 million quoted, was incorrect. At the time the issue was raised the actual underspend compared to the comparative spend was &euro;268 million. That was too much, in my view, but it is significantly less than &euro;650 million. I am unhappy with that, but there are reasons why projects do not go ahead. I mentioned, for example, the Arklow scheme. The money is there for it to move forward. One or <Col N="26" />two local residents decided to have recourse to the courts. People with deep pockets can delay schemes that are in the public interest and it is happening all too often. Traditionally, the bulk of construction work took place during longer days and in better weather conditions and perhaps that is one of the excuses for delays.</P>
      <P>I want to move on to the cost to commercial users. A number of Deputies spoke about the cost of water to commercial users, raising the issue of water service pricing policy and its implications for non-domestic users. This was related to the issue of metering. Deputy Crowe raised a question on the recovery of costs. The recovery of costs for the provision of non-domestic water services, he suggested, should be operated on principles of transparency and equality. I suggest to him that this principle may not be put forward while one is viscerally opposed to the concept of metering. That is to be somewhat inconsistent. Water service costs will be recovered from the vast majority of non-domestic customers on the basis of per-cubic metre consolidated charge, which includes margin or capital costs. Metering of all non-domestic consumers is progressing nationally. I believe it is the most equitable way to deal with this. It will certainly facilitate the application of a charging mechanism and is the most equitable way of passing charges to commercial users. It is also the best way to reduce profligate waste.</P>
      <P>One Deputy described the charging for water services to business as a stealth tax. I suggest the Deputy might just grow up. It is not a stealth tax. To ask people who charge their customers for the services they provide to pay for the services provided to them by the taxpayer is certainly not a stealth tax. In general, if there is not some form of charging to commercial users or if, for example, such charges were to be abolished, then the general taxpayer would have to pay the bill. We all know water is an expensive commodity and I do not believe any sane person would really suggest that. I will not embarrass the Deputy by naming him. He is normally a sensible enough person.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Bill applies to waters in the pipe. A question was asked by Deputy Durkan as to why it does not deal with estuarial waters and all the other matters. The answer is absolutely simple, because we want to focus on water in the pipe, on the abstraction and the management of the water bodies. If one tries to cover the issues such as the management of water in lakes, river basins and all the other matters touched on and which, no doubt, require attention, I do not believe we would get the legislation through. It is appropriate we should focus strategically and tactically on this particular issue and resolve it.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?>
      <P>Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l mentioned the perennial problem of water leakages or breakdowns in schemes. Every public representative is aware of this. It normally happens at the weekends, particularly on holiday weekends. The only person avail<Col N="27" />able to be contacted is the local Deputy. The service providers are nowhere to be seen. Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l put forward a good proposition on a 24-hour emergency number. I will ask county managers to do this. A local mobile phone number can be locally published as the emergency on-call number and be made available to every citizen. If there is an emergency in the water system, people can be contacted. As the taxpayer pays for much of the phone services in councils, county managers should take this on board. Through their network of councillors, I suggest that Deputies put proposals like this before councils.</P>
      <P>I remember an incident years ago where someone decided to dig with a JCB all day on Christmas Day. Whatever was on the television was not up to standard and his family was obviously driving him mad. He helpfully severed the water connection to several hundred thousand people in my constituency, and another councillor and I had the job of operating as water carriers for the day. It was simply not good enough.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>A number of Deputies dealt with the statutory right to water services for each household. In a modern society, I accept that every person should have access to water supplies. Deputies Gilmore and Twomey spoke about this. To oblige, by statute, water services authorities to provide water services in every and all conceivable situations would place an impossible burden on the system. While I fully accept the point made by Deputy Gilmore that everyone should have a right to expect a water supply, I am not sure that we should enshrine that right in statute. It could land us in grave difficulty if someone decides to build a house on the side of a mountain 15 miles from the nearest water connection. A blanket obligation to provide water services could force water service authorities into unreasonable circumstances. If someone decides to build a mansion on top of a mountain, replete with jacuzzi and all mod-cons, I am not sure that the taxpayer should pay for that. It is not what Deputy Gilmore had in mind when he made his proposition, but it would inevitably be the outcome of an obligation.</P>
      <P>It is apparent from the contributions that the term &ldquo;water services authority&rdquo;, as used in the Bill, is being misinterpreted and misunderstood. A number of Deputies spoke of water services authorities in doom laden terms. Deputy Ring saw the term as indicating a move away from local government. Nothing could be further from the truth. Deputy Ring might base his oratorical skills on reality because the water services authorities currently are the local authorities. To suggest that the terminology has some sinister use is over-egging the cake. I cannot think of a more accurate way of describing the various authorities and there is no possibility that the term &ldquo;water services authority&rdquo; can be regarded as anything other than benign. If people want to use words that do not frighten the horses, I will be willing to listen to them.</P>
      <Col N="28" />
      <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the nitrates directive. The Green Party is characteristically disingenuous in this area. Farmers were attacked, as is usual. The reality of the directive has moved on since the particular contribution was made. We have received a very disappointing response from the Commission and we are currently working to resolve the issue. I have had contacts with the farming organisations, which are very positive on the issue. The Brosnan report has been very helpful. Unfortunately, having made our submissions to Europe, certain complaints were made and the Commission has been back to us on the issue. There have been extensive discussions with the Commission and they will continue. I am disappointed by the initial response, but I regard it as a good proposition.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to requirements for the EU wastewater treatment directive. The directive requires the provision of secondary treatment for wastewater in urban areas, where certain population thresholds are reached. This has to be done by the end of 2005. It also requires appropriate treatment for sub-threshold populations. Very good progress was made during the course of the national development programme up to 2000. By the end of the 1990s, our compliance with the directive was approximately 25%. With the completion of the new wastewater treatment plant in Ringsend in 2003 and other plants in Wexford, Cork, Limerick and Galway, Ireland&rsquo;s compliance rate with the directive has now risen to 90%. The Department has been systematically working on a priority basis for the elimination of the practice of inadequately treating wastewater discharge. The Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme for 2004-06 also includes all schemes necessary to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government. The wastewater treatment of every amalgamation of population of over 1,000 will be in place or at an advanced stage by the end of 2005. The level of provision exceeds that required by the EU water directive. An issue that will arise will be whether people are willing to use the law of the land to stymie positive developments that are in the public good.</P>
      <P>Deputies Allen, Stanton and Connaughton referred in their contributions to the position on the drinking water directive. The European Commission initiated proceedings in the European Court of Justice in August 2000. The court found Ireland to be in breach of the directive. We are responding to the judgment by continuing to intensify numerous measures to strengthen delivery management and supervision of water services in Ireland. This Bill is part of that response. The most recent annual report from the EPA confirms a fundamentally good quality of drinking water in Ireland in 2003. The overall compliance rate of public water supplies with the prescribed standard now stands at 97.7%. When I compare the judgment against Ireland to the water quality in other member states, I am somewhat mystified as to why such a judgment could be given against us. The water quality here is sig<Col N="29" />nificantly better than that in other countries. Nonetheless, we have to aim to comply fully with the requirements. Planned investment of &euro;4.4 billion on the development of the upgrading of water supply infrastructure by the end of 2006 is intended to maximise compliance. We will depend on local authorities to help roll out this development.</P>
      <P>The issue of fluoride was mentioned by a number of Deputies. Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the fluoridation agent currently used in Ireland and is a product of a specific manufacturing process. It is not a by-product or a waste product, as Deputy Gormley suggested. The opponents of fluoridation frequently ignore the positive effect on the dental health of the nation. There is an issue of balance here. Deputy McHugh pointed to the fact that there is dramatically differing attitudes among experts on this issue. The amount of vigour, heat and energy put into the debate does not help our understanding of the issue. It is simply not good enough for Deputy Gormley to dismiss the work of the fluoride forum because he does not agree with the outcome. That is not dialogue or debate, it is simply adopting a Dr. Strangelove attitude. The rogue pilot in that film took a similar view to Deputy Gormley on the worldwide conspiracy of fluoridation. If he has not seen that classic film, I suggest the Deputy do so before he engages in any other flights of fantasy.</P>
      <P>The water framework was also mentioned. Clarification was requested on why section 30(3) of the Bill does not refer to Article 9 of the framework directive. Section 30(3) requires the Minister, in carrying out his or her functions under the Bill, to have regard to and take into account the full legal requirements that apply, including Article 9. I wish to clarify that the transposition of the terms of Article 9 into Irish law is included in the Bill. Deputy Gilmore specifically asked that question. Section 30(3) is included to address the requirements of Article 9. If the Deputy has a query on it, we can discuss it later.</P>
      <Col N="30" />
      <P>There is no hidden agenda. Article 9 reflects the established position relating to the continuing exemption of the domestic sector from charges for water services in Ireland. Our position in this regard is acknowledged. The Deputy&rsquo;s concern was that where Article 9 was not specifically referred to <i>ipso facto</i> there could be a problem with domestic charging. It does not arise and, in fact, the purpose of section 30(3) is to transpose the reference in Article 9. If the Deputy believes the section could be strengthened, I will be prepared to discuss it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is landmark legislation. It is another item in our regulatory reform agenda. It is the first time in more than a century that a single enactment will encapsulate the main provisions relating to the management and delivery of water services in one easy and accessible code. That is welcome. Consultation was part of the approach to the Bill and I intend to deal with Committee Stage in the same spirit. I have demonstrated that in my response on Second Stage. I will consider any reasonable proposition made.</P>
      <P>I sought to give Deputies assurances, particularly on the issue of where the function will lie and whether it is a reserved or an executive function. I will approach future debates in the same spirit because through partnership we can produce good legislation that will provide a good service for the people. It is not an issue that touches on individual party political interests but one on which all parties share a common resolve. I hope this Bill will be in effect for many years.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill and the consolidation it contains to the House. I am grateful to all the Members who spoke in this debate. I cannot remember a Bill that attracted more contributions. I am particularly grateful to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and Deputy Gilmore and I look forward to working with them to improve the Bill further on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern">
      <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill. The Government has continued the good work of previous administrations in introducing various programmes and measures to tackle disadvantage and exclusion in society. The dormant accounts scheme is one such measure. Every Member welcomed the original legislation to establish a framework for the use of unclaimed moneys in financial institutions to assist the less well-off. There has been consider<Col N="32" />able public debate on the Government&rsquo;s decision to make changes to the administration of dormant accounts and bring forward the legislation before us. The purpose of the Bill is to build on the progress made to date and address deficiencies which have become evident in the existing arrangements. The Government takes the view that there are compelling governance and public policy reasons to introduce legislation at this time.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware that the current value of the fund is in the order of &euro;200 million. While a prudent reserve must always be maintained in the fund to meet claims for repayment, it is anticipated that with further annual inflows the potential spend from the fund will increase considerably. While appropriate corporate governance structures are required to support and oversee the disbursement of funds on such a scale held in public trust, the existing legislation makes no provision for a proper organisational structure to support the board. Currently, the law provides for an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement for the secondment of staff from my Department. Given the emerging scale of the fund and the independence of the board, the Government is not satisfied that such an arrangement is tenable.</P>
      <P>The Government was also influenced in deciding to change the current arrangements by concerns about the accountability of the chairman of the board to the Committee of Public Accounts on disbursement decisions. The chairperson of the board, who is in a part-time post. is account<Col N="33" />able to the Committee of Public Accounts for decisions on the potential allocation of up to &euro;250 million. While having the highest regard for the ability and integrity of the chairman, this arrangement is not appropriate. The current arrangements are fundamentally deficient having regard to best practice in governance structures and organisational arrangements.</P>
      <P>Questions also arise from a public policy point of view. If we are serious about tackling severe disadvantage, the State must use all available resources for this purpose using a focused and sustained approach. In this regard, it must be ensured that spending from the fund is co-ordinated with policy priorities identified by Government and debated in this House. It is doubtful that current arrangements can secure optimal impact in this regard.</P>
      <P>Given the existing deficiencies, it could be argued that a new permanent administrative support structure should be established to enable the board to administer funding programmes. However, the Government has decided for a number of valid reasons not to take this route. First, such an arrangement would dissipate significant dormant accounts funds on administration costs; second, this option ignores the inherent finite nature of the fund; and third, critically, such an arrangement would bypass the expertise and knowledge within existing public bodies in tackling disadvantage and providing assistance to persons with a disability.</P>
      <P>A more logical approach is to draw on the expertise, knowledge and capabilities of existing public bodies. This is the approach favoured by the Government and provided for in this Bill. It limits bureaucracy and provides the framework for decision making consistent with public policy priorities approved by Government. It also minimises spending on administration and maximises funding for those who need it most. The Government has decided against setting up a new organisational structure for these reasons. Instead, the Bill provides that the Government will in future decide on disbursements from the fund following a public application process and within a framework of transparency and process set out in law.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, the key functions of independent planner and critical appraiser are being assigned to the board. This will ensure the board&rsquo;s independent input into the overall planning process. The Bill proposes that the board will retain responsibility for preparing the disbursement plan, which is the framework through which proposals for disbursements from the fund will be developed and the board will review and assess the extent to which the plan&rsquo;s objectives have been achieved and whether its strategies have been effective.</P>
      <P>Importantly, the board will also be conferred with a new power to report on the additionality of disbursements. In this way, critical analysis of the impact of such spending on the ground will be placed on a statutory independent footing through the board tracking and assessing dis<Col N="34" />bursement decisions. Having regard to these responsibilities, the board will have a key role in influencing the strategies for disbursements from the fund and in assessing the additionality and impact of spend. These arrangements demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a structured, transparent and effective board.</P>
      <P>While the purposes for which disbursements can be made will be to assist persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability, transparency in decision making on disbursements from the fund is important. Genuine concerns have been raised as to the extent to which the changes may adversely affect the focus and impact of spending from the fund. Recognising this, the Government has provided a range of measures in the Bill to secure and enhance transparency and accessibility. The existing objectives of disbursements from the fund and the key relevance of the disbursement plan will be retained. This ensures the focus of the spend.</P>
      <P>However, two further critical measures provided for in the Bill are a new requirement to publicise and invite applications for funding and to publicise the criteria for assessing such applications and a further requirement to publish lists of all successful application and the amounts involved. Each year, following Government approval of programmes and projects for funding, applications will be invited for eligible programmes or projects. Following evaluation of such applications by or on behalf of public bodies, the Government will approve a range of specific measures and projects. A statement containing details of the approvals will be laid before the Oireachtas and a list setting out the approved measures and projects and specifying the amounts to be disbursed will be published within one month.</P>
      <P>These rigorous and extensive measures confirm the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to ensure decisions on the fund are informed by the public interest, accessible to public application and fully subject to public scrutiny. The legislation also proposes that spending from dormant accounts will be channelled through the Votes of relevant Departments. It will be separately recorded and identifiable, thus facilitating the board in carrying out its new function to assess the additionality of spending from the fund. Where approval is given for a project, the relevant funding will be channelled through the Department principally dealing with that sectoral group. Dormant accounts spending will be tracked across Departments in this way and transparency relating to spend and additionality will be enhanced. This mechanism will afford opportunities to streamline funding to organisations that may receive assistance under a number of different headings from Departments and State agencies.</P>
      <P>Given the moneys involved and the opportunity presented to improve the lives of disadvantaged persons and communities, the <Col N="35" />Government, including the Minister, and I are committed to the highest standards of good practice in the operation of dormant accounts funds. It is our intention and the purpose of this Bill that disbursements from the fund will be made subject to the board&rsquo;s plan in a focused way using the existing mechanisms of the State.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government, I convey the Government&rsquo;s appreciation to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for the work it has undertaken to date. The willingness of board members to contribute their time and expertise to the service of the public should be acknowledged. All too often we take for granted and do not stop to acknowledge that members of State bodies are in many cases giving up their spare time, which is becoming scarcer with the demands of modem society. The board has been busy over the past few months progressing the initial round of funding. It has approved 420 projects to the value of approximately &euro;42 million, with a focus on supporting proposals within RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas. As the funding for these approved projects is disbursed, it will have a measurable impact on alleviating disadvantage in the worst affected areas. The Government will ensure that the good work initiated by the board will be continued.</P>
      <P>I refer to the main provisions of the legislation. Sections 1 to 5, inclusive, are standard provisions relating to definitions, establishment day, interpretation and so on. Section 6 amends the principal Act in regard to the section on penalties and proceedings, consequent on the removal of the provision in the principal Act on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information. Section 7 provides for a new Part 5 of the principal Act. With the exception of section 31, the other sections in Part 5 substantially reflect the existing provisions in the principal Act. Section 31 provides that the new dormant accounts board will prepare a disbursements plan and submit it to the Minister, and review, assess and report to the Minister on the pattern, impact and additionality of spending from the fund and the effectiveness of the strategies in the plan.</P>
      <P>Board membership, including the chairperson, is increased from nine to 11, with a corresponding increase in the quorum for meetings from five to six. The Minister will be responsible for appointing board members, all of whom must have knowledge or experience of matters relevant to the board&rsquo;s functions. As part of the appointment process, the Minister will invite submissions from interested organisations and individuals with regard to the appointment of four of the ten ordinary members. Existing disbursement board members are eligible for re-appointment to the new board. The terms of office of board members are set at a maximum of five years for the chairperson and three years for other members. Other provisions relating to conditions of office, filling of casual vacancies, meetings and procedure, membership of the Oireachtas, the European <Col N="36" />Parliament or local authorities, and disclosure of interest remain as they were for the former board.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides in section 8, the new Part 6, for two stages in the process whereby decisions on spending from the fund will be made. First, provision is made in section 42 of Part 6 for the preparation and submission for the Minister&rsquo;s approval, not later than 1 June 2006, of the new board&rsquo;s plan for disbursement of moneys from the fund. Section 43 provides that the Minister, having consulted with other Ministers, shall, not less than once each year, make a proposal to Government concerning the programmes or types of projects for which applications for funding should be invited and the criteria to be used in assessing such applications. Spending thresholds may be applied to particular programmes or projects.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to Government approval of the proposal, the Minister, following a public process of invitations for applications, will recommend for funding a list of programmes or projects that have been assessed by or on behalf of public bodies. In addition to this process, and as previously provided for under the principal Act, the Minister has discretion to approve funding for additional programmes that comply with the core purposes of the fund. All decisions made under either of these processes will be detailed in a statement to be laid before the Oireachtas and publicised, with the disbursements routed to successful applicants through Departments.</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides that the National Treasury Management Agency will report annually on the operation of the fund to the Minister for Finance. The new board will report annually to the Minister, who will lay copies of the report before the Oireachtas. The new board&rsquo;s report will reflect the change in functions from those of the former board.</P>
      <P>Also, reflecting the changed role of the board, section 10 removes the accountability of the chairperson of the new board to the Committee of Public Accounts. The chairperson of the former board will remain accountable to the committee in respect of decisions of that board. The new board will have power to instruct the National Treasury Management Agency to make disbursements on foot of decisions made by the former board which have not been paid out on establishment of the new board and the chairperson of the new board will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of those decisions.</P>
      <P>Sections 13 to 15 make standard provisions regarding transfer of assets, liabilities and contracts to the new board, takeover of contracts and agreements, and substitution of the name of the new board in any legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>This Bill retains the ethos of the original legislation which is to ensure that the purpose of spending from the dormant accounts fund is to assist persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged, and persons with a <Col N="37" />disability. The new dormant accounts board will be assigned the key roles of independent planner and critical appraiser. These responsibilities demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a transparent and effective process. Furthermore, the Government has provided for a range of rigorous measures in the Bill to secure transparency and accessibility by ensuring that decisions on the fund are informed by the public interest, accessible to public application and fully subject to public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that there has been considerable public debate on these proposed changes, which is entirely natural and appropriate. It is my job and that of the Minister to develop legislative proposals that safeguard the public interest in the spending of these funds. It is our job as legislators to critically appraise every legislative proposal presented to us. In this case, given the vast amount of money that is to be disbursed, we must make every effort to enshrine a process in this legislation that is robustly and transparently fair and effective in providing support where it is needed most. It is imperative that the legislative arrangements for the dispersal of moneys in the dormant accounts fund have the confidence of the House, of the persons who may seek to secure support from the fund and of the public to whom this money belongs in the first place.</P>
      <P>A rigorous and detailed testing of the proposals in the Bill by this House can only serve to strengthen the legislation. I look forward to this in this debate and in the stages that will follow. Deputies will be aware that I and the Minister have been open to suggestions for improving these proposals and have sought at all stages to address all legitimate concerns that have arisen. I assure the House that we will listen closely and consider carefully all comments and suggestion made by Deputies, as we did in the Seanad. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual for spokespersons and other contributors on Second Stage to welcome a Bill and in the past I have often had occasion to do so. However, this is a Bill I do not welcome into the House. Fine Gael was in favour of the first Bill dealing with dormant accounts when it was introduced in 2001 because it thought it had a new, honest and above board approach to the distribution of these funds. We welcomed it and thought it was a new departure because we had been used to the abuse of other funds by Ministers and politicians on the Government side.</P>
      <P>I remember being in the D&aacute;il when the National Lottery Act was passed almost 20 years ago. Fine Gael was in Government at the time so it must have been 1986 or 1987. I remember that afterwards the legislation was departed from and the lottery funds became just a slush fund for various Ministers and Government supporters to distribute to their pet projects in every part of the country. The proof is there that this still goes on. I say this as a Donegal representative, like the Acting Chairperson, Deputy Keaveney. I suppose <Col N="38" />we had the good fortune to have a Minister from Donegal in charge of the relevant Department for a while. I am sure that Deputy O&rsquo;Shea would agree Donegal got the lion&rsquo;s share. We got it when Fine Gael was in Government or when a Donegal Minister was in charge of the national lottery fund.</P>
      <P>The money in the national lottery fund is not Government money, no more than is the money in the dormant accounts fund. The people who buy tickets contribute the money to the national lottery. This money and the money collected from dormant accounts, uncollected insurance policies, intestate legacies etc. is not money collected through taxation. It is just a windfall in the coffers of the Government. If we are about to follow the precedent of the national lottery, I understand why this Bill has been introduced to depart from the original intention to distribute the funds through an independent board not subject to the control of a Minister or the Government. That is the core of the Bill before us. As politicians, we know all too well that the public has become increasingly cynical about politics and politicians. This is reflected in the growing disillusionment with local representatives and low voter turnout at elections. It is also reflected in a greater public disenchantment in people&rsquo;s ability to have their voices heard.</P>
      <P>The public is not to blame for the high levels of dissatisfaction with the political process. Much of the blame lies with politicians. As a class, we must put up our hands and bear some of the responsibility. In recent weeks the political landscape has been sullied by perceived political scandals, real or otherwise. A former Minister has been jailed for corrupt practices. An allegation has been made that a major bank robbery was carried out by an organisation which has strong links with a party represented in this House. A cloud of suspicion hung over a serving Minister in regard to the awarding of lucrative public relations contracts. It is irrelevant whether these allegations can be substantiated or not, the reality is they stick in the public mind and reinforce the negative ideas which people already harbour about political representatives and the wider political process. The responsibility lies with Members of this House to clean up the sleaze and scandal which has become associated with politics but the Bill and the thinking behind it is not designed to address that.</P>
      <P>It is our duty to restore public confidence in political processes and in the supremacy of political transparency and openness. The public cannot continue to believe that cronyism is alive and well, that after years of tribunals and scandals having been exposed, nothing has really changed. Favouritism and inside dealing cannot be allowed to continue after years of tribunals. That train of thought brings me to the Bill before us. Unfortunately the tone and content of it does nothing but reinforce all the negative aspects of politics. It harks back to another era and smacks of cronyism of the highest order. The possibility of dubious <Col N="39" />political processes and a lack of accountability are all present in this Bill and it will do nothing but further undermine public confidence in the lack of fairness and equity in the spending and allocation of public finances.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a prime example of an underhand attempt by the Government to put its hand in the cookie jar and take out the treats contained in the dormant accounts fund and use these significant funds for its own benefit. It is clear the bottom line agenda, no matter how the Minister will try to justify it, is that two years away from an election the Government hopes to buy the election by flashing the cash and giving to its own pet projects. The fund will be used to extinguish bushfires between now and the election. The result will be that those groups, often the most marginalised and disadvantaged, which for whatever reason are not regarded by Fianna F&aacute;il election strategists as key vote-gaining targets, will be bypassed, overlooked and ignored. It is also likely that other community groups which do not find political favour with the Government will lose out when the decisions on to whom and what to allocate this money are taken. This process of favouritism is already well entrenched within the Department by the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
      <P>My colleague and spokesperson on Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Stanton, met with members of the Community Workers Co-Op who have had their core funding removed because they disagreed publicly with the policies of the Government. If one criticises the Government or any aspect of the polity one will be penalised. The lesson has not been lost on the community and voluntary sector. The message coming from the Government appears to be that it does not allocate funding to groups on merit or on the grounds of fairness and transparency. The message is that those who dare to bite the hand which feeds it face severe punishment. This is unacceptable behaviour on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>The sum of money contained in the dormant accounts fund is not to be sniffed at. It is a rolling fund and is likely to yield hundreds of millions of euro for years to come. The fund contains almost &euro;200 million. The Minister referred to over &euro;200 million and it could rise significantly. A figure of over &euro;400 million has been mentioned, but the reality is that it is likely to be a great deal more than that, as the amount in unclaimed bank accounts and life insurance rises each year. We have no way of knowing how much money the fund will eventually yield. However, we can be certain that the money it contains should and must go to the most disadvantaged and worthy in society.</P>
      <P>The community and voluntary sector continues to be one of the most underfunded sectors in society. It continues to make a significant, and often largely unrewarded, contribution to the community. It is only right and proper that money from the dormant accounts fund should go to such groups. This money has been allocated <Col N="40" />to projects that are attempting to improve community life in the areas in which they operate. Projects which have benefited from the fund include the building of a care centre and sheltered housing in County Donegal, the provision of training for three women&rsquo;s health projects in Kilbarrack, Dublin, and the provision of a lifelong learning centre for people with disabilities in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. We welcome the fact that a significant amount of money has been distributed. We are not critical of this. These are but a few examples of the projects which have benefited from the fund and are typical examples of sectors in society which the Government has neglected in recent years.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that we are talking about the same projects and community groups which were so delighted with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement before the general election in 2002 that the RAPID scheme would fasttrack &euro;2 billion in funding into our most disadvantaged communities. The reality has been very different. Very little money has been fasttracked to disadvantaged communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of it was already committed to these communities and very little additional money has been channelled through RAPID. It appears that through this legislation the Government is attempting to pull a second quick stroke on disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>The legislation attempts to undermine the process of ensuring that the moneys contained in the dormant accounts fund are allocated to communities on the ground in a manner which is beyond question and above suspicion. The enabling legislation which led to the creation of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board sought to create a safe, secure and foolproof system. The board was established in June 2002 and since then it has presided over numerous allocations of funding to worthy community groups, initiatives and projects that so desperately needed support. The Minister has argued that the board cannot cope with its workload. He commented last year that the changes were proposed only when the Government realised how much money the fund would contain. What point was the Minister making? Is it that he and his colleagues suddenly became interested in the money once they realised how much was involved and the potential it offered them to buy votes? He will rattle off comments about the board being incapable of handling such large amounts of money or other dubious reasons such as an inadequate amount of staff. This is an attempt by the Government to conceal its own greed. Government members are licking their lips in anticipation of having a slush fund of hundreds of millions of euro at their disposal in the run-up to the next election.</P>
      <P>The time is long overdue to debunk these ridiculous myths and half-truths by this greedy <Col N="41" />Government. When one examines the alleged inability of the board to distribute the moneys, there is no evidence to substantiate the Minister&rsquo;s ludicrous claim.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has also claimed that the board is spending too much on administrative costs and would save money if the functions were to be carried out by existing public servants. This does not bear up to scrutiny. Public servants can be transferred from one Department or another to assist the board.</P>
      <P>The existing board is well fit and qualified to decide when and how this money should be distributed. In the space of a year, the board successfully and with apparent ease distributed more than &euro;40 million in dormant funds. I am not aware of any problems, allegations of misconduct or lack of transparency by anyone in regard to these allocations. Some &euro;40 million in the space of a year is no small sum and yet the Minister of State appears to want to sully the good name and create doubts about the ability of the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is a member of a Government which itself wasted more than &euro;50 million on the now defunct electronic voting proposals and tens of millions of euro on the vainglorious &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; and is therefore certainly in no position to give accountancy lessons to anyone. I do not need to remind the House of the most recent injustice and act of greed carried out by this Government when it knowingly robbed elderly people in public nursing homes. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v should not lecture this House about poor accounting.</P>
      <P>The second myth which is spread by this Government to smooth its transition to a position where it can enrich its own political agenda at the expense of others is the falsehood that the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board lacks sufficient staff. There has never been any difficulty in transferring public servants from the sponsoring Department when any new public body or structure has been put in place in recent times. This is standard reason trotted out by the Minister but it is one which does not hold water. There is no reason additional administrative staff cannot be allocated to the board to allow it to deal with its workload.</P>
      <P>It is also worth remembering that the board has engaged Area Development Management Limited to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. ADM is a non-profit making organisation which has wide experience in managing programmes targeted at countering disadvantage and exclusion such as the rural transport initiative and the RAPID and PEACE II programmes. It is evident that the picture painted by the Minister of a dormant accounts fund board which is adrift, out of its depth and struggling to cope could not be further from the truth. It is nothing more than another desperate attempt by this Government to create a smokescreen and distort the facts.</P>
      <Col N="42" />
      <P>The most fundamental element of this legislation lies in the provision which relates to who will decide where dormant fund moneys are allocated and to whom. This legislation will change from the current position whereby the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board takes such decisions, subject to the passive approval of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This legislation will mean that the Government will now take such decisions, with the money going to each Minister and their Department for his or her ultimate discretion to decide what project will receive grace from the Government and will get this vital funding lifeline.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I cannot see how even this will work. The image which comes to mind is one of a Government charged with the task of collectively deciding what moneys go where, but with each Minister pressing for support for his or her own pet project. It is difficult to see how any decisions will be made about this money and even more difficult not to envisage open disputes and rivalries among Cabinet Ministers on who gets what. These tensions are likely to get worse as Ministers, in a bid to retain their seats in a general election year, jockey with one another to get money for their areas. It is laughable that the Minister should suggest that this legislation will put a better system in place. The question is better for whom? It is certainly not the disadvantaged or those who need this money.</P>
      <P>If the Minister&rsquo;s utterances on this significant change are anything to go by, he himself cannot even defend the logic of the decision. Perhaps he is under pressure from his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that they get their hands on the pie too. In early 2004, when this Bill was first published, the Minister defended its rationale on the basis that the money involved was simply too much for the board to handle. Despite this, in only a few short weeks, after doubting the ability of the board to handle such large funds, the Minister appeared to contradict himself completely. By announcing that he was empowering the board to double the amount of money it allocated in 2004, from &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million, the Minister had contradicted himself. There appears to be no logic in his public utterances. He is seeking to limit the power of the board on the one hand and, on the other, expand the amount of money it distributes. It does not make sense. The Minister does not appear to believe what he is saying himself. One can only conclude that he is under pressure from his Cabinet colleagues to put in place arrangements to allow them to get their hands on the dormant funds.</P>
      <P>The moneys contained in the dormant accounts fund must be beyond question, transparent and fairly and equitably distributed. The Government is on the record as supporting such a need for transparency in the distribution of the dormant funds. When the legislation to establish the existing structures passed through this House in November 2001, the then Minister for Finance, <Col N="43" />former Deputy McCreevy, reiterated the need for transparency. He said:</P>
      <P LI="1">To get away from the problem of having the Government blamed as having a slush fund, it has been decided to establish a board of trustees. This board will distribute the money, subject to guidelines and without the direction from the Government. This will get away from the problems of having Ministers accused of favouring pet projects ... that the best approach was to give the power to distribute it to a disbursals board and not to the Minister. It was a decision I took and I think that it is the safest one in the circumstances.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This was the Minister for Finance who was responsible for introducing the first Dormant Accounts Bill. The Minister for Finance was clear in his support that the money should be distributed &ldquo;without the direction from the Government&rdquo;. That was the position in 2001 when the Bill was introduced and this Bill fundamentally changes that philosophy and the money will now be at the disposal of the Government. What has changed? I call on the Minister to explain to the House why he and his colleagues now propose to direct these funds to their pet projects. This is an unjustified and a dangerous U-turn. It smacks of cronyism of the highest level. The words of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, are completely worthless.</P>
      <P>The Government has lost its self-restraint. It is no longer even attempting to hide its desire to make decisions based on its own self-interest as a political party than as a Government serving the best interests of the public. The legislation before us today is little more than a shameful attempt by the Government to cover up the Fianna F&aacute;il mentality of pursuing its own survival above all else. None of us could have better summed up this political philosophy better than the Taoiseach when he declared: &ldquo;The code of ethics is for those of us who are in here to try to stay in here.&rdquo; I am sure the Minister of State remembers that quote too.</P>

      <P>The message is clear: Fianna F&aacute;il is prepared to distort the good workings of the dormant accounts fund and its board for its own ends. That is the crux and core of the matter. That very philosophy is the real reason for this legislation. We are now less than two years away from a general election and it is clear that the need to start granting political favours is a high priority in the minds of many Government members. The decision taken to double the amount to be distributed from &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million was likely connected to the then upcoming local elections in June 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been set out in the disbursement plan, drawn up the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board and approved by the Minister, that 40% of the moneys should go to disadvantaged areas, 25% to tackle educational disadvantage and 25% to fund disability projects and initiatives. If the Bill is passed, no guarantee exists that this money will go to these areas or to projects and organisations best positioned to ensure maximum delivery from such funding. The Fine Gael Party does not support this attempt to distort the workings of the dormant accounts fund. We have confidence in the existing board and its distribution structures. They work well and the board must be allowed to continue to fulfil the mandate given to it. If it is working efficiently, why change it? I have exposed the reasons.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to fulfil the original tenets of the legislation. He must ensure that concerns raised by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, that the fund could be open to allegations of abuse are not realised. There is a real danger that the moneys will become nothing more than a political slush fund, open to abuse, maladministration and cronyism. The Minister must act in a responsible manner by withdrawing the legislation to ensure the integrity of the fund&rsquo;s distribution is upheld. The existing system is fast, efficient, working and transparent. The Minister must uphold this transparency and not let the fund fall prey to political considerations. He has a duty to ensure that it goes to those most worthy of it.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable that the Progressive Democrats, the other party in Government, tolerates such an approach. Obviously, it is contaminated too. I recall the T&aacute;naiste in a previous life promising to amend and improve the disbursement of lottery funds. This has never happened even though she has been in Cabinet for seven years. The dormant accounts fund will be treated in a similar manner. It is not fair to those who left those moneys in banks or other saving institutions, did not collect insurance policies or died intestate. It was not their intention that moneys left behind would become a slush fund for a Government to buy votes in elections. For that reason, the Fine Gael Party opposes the Bill.</P>

      <P>T&aacute;&aacute;thas orm an seans a fh&aacute;il labhairt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an mBille um Chuntais Dh&iacute;omhaoine (Leas&uacute;) 2004. On 16 December 2003, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government gave itself a massive Christmas present. It reviewed arrangements for dormant accounts &ldquo;in the context of ensuring appropriate capacity to evaluate and process applications in the light of the emerging scale of the fund&rdquo;. The key phrase in this statement is &ldquo;in the light of the emerging scale of the fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <Col N="45" />
      <P>The Government was agreeably surprised by the amount of moneys available in the fund. The first moneys, amounting to &euro;196.2 million, were transferred from credit institutions to the dormant accounts fund at the end of April 2003. The National Treasury Management Agency, which has responsibility for managing the fund, determined that 15% of the total fund should be kept in a reserve account to provide for the right of reclaim for account holders whose funds had been transferred. The 2003 annual report of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board states: &ldquo;To date account holders have reclaimed approximately &euro;24 million from the fund.&rdquo; Interest earned from the fund&rsquo;s investment came to approximately &euro;2.75 million. The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, alluded to the running costs. The 2003 annual report states that the running costs came to &euro;148,000. As some of these costs were one-off and involved setting up the board, such a figure is not that large. If the size of the board is increased, economies of scale will kick in. I am convinced that when the Government saw this significant and potential slush fund of approximately &euro;200 million, it simply grabbed it.</P>

      <P>The key phrase in the annual report&rsquo;s section dealing with the changes to the role and remit of the board is &ldquo;in the light of the emerging scale of the fund&rdquo;. If the sum of money available was less, the Government would not have shown as much interest in how it was administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With a larger fund, one needs a more watertight system of administration. It is not what the Deputy is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the Minister&rsquo;s claim. If the fund is larger, it requires more administrative staff. However, it was not required to change how decisions are made on the fund. The Government is attempting to take this role on itself. No Member can convince me that this was not done for blatant political purposes.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is enacted, from its commencement date to the expected date of the general election in 2007, the Government will have many bites of the cherry to buy votes through the fund. The reason for the establishment of the fund and its objectives are admirable. However, the Government came on this crock of gold and decided to grab it for its political purposes. The Bill is a backward step for our democracy. People, particularly the young, already feel cynical towards politics. When an Administration is in power too long, it becomes arrogant. It cannot see how its actions will be rightly interpreted by the public. The Bill can only be interpreted as a blatant attempt by the Government to ensure every possible vote will be squeezed out of the fund. <Col N="46" />Instead of an objective and independent method of disbursing the moneys, a partisan system will be put in place. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, can now inform the Government of his recommended allocations. Every Cabinet Member will have his or her pet projects. What will emerge in the end will display this approach. I am not seeking to be righteous, but if the Bill is passed into law, whatever Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs replaces the current Minister, or whatever administration replaces the current Administration, there will be a temptation to allocate the money along purely partisan lines. I am not saying that people will not act differently in the future. However, we have a huge responsibility in how this House is perceived because of what has emerged from the tribunals. People see this House as some necessary evil at best but, by and large, there is very little admiration for public representatives today. That is not to say that there are not many admirable people in the House, but we must do a bit more than we are currently doing if we are to win back the respect this Parliament deserves. This legislation is going totally and utterly in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McGinley said, we are expected to oppose legislation from this side of the House. However, on this occasion, both Deputy McGinley and I are speaking as responsible Members of the House in the firm belief that if this legislation passes into law, it will do huge damage once again to the perception of the honourable way Members of the House should act. As the 15 members of the Cabinet cannot represent each constituency and county, what will inevitably happen is that there will be a lopsided allocation of moneys because of the way the divvy up will happen at Cabinet. The legislation proposes to put in place a very unfair system. There is currently a senior Minister in my constituency but that had not been the case for a long time. The constituencies who have Ministers will do better and areas that do not have that kind of representation will suffer. If this is how we handle our democracy, can we complain if people perceive us as operating in a self-interested way where we will flog out the money so that we retain our seats? Taking into consideration the population at large, we are not doing what we should be doing.</P>
      <P>The board will be increased from nine members to 11. This will include the chairperson and ten members as opposed to the chairperson and eight members. What always amuses me about this type of legislation is that there is no mention of financial implications. If the final processing of the applications takes place within the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and the present administration is being carried by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, the staff in the Department will be diverted from other activities which will result in an overall cost. There are financial implications. The cost is now being borne by the fund but if the Bill becomes law, it will be borne by the <Col N="47" />Department. I cannot understand how this will not have financial implications. I would like the Minister of State to address this issue.</P>
      <P>We are being presented with an either-or situation by the Minister of State. We cannot have the present structure because the fund is so large we must go down the road of allowing the Cabinet to make, in secret, uninhibited decisions on where they may be spent. On Committee Stage, I will return with suggestions on how the present board could be changed so that it could do the job in a way that would be clearly independent, clearly removed from political influence is as much as the Minister of the day will appoint the members of the board.</P>
      <P>It was rather touching when the Minister of State said that the Minister would place an advertisement in the newspapers inviting submissions from people, that they would be alerted to the fact that the board was being be set up and the Minister would have regard to the submissions. The Minister of State and I know that is not the case because people will be selected. Whatever Government is in place will select people who are favourable to its political parties. This may not be a direct influence, but it is an influence. I would be the first to admit that it is very difficult to come up with a method whereby one could put together a board which would be truly impartial. Given my experience, the road to travel is not the road of having nominees from various organisations because one could end up with people who are good at getting themselves elected rather than people who can do the job effectively. It is not an easy task to put together such a board.</P>
      <P>At this stage I can think of nothing better than the Minister appointing the boards. I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Noel Ahern, would be sincere in appointing a board that would work in the overall interest, therefore, he would appoint people who could do the job. However, there is a perception that the Government will not appoint a board which is made up of a majority of people who would be well known for opposing the Government &mdash; this is not the way the world works. In the end, it is preferable that a board which is independent in its functions deals with this large sum of money to achieve the objectives in the strategy with which the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board has come forward.</P>
      <P>I believe we have reached a watershed. For instance, there is the lottery money, and if any of us were asked in court to swear as to how impartial the allocation of that money is, I do not know of anyone who could say it is allocated impartially. Let us be honest, it is an existing slush fund, and my genuine fear is that we now want to create a similar fund whereby the guiding force is constituency interests or a general interest in a national body and so on. In the main, the guiding force in terms of decisions made will be the self-interest of the particular constituency. The explanatory and financial memorandum notes: <Col N="48" />&ldquo;the Bill provides for a two-stage process whereby decisions on spending from the fund will be made by Government following a transparent process of inviting applications for programmes and types of projects&rdquo;. In the name of God, inserting the word &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; in that context is disingenuous. There is no process by which applications are invited to allow for any significant concealment. To promise transparency with regard to inviting applications is mind-boggling. At the end of the day, the basic concept should always be that the citizens at large are invited to make applications. The word &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; is planted there to give an impression that everything will be transparent.</P>
      <P>The memorandum continues: &ldquo;Having regard to the dormant accounts disbursement plan and following consultation with other Ministers, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will, in the first instance, submit, at least annually, a proposal to Government regarding the programmes and types of projects for funding following the completion of the assessment of applications.&rdquo; I take that to clearly mean that the assessment of applications in the first instance will be carried out within the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the direction of the Minister, who will have consulted with other colleagues who, I would suggest, might not be as concerned about the projects relating to their Departments as much as about their own pet projects on the home front.</P>
      <P>The memorandum says that a list of recommended projects will be submitted to the Government for approval. That is to be done by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The memorandum then says that a list of all successful applications as approved by Government will be published along with the amounts involved in each case. This too is drivel. The bottom line is that we will see the list and will know who has been successful, who has got money and who did not get money. We can then make our own deductions as to where money has gone and whose influence was involved. To give the impression that this is a transparent, open process is nonsense. The only way to ensure transparency would be to list the unsuccessful applications along with the successful ones and provide a report as to why certain applications were successful and others were not. That is the sort of information that would be available if we were talking about a true system of transparency and openness but that is not what is happening here.</P>
      <P>The way this section is drafted is meant to convey one idea with regard to what will happen, namely the two-stage process. However, while the new board of ten and one will list the types of programmes and projects that should be funded, it is the Government that will decide. The invitations will be sought from the Minister&rsquo;s Department. It amused me to read that the board was being given important functions. The language was crafted to disguise the real issue, which <Col N="49" />is that the only decision that matters is being taken away from the board. That is the final decision on where the money should go and who should get it.</P>
      <P>To tell Deputies these very important functions are being given to the new board is to treat us as fools. The board is losing the only real power it has. I accept the sincerity of the Minister of State in rejecting the arguments made on this side of the House but I ask him to look at the matter between now and Committee Stage. I am pleased the Minister of State is open to new suggestions and I know he will honour his promise. I know any amendments tabled on this side of the House that are seen to be superior to any current provisions of the Bill will be accepted. That is welcome. My problem is that the Minister of State believes that going ahead with this Bill is the right way to proceed. Not many people believe that. No doubt those on the Government side do but I suggest that this belief is very much in the context of winning the next general election and using &euro;200 million of the taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
      <P>I know that for particular reasons the fund is to be disbursed at a rate of &euro;30 million per annum and I do not suggest the entire &euro;200 million will be allocated in one go. The reasons for keeping the money in any particular year to a level of &euro;30 million is a budgetary concept in terms of the Exchequer and the finances of the State at large. However, if this Bill becomes law, the Government could well be tempted to decide that the figure of &euro;30 million is a little bare, and since the election might be just a year away it could decide to increase the figure to &euro;50 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>To continue with my point, this is an abuse of very substantial public funds. Nothing is easier in this House than to oppose legislation brought forward by the Government. I have seen polls and heard people&rsquo;s views. I understand that some polling was done in my area &mdash; though I am not quite convinced of that &mdash; to show that politicians are very badly regarded. I ask the Minister to consider this matter again between now and Committee Stage. It is difficult for all of us to be objective but what is proposed will do substantial damage to the body politic. If there were a system in the Bill which would allow for <Col N="50" />these funds to be allocated in a fair, non-partisan manner, I would be the first to support it and to encourage the disbursement of the money for projects as quickly as possible. That is not what we have in front of us. Instead we have a brazen, barefaced attempt to turn around a publicly-owned fund targeted at proper and desirable objectives. It is difficult to understand why the Government does not concede what is happening. It might be much better if it admitted what it was doing, saying that the Opposition would do the same if in power, though that is no argument. As I said, ultimately, I have no reason to believe that if this legislation were there for the next administration or the one after, it would be used in the same extremely partisan manner. Our duty extends beyond the next general election and the interest of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats in buying it. We are talking about legislation that will remain on the Statute Book in perpetuity. No one is clamouring to have the legislation regarding the national lottery changed in any way. Once such measures pass into law, it is extremely difficult, bearing in mind the culture of this House, to introduce changes. We must, therefore, get it right this time. We owe it to the young people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>They got it right the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the Government decided, for the worst of reasons, that the approach would be changed, and that is essentially what Deputy McGinley and I are saying.</P>
      <P>Calling a spade a spade, this legislation is disgraceful. It is shameful for the Government parties to bring such legislation before the D&aacute;il. I put it very sincerely to the Minister that there is a need for a rethink regarding this legislation. I am totally opposed to it as it stands. It should either be withdrawn or changed substantially. The one issue of any real importance that must be addressed is that under the Constitution the right must be removed from the Cabinet to allocate those funds to the various areas.</P>
      <P>I look at the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who announced the rural social scheme in the budget before last and then told us that he would raid &euro;10 million from the dormant accounts fund to pay for it. I understand that of the 2,500 places there are now only approximately 900. Be that as it may; I welcome the initiative of that payment. In the context of rural Ireland, we must do much more in that vein. I found it most distasteful that the fund was hardly in being when the senior Minister of the day decided he would raid it. That money should have come from Exchequer funds. It is fundamentally wrong to take money out of a fund to help launch and finance a new scheme that in the fullness of time will in any case have to be funded from the Exchequer. The alternative, though there is no indication of it, is that the Minister believes that the dormant accounts fund should continue to shell out in perpetuity to keep <Col N="51" />the scheme in question going. I re-emphasise that the scheme is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in accordance with the core principles of the first plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of dispute. The fact that such a substantial amount was removed is where my problem lies. Would that same &euro;10 million, if allocated to rural problems and projects around the country, make a bigger impact regarding those whom we wish to help? The plans for this fund did not envisage that large amounts of money would be siphoned off for national programmes. I view it as relating more to particular areas, and perhaps to regions in some instances. Funding should be more of the one-off type. However, as has happened with much of the lottery money, it becomes recurrent funding that absolutely paralyses the possibility of health boards, for instance, taking on new projects. Certain very desirable schemes now depend on lottery money every year to pay for their core functions.</P>

      <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is one of the newer ones and as a result may not have gathered a sufficient head of steam to produce more than its share of legislation in the House. In this 29th D&aacute;il, we have seen only a handful of Bills, such as the Bille teanga and a functions Bill regarding how the Minister was meant to be running his Department and granting him certain powers. It is somewhat strange that, even at this early stage in the life of this 29th D&aacute;il, we are revisiting a Bill, albeit one originally introduced by the Minister for Finance. It says much of the Government&rsquo;s sense of priorities that we are amending this Bill when there are others within the remit of the Department that those of us on this side of the House and many outside this Chamber would like to see given greater priority. In citing that example, off the top of my head I could ask why there has been such a delay on the charities Bill, which could radically reform legislation on community and voluntary organisations. It should be before this House, discussed, debated and implemented into law.</P>
      <P>Instead the Government is introducing an amendment Bill. If one considers the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme and progress since June 2002, one suspects that the number of amendment Bills in this D&aacute;il has been far higher than in any other. It seems that the amendment Bills have arisen for two reasons. Many of them have had to be introduced on an emergency basis, since the Government, in the way it put the legis<Col N="52" />lation through the House in the first place, failed to ensure that it received proper scrutiny, despite arguments from this side of the House. Those Bills were subsequently shown by the courts system to be legally flawed. The second, more insidious reason is that the Government has sought to change legislation to its own political advantage within a very short time period. This Bill is one of the crasser examples.</P>
      <P>As someone who has worked in the community and voluntary sector for a long time, I have many reservations about the existence of separate accounts meaning that services provided in that sector cannot get the proper recognition they deserve from the State regarding guaranteed Exchequer and multi-annual funding. These special funds &mdash; the national lottery was the first obvious example &mdash; tend to represent a sticking-plaster approach towards the funding needs of many voluntary organisations. They are given in such piecemeal fashion that, even where an independent structure is involved, there is meant to be some sense of obligation to the political patronage of the Government of the time. That is no way to recognise the voluntary sector, on which we still depend to a far greater extent than any comparable European country. We get our social services on the cheap and reward providers by playing silly political games, establishing funds on which people depend but which do not even meet their everyday needs. The Government, through its political philosophy, is especially guilty of that. It cannot be argued that the original legislation introduced by the former Minister for Finance, the establishment of the board and the subsequent distribution of those funds was everything Members of this House and those outside it hoped it would be. There was a necessary degree of independence and a fair distribution of funds to particular groupings throughout the country. The new suggested structure involving the dismantling of the board and the establishment of a new board, and the degree to which the Minister is being put into the picture in terms of approving an overall plan, being able to alter such a plan and come up with a subsequent one by consulting his Cabinet colleagues, will be overtly politically influenced.</P>
      <P>It is no coincidence that this change is being proposed half-way into the life of the 29th D&aacute;il when we are now in the electoral cycle towards the election of the 30th D&aacute;il. The Government might think it is a wheeze to suggest these changes that allow access to the fund are being made for its own naked political advantage so that it can buy largesse among the electorate which, in the previous election, showed what it thought of its overall policies.</P>
      <P>A much more sinister aspect needs to be portrayed, and I was glad to hear it mentioned in earlier contributions. Not only does the Government want control of funds of this nature and not want the voluntary sector to be brought into a system in which it does not depend on political largesse but is instead guaranteed that its needs <Col N="53" />for the services it provides will be met through Exchequer and multi-annual funding, the Government has since intervened to introduce the principle that if community and voluntary organisations do not tow the line and do what the Government expects them to do, and if they even go so far as to point out the effects of Government policies in many disadvantaged communities, it reserves upon itself the right to pull the plug on the funding. That was seen recently in the decision to refuse funding for the Community Workers Co-operative. Its only crime appears to be that it is working in disadvantaged communities and operating the basic principles of community development to empower people to identify their needs and try to have those needs met first within their own resources and subsequently from the agencies of the State. Its wants to ensure their needs are met to the same extent as any other citizen. The naked political nature of that decision cannot go unprotested. It has inculcated fear in the community and voluntary sector that future Government funding will be dependent on the extent to which such organisations tow the line in terms of the political philosophy of the Government which, as I stressed in other contributions, appears to derive from a Victorian notion of the deserving poor.</P>
      <P>If the Government is not prepared to face up to the fact that it is not really concerned about community development but is only playing political games by shifting funds it believes give the maximum effect, I warn it that despite the access to such a large amount of money, it runs the risk in the election for the 30th D&aacute;il of being seen to be as cynical as many of us on this side of the House already believe. It is not enough to say that money will be made available in a kind of utilitarian way and that those who are happy for most of the time will mean there will be a continuance of this particular Government. It is very unhealthy in terms of the way we want to develop our democratic system to think that when Governments change, as they should and must and I hope this one will after the next general election, the systems will be in place for those who enter Government to play the same game. That is the reason there is a responsibility on us to examine this legislation. My inclination is to reject it outright because if the legislation is to be changed, it should be in such a way that it becomes more difficult for anyone in the political system, be they a political party or individual politician, to take advantage of such a fund and the political uses to which it can be put.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, when he returns to the Chamber, and the Minister might argue that they are sincere in their intentions but this is legislation that confers power not only on the individuals in office at that Department but all those who subsequently hold that office. It would be remiss of us to grant such powers to a future Minister and the future intentions he or she might have to use such a large sum of money.</P>
      <Col N="54" />
      <P>I cannot stress strongly enough my opposition and that of my party to the Bill, an opposition I am glad to see is shared by Members of the Opposition. I appeal to those in Government, particularly those who have experience of the community and voluntary sector, to recognise this nakedly cynical exercise for what it is and react with whatever shred of conscience exists among them. They should put to rest once and for all the type of State interaction with the community and voluntary sector that results in those who provide the services we need in our society feeling beholden to our political system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member of this House recognises that the decision to use the dormant accounts fund for public benefit was a positive and welcome development. It is far better that these funds be used to target disadvantage in our society than to remain dormant in some sort of never-never land where they would only benefit the financial institutions that held them.</P>
      <P>On 7 January the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board announced that its latest list of grants approved totals approximately &euro;12.2 million. All those projects are worthy of support and clearly fall within the criteria of social and economic disadvantage, educational disadvantage and disabilities. In my constituency, the Tallaght Centre for the Unemployed will receive a grant for a play bus and I understand funding is also available for a family support model in Jobstown.</P>
      <P>The fund is designed to assist communities in sectors of society affected by those forms of disadvantage, but some of the projects stretch that definition somewhat. However, they are all deserving projects. I suppose the Minister would call on me to name those that are not deserving but some of them do stretch the area of credibility. The approach taken with these funds appears to be to disburse them as widely as possible. Given that the fund is limited and will eventually run out, is this the best course to follow? Would it be better to target specific areas of disadvantage or a particular need in disadvantaged communities, for example, play facilities for children or recreation facilities for young people rather than the sort of scattered approach that appears to be adopted? I accept the fund is weighted towards RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas, and rightly so, but I am concerned that the Government is not making the best possible use of it for maximum long-term benefit. As other speakers said, it is a specific fund but it will run out at some stage.</P>
      <P>Some of these grants will go to local authorities for developing recreation facilities, open spaces or play facilities, but what happens to those facilities when the money runs out? In my own area funding was allocated for a playground but the difficulty was that no one was appointed to open and close the playground. For nearly two or three years we had a playground which the children could not use, which was like waving sweets in <Col N="55" />front of children. Subsequently, somebody set fire to many of the facilities in the playground.</P>
      <P>If local authorities were adequately funded, Dundalk Town Council, for example, would not have had to apply to this fund to develop playground facilities. It would provide these facilities, as would all local authorities. It is wrong of the Government to hold up this measure as a major contribution to addressing inequality. I agree with Deputy Boyle that it is a sticking plaster approach to the problem and should not be a supplement to long-term programmes that should be in place. Those programmes are not in place, however, and as a result, as exposed in a major report published last week, some 15% of children under 15 are affected by poverty.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>To address that inequality we need policy change grounded on a rights based ethos. Massive improvements in education provision and targeted training and employment for disadvantaged areas and an equitable health system are needed. This fund is no substitute for those fundamental reforms. Without these changes, people will continue to receive only crumbs from the table.</P>
      <P>My points relate to the fund, as it stands. Overall, I do not have a difficulty with the way it was administrated. However, I have a major problem with the changes proposed in the Bill. The Minister and the Government are giving themselves increased powers in terms of deciding which projects should or should not receive grants. That is a definite step backwards. The dormant accounts fund has been described as a slush fund or a possible election treasure trove. People can call it what they will. The Government defends it by stating that they are obliged to adhere to strict conditions but the fact remains that, under the legislation, the final say rests with the Minister. He will be presented with a list of projects and he will have the power to grant funding to some but not to others. We are creating a similar situation to that which obtains in respect of sports capital grants, in respect of which the relevant Minister has even more power in terms of doling out the goodies.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, the Minister must have regard to the plan for disbursement presented annually by the board. However, he will not be obliged to abide by it and the final say in respect of all projects will rest with him. This is not a personal criticism of the Minister; it could apply to any of his counterparts.</P>
      <P>The second major difficulty with the Bill relates to the appointment of the board. We have again been presented with legislation under which all members of a board will be ministerial appointees. Provision is not made for application or open competition for these places. It is disgraceful that provision is not made for representation on the board from those working in the community and voluntary sector. Involvement of such people would strengthen the board because it is that sector which administrates these funds <Col N="56" />when they are allocated. These individuals work in youth centres, playgroups, adult education groups, disability groups, etc., but they have no say in planning where funding should go. They should have a real and direct input into the annual disbursement plans but it appears the Government wants to hold all the strings.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued that he should have a say in this and so on. I see this in the same light as the decision to cut off funding for the community workers co-op to which Deputy Boyle referred. It seems the Government wants to keep all community groups in their local boxes in order that they will not communicate with each other and develop a common approach. The Government will, therefore, not be obliged to come to terms with any real alternative approach to its social policies. The Minister stated, in respect of the community co-op, that community groups and workers were represented. That is nonsense, particularly if one considers the work that was being done. The work to which I refer involved co-ordination and establishing links between different groups, which is vital in the community sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister defends the Bill by stating that the fund must be administered. Nobody objects to the fund being administrated more efficiently and in a more accountable manner. However, he and the Government are treating the fund like a bag of goodies to be handed out. Government Deputies will parade around constituencies boasting about their generosity and that of the Minister. We have seen this before. They act as if it is their money and as if they are giving it away out of the goodness of their hearts. This is people&rsquo;s money and it should be used in a properly planned, fair, accountable and effective way. The type of behaviour to which I refer demeans not only those who engage in it but also politics and politicians in general.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a recipe for poor planning, unfairness, unaccountability and ineffectiveness. The Government&rsquo;s approach will become more piecemeal and more open to favouritism. I may be wrong but that is my reading of the Bill. I remind the Government of what the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated when the original legislation to establish the fund was introduced in 2002, namely:</P>
      <P LI="1">To get away from the problem of having the Government blamed as having a slush fund, it has been decided to establish a board of trustees. This board will distribute the money, subject to guidelines and without the direction from the Government.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We are now moving the goalposts. What Deputy McCreevy said was somewhat rich, given that Punchestown was his pet project. However, he clearly identified the need for independence from Government. This has now been thrown out the window and the dormant accounts fund is being treated like a pork barrel, as they say in America. What we are seeing is pork barrel politics. The <Col N="57" />dormant accounts fund is a slush fund. The Bill should be withdrawn and the Minister should listen to the Opposition and those working in the community sector. If it is not withdrawn, we will have no choice but to reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill, which is important legislation. This debate should form part of our efforts to redress the balance and divert funds to the most needy in our society. This legislation is a wealth tax and it is important that the additional resources to which it will give rise will be directed towards the disadvantaged and services for people with disabilities. We should not be behind the door and I demand that the extra revenue that will accrue should be pumped into the areas of most need. Again, however, I warn of wastage.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend existing dormant accounts legislation, principally in respect of decisions on disbursements from the dormant accounts fund and also the role of the dormant accounts fund disbursals board. The objectives underpinning disbursements from the fund will, in a move I support, remain unchanged. These core objectives are to assist persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged or who have a disability. These objectives are an important part of the strategy. I make no apologies for taking money from the fund and spending it in the areas to which I refer.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the position of the economically and educationally disadvantaged. We must roll up our sleeves and take action. There is no point trying to make up figures about poverty and disadvantage. The priority in this State is the 66,000 children living in extreme poverty. Surely the Government can take action in terms of reducing that figure. I have put a number of proposals to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, in respect of this issue and I understand he has stated on a number of occasions that his door is open to those who make constructive suggestions. In that context, I reiterate that we must target the 66,000 children living in poverty.</P>
      <P>The second priority must be to deal with those children whose families have low incomes. Resources must be targeted at these families. There is no point in spreading the wealth around willy-nilly. If we do not take action in respect of educational disadvantage and poverty, we will damage society &mdash; particularly young people and children &mdash; and be obliged to spend more money to build additional prisons.</P>
      <P>On the subject of child poverty, I strongly disagree with Dr. Ed Walsh of the University of Limerick who commented in recent days on single parents and their connection with crime and poverty. I worked in the inner city for 20 years and I served as principal of a small school in an extremely disadvantaged area. The school in question was one of the poorest in the country. It was assessed by the Combat Poverty Agency and <Col N="58" />was listed as one of the 33 most needy in the State. However, I had an extremely positive experience with the single parents whose children attended the school. I would not have been able to run the school without the help of the parents&rsquo; council, on which many single parents served and did a great job. These people lived in blocks of flats where addicts shot up heroin in stairwells. However, their children came to school every day, dressed in their uniforms and with their homework done. These children were described as disadvantaged. Their parents played a blinder in their community and also in terms of being a back-up resource for me in the school. I challenge Dr. Walsh&rsquo;s assertions and I question his statistics and analysis. I accept that there are dysfunctional children in single parent families. However, there are also dysfunctional children in so-called two-parent families.</P>
      <P>If we target the resources early, we can stop crime and eliminate disadvantage. It is important that if resources are being disbursed, particularly in the educational field, children between two and five years of age are targeted. There is no point in tackling the problem when they are in fifth and sixth classes and aged nine to 11 when the damage is done. At that stage those with a major dysfunctional problem or who are involved in anti-social behaviour are already on the way to Mountjoy Prison. The dormant accounts money and all disbursements should be targeted at the most needy in society and put into pre-school education. I know there are many examples of good practice in this regard and I commend the people who have done this over the years.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that the reconstituted board retain responsibility for preparation of the disbursement plan. It should periodically review and assess the effectiveness of the plan and the extent to which its objectives have been achieved. That is an important section because we must deal with the effectiveness of the plan and the extent to which its objectives have been achieved. There is no point in spending money in particular areas and throwing it at issues if it cannot be accounted for and there is no assurance it is going to the most needy. I commend the people working in disadvantaged areas, particularly in primary schools, on the way they account every June to the Department of Education and Science for the extra, &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 spent on out-of-school activities to look after poor children. They account for every single penny. In comparison, the way some Ministers squander money is an absolute disgrace. On those issues I commend the people who are accountable.</P>
      <P>The Bill also proposes that the reconstituted board should &ldquo;prepare reports on the additionally of the spend&rdquo;. The board shall comprise 11 members with the knowledge or experience relevant to its functions and to be appointed by the Minister. I urge the Minister when making appointments to such boards to take into account that it is important to have the right people who should be committed and have their eyes on the <Col N="59" />ball. As regards the targeting of resources, we should also look at the plight of Travellers in our society. I thank my 18 colleagues from the D&aacute;il and Seanad who last week joined the Oireachtas support group for Travellers&rsquo; interests. Part of our focus will be to ensure that Travellers are brought into the mainstream of society. This is something that must be tackled and dealt with head on. I also encourage my colleagues in local authorities to be brave in some of the decisions they make. There is no excuse nowadays for having children living on the side of the road without toilets or water. The figure is small and if the political will exists, the problem can be tackled. I commend the Members of the Oireachtas who have become involved in this group. I hope all the Ministers in the Cabinet will listen to the different issues that arise in this regard over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>The new section 34 of the principal Act as inserted by section 7 of the Bill provides that the Minister may remove a board member, including the chairperson, if that person &ldquo;has become incapable through ill-health of performing his or her functions or has committed stated misbehaviour, or if the member&rsquo;s removal from office appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance of the Board&rsquo;s functions&rdquo;. This section is very important because one cannot have people on board who are not committed to the issues. Neither can there be anyone on board dealing with the disbursements of such funds who has any type of track record of serious misbehaviour. The new section 34 also provides that &ldquo;A member of the board ceases to be qualified for ... and ... hold office if [he or she] is adjudicated bankrupt, makes ... arrangement with creditors, is ... sentenced to imprisonment, or is disqualified or restricted from being a [company] director ...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The new section 38 of the principal Act as inserted by section 7 of the Bill provides that persons who are nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann or are elected as Members of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or a local authority may not hold office as board members. I welcome that even though I know some people might have reservations about it. I see that as a positive step. It obviates the risk of political influence. It is important to ensure that one has people committed to the ethos of the legislation, whether it is from the viewpoint of educational disadvantage, people with disabilities or services for the most needy. That section provides for matters I believe are important.</P>
      <P>The new section 39 of the principal Act as inserted by section 7 of the Bill provides that the board, subject to ministerial approval, may engage such consultants, advisers or support staff as are necessary for the performance of its functions. I have reservations about that section because I become concerned when I see phrases such as &ldquo;subject to ministerial approval, may engage such consultants, advisers&rdquo; etc. This is a wake up call. A sufficiently bad image has been <Col N="60" />created in this House regarding the spending of money on advisers and consultants. I advise the Minister to be extremely careful with section 39 because he is leaving himself wide open. He must ensure there is accountability, effectiveness, leadership and people committed to the area.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Bill provides for the chairperson of the former board to remain accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of disbursements by that board. This is an important section, dealing with the Committee of Public Accounts. As well as being accountable to the Cabinet, it is vital the board is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in which we can scrutinise, cross-examine and deal with the issues raised. We can also challenge and question the spending of the money. Again, the priority must be the poorest children and the most needy in society. We must also be creative, in dealing with issues such as poverty, disadvantage and housing. As for people&rsquo;s rights and civil liberties, there was an interesting debate yesterday in the House. We should seriously examine the idea of adopting a rights-based approach when dealing with issues such as poverty, educational disadvantage, disabilities and related issues. The reality is that we have a very prosperous and wealthy country with unemployment at a low level. However, there is a small core section of society at which resources and services could be targeted. The public, as citizens and taxpayers, will recognise the wisdom of such an approach and it would be a major boost for our society.</P>
      <P>There are some very positive elements in this legislation. I have criticised certain parts as well. Overall, I believe the Bill could be tougher, tighter and somewhat more democratic. I urge the Minister and the Cabinet to target the money available at the people who need it most.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am delighted to make a contribution to the debate on this Bill. I compliment my good friend, Deputy Finian McGrath, on his reasonable approach. Perhaps he should print his speech and give it to his colleagues on the Opposition side who might read it with some interest.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, is present, because I am always happy to congratulate him on the work he is doing. Representing the constituency of Dublin South-West, I am aware of his efforts, particularly in housing and programmes counteracting drug difficulties. He has been especially supportive of the Tallaght community in that regard and I am happy to acknowledge this and to wish him well.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution set the tone for this debate in which he pointed out that the Government has continued the good work of previous Administrations in introducing various <Col N="61" />programmes and measures to tackle disadvantage and exclusion in our society. He went on to say the dormant accounts scheme was one such measure and made the point that everybody in the House welcomed the introduction of the original legislation which established a framework for the use of unclaimed moneys in financial institutions to assist the less well-off in society. That sums it up and that is what we are about.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by some of remarks made by colleagues about dormant accounts. I was of the view that the scheme was being welcomed by community groups that wished to make a difference and which sought moneys for that purpose. On the point about political interference, again I was struck by the manner in which the disbursements were made and announced which was in stark contrast to old-style behaviour, if that is what people are complaining about. The manner in which the fund is being administered is quite healthy in that regard. Other Members made the point about the great work that is achievable with moneys from this source. Like my colleagues, I have watched with interest the various disbursements in my constituency. In the Tallaght area in particular a number of organisations have warmly welcomed, as I do, the different announcements. For example, the Tallaght Centre for the Unemployed was particularly pleased to get a grant for its community bus.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I have watched with interest the various disbursements in my constituency. In the Tallaght area in particular, a number of organisations have warmly welcomed, as I do, the different announcements. For example, the Tallaght Centre for the Unemployed, in the village, was especially pleased to get a grant for its community bus. It was warmly welcomed by the wider commmunity. Similarly, the work of the Tallaght volunteer bureau has been greatly assisted by the dormant accounts funds, as well as by other Government funding. This group provides a tremendous service in the Tallaght region and is operating from a full-time office in Tallaght village.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Curran, and I made a case to the Dublin community games organisation to do something positive in our major population centres for the development of sports in the area. We were delighted that the dormant accounts board recently disbursed &euro;80,000 to the Dublin community games organisation so that it could set up a system in Tallaght and Clondalkin and employ a full-time development officer for the next 18 months. It is very important that we support such development.</P>
      <P>Many of us bring our experiences to our work in the D&aacute;il. I have no difficulty in remembering that I came from a community background. I was not born a politician and because I did not have a pretty face I had to go about my work in a different manner. I brought my experiences in Tallaght and Crumlin to my politics. I was full-time press officer for the National Youth Federation and I spent ten years as national press <Col N="62" />officer for the community games. That background assists my work in helping the various community groups with which I deal. I know I have mentioned Tallaght the odd time, but I also represent Brittas, Templeogue, Greenhills and Firhouse. There is a tremendous community spirit in those areas. In the greater Tallaght region, there are many organisations which I am happy to support. It is getting even more difficult nowadays to get volunteers as the economy is doing well and people are at work. There is less time for people to give to community endeavour. We have to stress that volunteerism is very important, whether it is in Waterford, Cork, the north inner city or Tallaght.</P>
      <P>There are still pockets in many communities where the little boats still need assistance in a situation where all boats are rising. There are many communities in my constituency where we need to make that point. In doing that work, I have followed the example of my colleague, former Deputy Chris Flood, whom I succeeded and who spent 15 years in the D&aacute;il until 2002 and was Minister with responsibility for local development. He always took the view that we need to support the policy of social inclusion. I am glad I have made my own efforts in that regard. I can speak of the estates of west Tallaght, such as Killinarden, Brookfield, Jobstown and Fettercairn in my own parish. Other communities include Avonbeg, Bolbrooke, Avonmore, St. Dominic&rsquo;s and Homelawn in the Tymon north area. As part of my work with colleagues in the D&aacute;il and in the local authority, we continue to stress the need to assist these communities.</P>
      <P>The dormant accounts fund provides an opportunity to do that. They provide us with the means and the funding to make a difference. We must seek out those disadvantaged communities and ensure that the money goes to those projects that make a difference. When everything is perfect, the Government and agencies might look at it in a different way. I am of the view that we should discriminate against those disadvantaged communities which need help lifting their boats.</P>
      <P>We are now beginning to make a difference in my constituency and to provide those facilities to which the people are entitled. At the beginning of my political career on Dublin City Council in 1991, I was very critical of Dublin Corporation. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, loves Dublin Corporation so he will not want me to say too much. I made the point that there were absentee landlords who had built 5,000 houses in Tallaght. No one in City Hall gave a damn and those of us who campaigned made the point that they had to be accountable. We should not just build houses and forget about the need for facilities and services. We have made much progress in that regard.</P>
      <P>Since the Square opened in Tallaght in 1990, there has been much progress. People in disadvantaged communities have been able to take account of all the facilities that have been built. Tallaght is now a very vibrant community. <Col N="63" />It still has its problems like anywhere else, but we are making progress. Disbursements from Government have to continue, particularly from the dormant accounts fund.</P>
      <P>Some colleagues have been critical of this Bill and that is fine in a democracy, but we should be careful how we deal with these issues. I see no point in throwing out the baby with the bath water where there are difficulties. In every legislation, even Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers have queries and concerns. I have never been afraid to make those points while I have been here. Having read this legislation, I believe that the Minister is on the right track. If it is a question of dotting the odd &ldquo;i&rdquo; and crossing the odd &ldquo;t&rdquo;. I know the Minister is amenable to suggestions and will always be happy to consult.</P>
      <P>I get a sense that community groups throughout the country will have suggestions to make, and I am particularly interested in those in Dublin South-West which will have points of view to express on this legislation. I hope that the Department will still be open to receiving those suggestions. Despite what we have heard in this debate so far, I suspect that many groups will claim that the Government is going in the right direction. This is all about providing facilities and services in circumstances where they might not otherwise be provided.</P>
      <P>It was also the intention with regard to lottery funding. Over the years &ldquo;lottery funding&rdquo; was an abused term and I often heard people, as I heard them again today, talking about slush funds and so forth. It is a fact, however, that good use has been made of those funds through successive Administrations. It is important to acknowledge that and not go overboard on the matter.</P>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning and I have listened to this debate in the House. It appears that my Opposition colleagues have suddenly become paranoid about the next general election. I reminded some of them this morning that, according to my calculations, there are at least 800 before it is due to be held. I do not know where the paranoia originates. It is rather early for the Opposition to get into a panic about it.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that the Government is working on delivering its programme. With regard to the legislation being introduced, it is a case of business as usual. While I am the last to lecture my colleagues, although sometimes one is tempted, I believe we should calm down, conduct our business, deliver our programme and conduct reasonable debates. I will always engage in them. However, we should do our job and ensure that the legislation we pass is good for our communities. As my colleague, Senator Ormonde, says, we must give the people what they want. That principle should govern all Members.</P>
      <P>The Bill regulates the disbursement of massive amounts of public money which has been left in dormant accounts. The Minister is right to put the <Col N="64" />current <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement on a statutory basis. Despite the political points which must be made, I hope Members accept that. The Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs and all other Ministers who have responsibility under this legislation must ensure that money is allocated in a proper fashion. They will ultimately be responsible to the Oireachtas while those holding temporary positions on the board will have no such responsibility.</P>
      <P>The proposal to ensure that existing structures are used is sensible. There have been too many situations where substantial amounts of money provided for the establishment of new organisations and jobs have been spent on administration. The Bill will ensure that the cost of distribution will be kept to a minimum with the maximum amount of money being given to those in need of it. When one considers the effect of the fund on the various schemes, it is clear that areas of particular disadvantage have benefited greatly, as they should. The schemes have been administered by the Department, not independent boards or specially commissioned quangos.</P>
      <P>Communities have benefited, particularly those in areas designated for the RAPID programme. There are RAPID programmes in Killinarden, Fettercairn and Jobstown in Tallaght and in nearby Clondalkin. It is right that those communities would continue to benefit from these funds. We could spend substantial amounts of money administering these schemes but we would then have to explain to the people who are seeking a playground so their children will not have to play on busy roads that the money was spent on administration. The thrust of this legislation is concerned with the need for the Government to take responsibility for implementing the approaches for which it was elected.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to communities in the Tallaght area but I am aware that the Bill is considered equally important for every community throughout the country. I wish the groups throughout the country who are seeking to benefit from the dormant accounts well. When I was preparing this contribution I was tempted to list the organisations in Tallaght who have submitted applications and are waiting patiently by their phones for news about disbursements. However, I decided not to do so and put pressure on the groups concerned. We must continue to ensure that the organisations who need the funds and who have the will and the means to implement their programmes will continue to be funded. As with all grant schemes, it should not be about topping up or administration but about providing services and facilities in environments where they might not otherwise be provided.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well and I support the legislation. He has listened to the Members&rsquo; contributions and I am confident that where genuine points have been raised on which he could be flexible, he will consider them. It is important, however, that we press forward. I have <Col N="65" />no problem with party political debates but this legislation is necessary. It will be welcomed, particularly by the groups that will benefit from it. The Minister of State should do his utmost to facilitate as many people as possible and implement the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen such bad legislation since I first became a Member of the Seanad seven years ago. It is simply a grab for money from people&rsquo;s pockets. There is a special type of money in the dormant account funds. It comes from the accounts of people who have died and have not used their money. It also comes from insurance policies which remain dormant because the person who would have been entitled to the money has passed on. The money does not come from taxation but from the pockets of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>It is a great deal of money. A total of &euro;60 million will be disbursed this year. The Minister showed such confidence in the existing board that he doubled its allocation from &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million. It is right and proper that the Government should decide on a policy issue with regard to what areas of the community should benefit most. It is also right and proper that the Government would indicate that it wants a significant percentage to be spent in RAPID areas, which is most welcome, and on various types of disadvantage. The Government has clear and unambiguous access to policy decisions of the board. It dictates the principles on which the money is disbursed, which is only correct.</P>
      <P>It is also correct that ADM Limited assess the applications made by the public. Its assessments go before the board and the board issues a press release, e-mail or fax about its disbursements. I have received an e-mail whenever the board makes its disbursements. The e-mail lists each organisation that benefits and under which category it is allocated the money. There is transparency in how the money is disbursed. There is also transparency about Government policy directing how the money should be disbursed. There is satisfaction in the community with this, particularly the communities that get the funds.</P>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor spoke about communities in Tallaght waiting by the phone for a call about whether they got the grant. From whom do they await a call? Is it from Deputy O&rsquo;Connor or from the dormant accounts board? The board disburses the money, clearly, transparently and openly. There should be no hanging around waiting for phone calls and no writing of letters or whatever people will indulge in after this Bill is passed. We should have a 21st century political system. There should be complete transparency and openness.</P>
      <P>The fundamental change in this process is that the Minister and the Government have taken on themselves the power to finally decide to whom this money goes. That is wrong. It is, at the least, open to being perceived as a slush fund. The first person to refer to a slush fund in the context of <Col N="66" />the dormant accounts fund was our European Commissioner and former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy. He said from the place in which the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is sitting that to avoid any consideration that this was a slush fund, he was establishing the Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board. The Minister of State is now introducing legislation to make it a slush fund.</P>
      <P>The communities which receive money from the fund are generally disadvantaged and need support. They are crying out for funding due to inadequate Government provisions. They need the money and support now and are happy with the system as it stands. Not one community of which I am aware has registered a complaint with the Department or board on disbursement procedures. The agenda is being set by the Minister of State and his associates and it is absolutely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I submitted a freedom of information request some months ago while I was still working in this area, which revealed no conflict, dissatisfaction, complaints or concerns about the transparency, openness and capacity of the organisation carrying out the work in question. There is no evidence in the Department&rsquo;s records of letters or e-mails demonstrating serious adverse comments on the manner in which the board has been doing its job. While the number of people on the board and the time they require to carry out their duties fully and satisfactorily are issues, there has never been a complaint or demand that their functions should be devolved to the political parties in power.</P>
      <P>I saw no letter on behalf of a disadvantaged community asking the Government to communicate through its local Fianna F&aacute;il or Progressive Democrats Deputy or Senator. No letter was written stating that a reply was awaited from a particular politician or asking that a Deputy or Senator call to a person&rsquo;s house to say whether money would be provided from the fund. Ministers, Ministers of State and Government Deputies and Senators will now trapeze around constituencies delivering cheques to the disadvantaged or disability groups with the greatest need for the money and the least need for a patronising approach by the Government.</P>
      <P>In the 21st century politics change day by day. The people are not fools and will not be codded anymore by the Government&rsquo;s carry-on. They know what the Government is up to and will not wear it. When I open the newspapers to see Deputy X pirouette on the football field or Senator Y seeking publicity, I will say &ldquo;Shame on the Minister of State and the Government for this despicable act&rdquo;. This is not the Government&rsquo;s money. It belongs to ordinary people and should be disbursed according to the proper, efficient, effective and transparent mechanisms which currently operate.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister of State has the gall to sit in the House and push through this legislation. The Government has reached its low<Col N="67" />est ebb. While we will protest in the strongest possible way and make our points firmly to the Government, we know it has the votes to pass this Bill. The people will not forgive the Government. Moneys from the national lottery&rsquo;s sports fund were disbursed politically. According to information obtained under freedom of information procedures, the list of clubs to receive money in a certain county was rearranged to ensure that those closest to the Minister received the largest sums. I remember looking at the list and money was granted to clubs for buildings which were never even constructed. Such activities must stop now. The voluntary community is a pillar of our society and is entitled to be free of political patronage and the intent of the provisions of the Bill. There was no argument in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to support the Government&rsquo;s actions other than raw political expediency. I very much regret that the Government has sunk so desperately low.</P>
      <P>It is not just the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who are to blame. While responsibility for dormant accounts currently rests within their Department and specifically with the Minister of State, the Minister is losing his power in this area at the Cabinet table. Under the new system, all Ministers sitting around the Cabinet table will set out their targets and make gains for their local areas. Disbursements will be decided politically, which is wrong. There is no argument to support this approach. The Minister of State spoke about transparency, but it will only exist after the event. We will not see transparency until three months after the election is over when we will be told everything has been audited. While the cheques will have been delivered, hopefully the votes will not have been counted in the Government&rsquo;s favour. Ministers will decide in Cabinet with marginal constituencies should be provided with money to secure seats. The Government will attempt to ensure that certain communities have their needs satisfied by bringing them to the top of the list while forgetting about people with equal if not greater needs.</P>
      <P>There is no better or fairer system than the current one to assess equality of need and measure applications objectively and transparently. I urge the Minister of State to change his mind even on this Stage and to have the humility to withdraw his Bill. That is what the public will insist on. We will tell people on the doorsteps in the by-election campaign in Meath and Kildare of the Government plans as they must know exactly what it is up to, and the Government will receive its answer there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to make a brief contribution on this Bill as the Chairman of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I find it fascinating that a fellow politician would insinuate or make the accusation that politicians cannot be <Col N="68" />impartial. From what has been said, it appears that all politicians are incapable of being fair. I refute those remarks and do not wish to be associated with them. They are very unfair. It is a very sad day for politics if we are to spend a considerable amount of time undermining each other and the concept that we can be impartial and fair in presenting the case for our constituents. It is sad to imply that Ministers cannot consider assessments and sign off on what has been agreed by a body without some ulterior motive.</P>
      <P>Prior to the launch a week ago of a report on volunteerism in Ireland, the committee which I chair spent a great deal of time listening to voluntary agencies. We found that one of the major problems they faced in the context of funding involved the multiplicity of people both within and outside Departments to whom application for funding must be made. Applications were required to be assessed by a significant number of groups, organisations and State bodies. One of our key findings was that <i>ad hoc</i>, multi-agency funding makes it difficult for organisations to plan ahead. We recommended that all funding for voluntary organisations and volunteering should be channelled exclusively through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to improve efficiency and transparency. Funding commitments should be entered into over a number of years which would greatly facilitate the monitoring of State expenditure. We agreed on this report which issued more than a week ago. The streamlining of the administration of funds was debated and we went on the presentations made by various groups. I am, therefore, surprised the Opposition spokespersons did not allude to this. However, this issue can be debated on Committee Stage. It has not come out of the woodwork without warning. Our committee spent months examining the issues facing voluntary groups and individuals who seek funding.</P>
      <P>While I reject the accusation that politicians are untrustworthy, we give away many powers to ensure we have nothing to do with taking decisions and, therefore, the people given the powers are more accountable to the House than its Members. However, the public can only get rid of Members and not the individuals to whom such powers have been delegated. We are Members for the duration of a D&aacute;il, however long that may be, and we are not on three or five-year contracts. We were lucky the previous D&aacute;il lasted five years but on many occasions the D&aacute;il has dissolved more quickly than that. The system is wrong and, as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd stated, this will be pointed out by the public during the upcoming by-election campaigns. If we make decisions, we should be accountable for them, particularly when we go to the electorate.</P>
      <P>I agree that the amount of the fund is important. Many agencies do good work and they fund essential projects. I was asked to comment at the conclusion of the PEACE II programme about the development of a PEACE III programme. I replied that the opening of a new prem<Col N="69" />ises is always a grand occasion but often a few years down the line I am contacted by the people running it to say they have nobody to manage it. Volunteers are not available because they have become fed up or they cannot manage the workload. When a significant sum of money is involved, it is important that a strategic, sustainable approach is adopted regarding its disbursement.</P>
      <P>People should examine what happened under the PEACE I and II programmes by visiting the old projects and asking those running them how they are getting on and what are their needs. New projects are continually invented. People are excited about them and a great deal of effort goes into them but the planning and development of such projects is an issue. I was contacted earlier by two different groups who have beautiful facilities but who do not have somebody to manage them and do not know where to obtain funding for such posts. If this fund allocated moneys to pay personnel for a year, does that give people false hope and string them along for another year?</P>
      <P>A strategic approach for the next ten years should be adopted whereby groups are not tied over until the next round of funding because there will be a time funding will not be available from as many agencies. As Deputy McGinley will acknowledge, Border counties can access sources of funding that many other counties cannot. Once off decisions are okay and we have a day out when projects are launched. I could list many worthwhile projects in my area but we must be seen to spend money strategically to ensure each project is sustainable and not funded in the interest of short-term political security and glory, as was alluded to by Opposition Members. We are looking for the day out the with cup of tea and a sandwich. We are members of communities and we will still have to go before those communities for election. There should be long-term planning for projects which we celebrate and laud when funding is sanctioned.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGinley referred to pet projects. Under the national lottery and sports capital programmes, the Minister has emphasised the transparency of the application process. All applications are subject to the freedom of information process and groups can establish where their applications failed. It is disingenuous to make the accusation that every application is subject to a political lottery. I am slightly taken aback that Deputy McGinley is upset that Donegal received significant funding under the national lottery programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal has deserved significant funding under this programme. All the applications fulfilled the necessary criteria and thus received funding. Even following the resignation of Deputy McDaid as a Minister of State, <Col N="70" />significant funding was allocated to County Donegal and I am confident that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy McGinley is concerned about pet projects, perhaps he should highlight projects that should not have obtained funding in the past. Every project I have visited deserved funding and they should receive multiples of their current funding.</P>
      <P>It is not popular to criticise funding agencies and to quiz their decisions or approaches to applications. However, I am concerned about continuity and the strategic approach to projects in terms of what happens in five or ten years rather than in 18 months. If every Member debated the funding issue rather than playing politics with it, they would agree funding agencies overlap and a number of projects fall between two stools. These issues must be addressed by the new board, the Government and whoever will progress the board&rsquo;s programme. Communities identify what they want, contact a funding agency and sometimes they get what they want while on other occasions a feasibility study is granted. The money is then spent on a report outlining what the communities know anyway and, therefore, the report adds to information that is known as opposed to recommending solutions. This is similar to not awarding grants to students who pursue a second degree course or a lesser qualification. It may not happen in all cases, but it does happen. I know of cases where people have cried halt because although there are many reports the money is not available for the projects on which they want money spent. There is an overlap in some funding and falling between stools in terms of other levels of funding.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to mention those who come out of the woodwork to volunteer to present and put together the applications for community ventures. The voluntary effort in all our communities is significant. We spent months considering the work of volunteers before putting together the report. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is here and that we will have an opportunity before Committee Stage to consider the issues of volunteering and volunteers. Our report made straightforward recommendations to keep the volunteers we have, to encourage other volunteers and to send out the good message that not only does volunteering help the community but there is also an added bonus for the volunteer.</P>
      <P>In that context, I often meet people who have gone through the process of trying to get an application from A to Z to get their project up and running. Some of these people are weary. Perhaps two or three of those seeking funds for projects have different impressions of what they want in the end and a tussle develops between what one or the other funded. The people caught in the middle are the volunteers. They are not pro<Col N="71" />fessional funding people but ordinary people who have given up their time to try to do something for their community.</P>
      <P>Streamlined funding application processes mean those applying for funds must have the ability to make the application and get the project done. There are a number of very frustrated people who have put much time into projects, but have got caught on petty details. There can be petty jealousies within their community and petty problems between the multiple funding agencies. These are issues which can stand in the way of volunteers. Some people have come to me about particular projects and said that if they knew at the start what it was going to be like, they would never have started. However, I know that when there is a conclusion, when the door opens and the project gets up and running, they get over their worst feelings.</P>
      <P>One thing about the Bill that I would change is the proposal that all the members of the board must have knowledge or experience of matters relevant to the board&rsquo;s functions. In as much as we try so hard to keep politicians away from decision making and decision taking, we try to ensure that these boards are made up of people who on paper are incredibly intellectual and knowledgeable. This may not be a fair representation of what is meant in this Bill. However, I know from speaking to ordinary people on the ground that they think it would be much more useful to have the normal person on the board who has tried to get a grant, to have someone with that experience on it.</P>
      <P>The Opposition often feels it must challenge the appointments made to boards, no matter if they have been selected from <i>Who&rsquo;s Who,</i> because it feels the Minister might know the person. Often, a person who has no qualifications on paper but who has on-the-ground experience of trying to do the type of work for which the board is responsible has as much to offer. Therefore, I wonder whether it is necessary that all board members should be whizz kids or expert in the dormant accounts area.</P>
      <P>Form filling is another issue that causes a difficulty for individual projects. We have had the PNR in our area and I could list the wonderful projects that have been developed under that.</P>
      <P>As Mr. Willie McCarter retires this month as chairman of the International Fund for Ireland, I acknowledge the solid projects to which that fund contributed, for example, a car ferry across the Foyle that carried 700,000 passengers in the first two years of its existence. This project came about as a result of the agreement by Mr. Charlie McCreevy to release European funds, supported by the International Fund for Ireland. That is a sustainable project. It has brought the two sides of the Foyle together, new tourism interests and reconciliation on all levels because people go to shop on both sides of the Border. This is the type of project people like to see because they know <Col N="72" />it will still be there in ten, 12 or 15 years&rsquo; time and will have fulfilled an important need.</P>
      <P>We must look at the bigger picture. In the week that is in it I would like to acknowledge the huge job done by Mr. Willie McCarter. Some people might say that he lives in Inishowen and that much of the money probably went there because of that. That is not true because he was totally impartial. However, that accusation would not be made as fast as if he was a Minister from Inishowen with responsibility for the disbursement of dormant accounts funds.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the 420 projects and the &euro;42 million already spent, my area of Inishowen has a population of 30,000, the same size population as Counties Leitrim or Louth, and covers a broad area, yet only small parts of the area got into the CL&Aacute;R programme on the second evaluation of that programme. Much of Inishowen is not in the CL&Aacute;R area, yet in overall terms it has suffered one of the greatest declines in the textile industry in the country and, therefore, significant job losses. However, the area covered by CL&Aacute;R is small, it does not have a RAPID programme and it is not in a drugs task force area.</P>
      <P>Location should be a consideration. I know there are criteria in terms of social and economic disadvantage and in terms of disability. We have many projects relating to disability and I hope the disability aspect of the funds will not be placed third or fourth in comparison to that of the task force or the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID area status. Many of the projects waiting for funding, including many in my constituency, are not under consideration currently on the basis that they have not prioritised under the criteria set down. However, I believe they are as eligible as many of the areas in central Dublin or elsewhere that are so designated.</P>
      <P>Retrospection should be an element of this Bill. We should look at projects post-funding to see how they have done. I think an element of this is provided for in the Bill. There should be a facility for the newly constituted board to look back after funding has been granted. This is one of the issues put forward by the Opposition which is concerned that projects will be chosen politically, which I refute. At least, there must be retrospection in terms of checking years later to see how the money was spent, whether it was well spent and whether further funding is needed.</P>
      <P>It may not be popular to say this, but a few projects well carried out is better than a plethora of unsustainable projects. It is better to have a strategic approach so that we can stand over the fact that the projects will be there into the future. We have some examples of this, but we also have examples of projects where people have been left high and dry after getting the good news story and a good day&rsquo;s celebration with the tea, red ribbon and scissors. Sporting organisations and many others know what it is like to have a wonderful facility with nobody to run it.</P>
      <P>This issue should be central to this Bill. We must have a system where we can challenge on <Col N="73" />the floor of the House, or through the Votes of the Ministers in the Estimates each year. I expect to see much more of this Bill before we finish and hope the Minister will be open to the tweaking of issues that genuinely need tweaking. I look forward to working with him and bringing the Bill through Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to remember every letter he receives from Deputies. I will remind him of a letter I sent him early last year concerning the allocation of money from the dormant accounts fund. I made the suggestion that serious consideration should be given to the notion that the money would be used for the provision of radiotherapy services in the south east. The Minister of State was kind enough to acknowledge the letter and respond to it. He made it clear that the current tranche of funding had been allocated but stated that it could be considered once further legislation had been passed. He also explained the advertising process and other aspects of the system.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister of State is aware that the T&aacute;naiste met the Cancer Care Alliance two or three days ago. It was the opinion of those who met her, and of other people, that the perspective on this matter has changed. Previously the provision of radiotherapy in regional treatment centres was not looked upon favourably in Government circles but the T&aacute;naiste appears to take a different view. An application should be made for funding for radiotherapy services, especially in view of the apparent shift which has taken place. This is an opportunity to deal with this matter. Speculation on the amount of money required varies. Some people say a linear accelerator would cost between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million while others say it would cost &euro;10 million. Whatever the cost, it is time to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting it was reported that departmental officials had expressed concern as to where funding would be found. The dormant accounts fund would be a perfect way to solve the problem once and for all.</P>
      <P>At the meeting it was made clear by the T&aacute;naiste that she would prefer a public private partnership. A couple of private entities have put together plans for the building of a radiotherapy centre in a private facility in Waterford. We have not had a definitive answer from Government as to whether it would pay for public patients who are catered for in a private facility but whatever we end up with, this is the perfect solution to the problem of financing the project.</P>
      <P>In his reply to my letter the Minister of State referred to the purpose of the fund being to benefit those affected by economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and people with disabilities. In this case we are talking about people who are dying because they have to travel long distances. I assume Deputy O&rsquo;Shea has had a similar experience of people coming into his office who are dying because of the journey they <Col N="74" />have to make from Waterford to Dublin for radiotherapy. Doctors will confirm that travelling, be it in a taxi or minibus, is killing these people.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to criticism about transparency in the allocation of funding. I am not interested in that. I am not bothered about who makes the decision but this issue must be on the Minister&rsquo;s radar screen. This is a good suggestion of how to deal with the funding aspect of this problem once and for all.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is not from Waterford but he understands the political issues that exist in Waterford and the south east when it comes to radiotherapy. It is time the Government parties dealt with this matter. There is no need to remind him that Fianna F&aacute;il has only one councillor out of 15 on the city council. The provision of radiotherapy services impacted on the local elections. He does not need a lecture from me about local politics but I remind him that this matter is worth dealing with and I believe this is the way to do it. I would welcome a guarantee that funding would at least come from some source.</P>
      <P>I have been criticised for not saying a great deal about radiotherapy. I have tried not to politicise this issue. However, when I say something I usually end up being criticised for what I say. If the result of this legislation is that Ministers would have more input in the process then I suggest that the Minister of State would take this on board and speak to officials in the Department of Health and Children. Funding must come from somewhere. One cannot just pluck it out of the air. I do not know if the estimate of in excess of &euro;500 million is overblown in terms of unclaimed life assurance policies. If that is the case, these services could easily be provided within the remit of this funding.</P>
      <P>I have been a Deputy for two and a half years and was a county councillor. We are anxious to deal with this issue. The next election is probably two years away. Now that the T&aacute;naiste has changed the complexion of things in recent days it is time we dealt with the matter. I am tired of dealing with people who are dying and who have to travel to Dublin. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the centralisation of Government funds. If money were disbursed regionally this matter would have been dealt with in the region by now. Radiotherapy services are badly needed. Almost every other area of cancer care and treatment already exists in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>I will say no more as I am sure the Minister of State has got the point. I appreciate his reply to me and his explanation of the process as far as funding is concerned. We will ensure an application is made. I am not clear on how these decisions are made in Government circles. Some people say one thing while others say something else. I plead with the Minister of State to say whatever he can in response, although I do not expect him to be able to give a definitive answer. <Col N="75" />Perhaps somebody could speak to the T&aacute;naiste or somebody else in the Department of Health and Children to sort this out between now and when the legislation is passed and applications are received. We are not talking about a great deal of money. The service is urgently needed. It is high time this matter was dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s position on dormant accounts. It was a good idea that this money would not be left lying in banks but that it would be distributed to people affected by economic, social and educational disadvantage and people with disabilities. I am glad the banks did not get their hands on this money which was not rightfully theirs. Banks have enough money.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Ministers involved in bringing the Bill to the House. I have worked with the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and I know he is a man of social conscience. He is fully committed to helping people who are disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is right and proper that the disbursement of these funds is advertised so that everybody can be aware of them. Some people were unaware until recently that money could be obtained from the dormant accounts fund. This debate will highlight the fact that money is available from the dormant accounts fund. I also welcome the fact that each application will be processed and detailed and that the groups seeking funding will have an opportunity to put forward their case.</P>
      <P>I also welcome politicians&rsquo; political input into making representations on behalf of various bodies in their localities. As I travel the country, I find there is no one as aware or as knowledgeable as the local and national politicians in their own areas. I do not see how anyone could doubt or question the huge commitment which politicians make to the people and their areas, regardless of to which political party they belong. People are getting a good service from their politicians. Most of them work non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are committed to their job, enjoy it and are good at it. Moreover, they have the faith of the people.</P>
      <P>It is up to politicians of all political persuasions and parties to promote the dormant account fund so that money goes to the most disadvantaged people in their areas. The people of Longford-Roscommon have been slightly disappointed that more funding did not flow into the constituency from the dormant accounts fund given that Longford town is in a RAPID area. If we formulate policies to map the best way forward, they should be implemented. We should not have discussions and come up with papers and ideas if they are not pursued. It is important that when the people elect a Government on its policies, it should implement those in its programme for Government as mandated by the people. This would give the Government a chance to take responsibility for implementing strategies concerning that <Col N="76" />which it was elected to do. This is precisely what this Bill proposes.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by the colossal amount of money which people have left lying in dormant accounts. Nonetheless, I welcome that the money will be spent properly and appropriately and will benefit people. In that respect, perhaps it is not a good idea to tell people not to retain dormant accounts. However, it is sad that people have placed money in accounts and left it there while they, their families or friends could have benefited from it when they were alive. Perhaps people should not hoard money so that, when they pass away, the money is of no advantage when they could instead have obtained some joy, pleasure or fun from it in their lifetime.</P>
      <P>I welcome this good debate on the Bill because it highlights the fact that the fund exists at a national level. I compliment the members of the board and the other people involved with it on the work they have done. It is also critical that the board is being conferred with a new power to report on the additionality of disbursements. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, on his work on behalf of the country and the underprivileged. Long may he continue his work.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to contribute to the debate on this Bill and I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing it before the House. As a former bank official in the dim and distant past, it was always a source of some considerable curiosity to me to see the amount of money in any single bank branch which was classified as dormant. For many years before the original Dormant Accounts Act came into being, serious questions had to be answered by the financial institutions about the system of classifying accounts as dormant. Sometimes these accounts arose in an innocent and genuine manner but there were other occasions on which the genesis of the accounts might not have been clad in such lily-white clothing.</P>
      <P>The concept behind the original Dormant Accounts Bill and this one is very solid. The disbursement of moneys towards the less well-off sections of society is entirely apt and appropriate. When one considers the amount of money involved at present &mdash; something of the order of &euro;200 million &mdash; it brings the issue home to anyone with an interest the level of imbalance that sometimes exists between the better-off and the less well-off.</P>
      <P>It must also be stated that it is not always the better-off whose accounts are dormant. In many cases, dormant accounts arise from a genuine oversight on the part of ordinary decent people who either forget themselves or forget to inform their families what they have. I was not paying a great deal of attention to the debate on my monitor but I heard my colleague, the Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy <Col N="77" />Keaveney, refer to certain statements which were made by Opposition Deputies suggesting that there may be something inappropriate about the manner in which these funds are disbursed. Such a suggestion in not only fundamentally wrong and inappropriate, it does no service to the profession of politics, ourselves as politicians, our democracy or those who make such statements. While I am a relative newcomer to politics, professional politicians have been only too quick to do down an opponent for petty political advantage. We often overlook the duty that we all have to our profession and its importance to the institution of democracy.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education was established in December 2003 as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. The council has 12 members, all with a special interest in or knowledge of the area of education of children with disabilities. There have been 71 special educational needs organisers employed by the council since September 2004. They are deployed on a nationwide basis, with at least one special educational needs organiser deployed in each county.</P>
        <P>Each special educational needs organiser is responsible for the primary and second level schools in their area and have made contact with each of their schools and informed them of their role. A recruitment process for a further nine special educational needs organisers has been commenced by the council to bring its total up to 80 persons nationwide. In addition to the organisers, there are 17 staff employed at the head offices of the council in Trim, County Meath.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, will process the relevant appli<Col N="78" />cation for resources and inform the school of the outcome.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the council will greatly enhance the provision of services for children with special educational needs, resulting in a timely response to schools which have made application for special educational needs supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council&rsquo;s operation, through the special educational needs organisers, will provide a focal point of contact for parents, guardians and schools and will result in a much improved service for all.</P>
        <P>My Department is reviewing the proposed new system of teacher allocation to primary schools to cater for pupils with high incidence special educational needs. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting representative interests. A letter was recently issued to the council inviting it to submit its views on the general allocation model.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>The weighted system that the Minister claims she is reviewing was not to come into operation until September 2005. However, I have the impression that it is already partly in operation. Teachers, principals and parents inform me that children with special needs are being refused services on the grounds that the school is, for example, an all-girls&rsquo; one with fewer resources. There appears to be much confusion in this area.</P>
        <P>If a child is refused resources under either the weighted system or the existing one, what recourse does the child or his or her parents have to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the National Council for Special Education? While the proposed weighted system will deal with mild disabilities, the Act has no specifications on mild or more severe educational disabilities. Children with milder disabilities are being refused resources under the so-called weighted system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The circular was issued last summer and will come into effect in September 2005. It was never the intention that the weighted system <i>per se</i> would be implemented prior to that date. In the interim, any applications received have been decided on the basis of needs. The idea behind the weighted system is that the staff member will be already assigned to a school or schools to pick up these needs without the need for individual applications. However, it is still not being implemented. In October, I announced a review of it on the basis that small, rural and disadvantaged schools would most likely lose out through the system.</P>
        <P>The idea behind the system is to ensure the needs of the children with more serious learning difficulties continue to be met. They of course will still be able to go through their individual applications and their needs will be met for whatever number of hours on an individual basis. The new system will ensure that the needs of children <Col N="79" />with mild learning difficulties will be picked up in the school. These can be identified by the school, the parents and now the added expertise of the special educational needs organisers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>Many children whose needs have not changed and who previously had a service have been refused resources in recent months. The assumption made is that the schools were operating on a different policy. I have come across a number of cases where it was the principal rather than the psychologist or the Department who informed the parents that their child did not come under the system. This confusion needs to be cleared up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>Services are provided on the basis of the psychological report and the identified needs of the child. If it has been identified that the child does not need the service then he or she will not receive it. The main idea is to have someone in place for all students with high incidence of special educational needs, approximately 10% of the school population. Having heard the views of the council and other partners, I intend to have a system in place in September.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that hundreds of schools throughout the country will lose resources which were allocated to their students as a result of psychological assessments if the proposed weighted system as outlined by circular SP ED 09/04 is implemented; if no child will lose resource support already granted; the way in which she proposes to amend the proposed weighted system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The proposal involves a general allocation to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading or mathematics. This approach to allocating resources for special educational needs is in line with thinking in many European states. An additional 350 teacher posts will be provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. Individual applications may continue to be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Difficulties may have arisen with the allocation under the proposed model for children in small and rural schools if it were implemented as proposed. Accordingly, last October I announced a review of the proposed model to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, <Col N="80" />while ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of services continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. The review involves consultation with representative interests and the National Council for Special Education. It is intended to implement it in the next school year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
        <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister agree that while the new system is administratively easy, it is unfair, as proved in a series of reports? These reports include the study carried out by the national educational psychological service in the Dundalk and Leitrim areas that showed the wide divergence of needs varying from a school that might not need resource teachers to one that might need over 50%. However, all schools will operate under a quota system. Will the Minister do a much more thorough review of rural and small schools? Disadvantaged schools will particularly suffer under the new system.</P>
        <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question on 26 January 2005, the Minister stated that students would continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. Will they continue to receive a service equivalent to a 11:1 pupil-teacher ratio in a special school, which is 2.5 hours individual resource teaching in a mainstream school? Is the Minister aware that over 1,000 schools will lose resources which, by way of psychological assessments of pupils, it has been proven they need, while other schools will gain?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I ordered the review because I was conscious that many schools would lose out, particularly disadvantaged, small and rural schools, which I would not like to see happen. The basic principle is that it is a good idea to have the teaching staff in place in the school rather than children having to wait to have their psychological assessment review carried out or to have an application responded to. It is a good idea to operate in this way, while ensuring that children receive the service appropriate to their needs. It is hoped that by providing extra resources, children who go through the school system and who might have received special attention in senior infants or first class may not need it in second or third class.</P>
        <P>The low ratio to which the Deputy referred was worked out on the basis that approximately 3% of children would require a more intensive programme for two and a half hours. These children can still apply individually, based on the psychological report, for that level of resources.</P>

        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act suggests that children will be entitled to an individual assessment and statement of needs, yet this quota system is taking away that right before the legislation is even implemented. Will the Minister comment on that aspect?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not accept this is the case. It targets the 10% of children who are expected to have learning difficulties in the field of literacy and numeracy. We will continue to make special provision for children with extra special needs and those with more severe difficulties who fall into the 3% category. Their needs will continue to be met. However, the idea is that support will be in place for children who may need a little help with their literacy. I do not accept that the legislation removes children&rsquo;s rights. In fact, it will ensure their needs are met more quickly rather than having to endure the cost involved and engaging in the cumbersome task of making an individual application.</P>

        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy opened in September 1996 with provisional recognition and was granted permanent recognition in 2000. My Department provides grant aid towards the rental of temporary accommodation for the school at a rate of 95% of the rental costs.</P>
        <P>The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in regard to site acquisitions generally, is exploring the possibility of acquiring a site for the school referred to by the Deputy. Due to commercial sensitivities, I am unable to comment further on specific site acquisitions. The permanent accommodation needs of this school are being addressed as expeditiously as possible and the provision of a permanent building for the school will be progressed when a site has been acquired.</P>

        <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the current situation is desperate for the 198 pupils and nine teachers involved, a number which continues to grow? Does she agree that the school, which already has 12 children on the waiting list for the 2005-06 school year, has already been forced to move three times? It already consists of <Col N="82" />five second-hand pre-fab buildings. The school has received notice to quit these buildings by 2006 and the lease is non-renewable. Does the Minister agree that 200 pupils will be on the street in 15 months&rsquo; time unless alternative accommodation is provided?</P>
        <P>I received a reply to a question last December that the OPW was examining the site. Does the Minister agree that the OPW was asked in 2001 to examine the site and it decided in 2004 that it was not successful? Does she agree that this is a problematic situation for the school which is in a highly populated area and which received permanent recognition from the Department? A report on the health and safety aspects, which the board of management commissioned, is shocking. The five pre-fab buildings were bought second-hand six years ago and suffer dry rot and wet rot. Given all this and the eviction notice to the school, the Minister will need to be more specific in her reply to the good people of Westport. Is she saying that this is not a priority situation and, if not, why not?</P>

        <P>There were 39 recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences, four of which do not apply to the education sector. Their costed proposals total &euro;244 million, of which &euro;66.3 million would be a recurring annual cost. Progress has been made on 25 of the recommendations. In particular, important progress is being made in regard to curricular reform and in-service support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry, revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science <Col N="83" />beginning in schools in 2003-04, and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All these developments are being or have been supported by national in-service programmes for teachers.</P>
        <P>Another development is resourcing, with substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002, an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate, a capital grants programme for senior cycle science, information and communications technology and science equipment, the implementation of a once-off grant scheme to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus, and ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative and the new TV Scope programme in partnership with RTE, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the National Centre for Technology in Education.</P>
        <P>Other developments include the provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path, reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science and initial reports on teacher training undertaken. Awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges and which link with schools have been introduced, and the new discover science and engineering programme was launched in October 2003 which brings together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy. Investment in the programme for research in third level institutes continues apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.</P>

        <P>That reply is practically identical to one I received from the previous Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on 30 June 2004. I would not have submitted the question if I thought I would receive the same reply, because it is already on the record. I submitted the question again because I wanted to know what progress has been made since June 2004. I presume the answer is none, because if there had been progress, I may have received a different response to my question today.</P>
        <P>As the OECD report has since been published, my question does not relate to that. That report pointed out a number of aspects, including the fact that we are engaged in a catching-up process that will require sustained investment over a long period. The task force on physical sciences should have been the beginning in this regard. If progress has not been made in the last six months in implementing the recommendations, rather than quoting what has happened following the report, how does the Minister intend to progress the remaining recommendations? Some progress has been made on 25 of the recommendations but there has been no progress on 14 of the recom<Col N="84" />mendations, ten of which are the responsibility of her Department. How does the Minister intend to go forward with the implementation of the task force?</P>

        <P>I am committed to ensuring that we increase the standards of science and the facilities available to its teaching in our schools. Before Christmas I allocated capital funding for schools for science and science teaching. Equally, some of the proposals involve extraordinary expense though they would no doubt be very valuable, such as the employment of school laboratory assistants, which would cost an extra &euro;18.8 million annually. This would raise questions for other practical subject teachers such as woodwork, metalwork and home economics teachers, who would not have assistance. Such assistance in those areas is not found throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>We invested substantially in the development of school science laboratories last year and this year to upgrade them so that the syllabus can be introduced as needed. We are moving forward in every way we can but some developments, such as employing laboratory assistants, are not currently feasible. Other major developments such as in-teacher training can, however, have a huge impact on schools and teaching if new approaches are introduced. The use of technology and its application will also help the development of the sciences.</P>

        <P>The allocation to the schools building and modernisation programme for 2005 amounts to &euro;493 million of which &euro;270 million is being allocated to schools at primary level and &euro;223 million to post-primary level. This represents an increase of 14% on last year&rsquo;s allocation. The programme is underpinned not only by a significant increase in overall funding but also by major improvements in the administration and management of the funding.</P>
        <P>My Department is moving toward a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority as appropriate for building projects directly to school management authorities. The devolving of funding to local level will allow schools to have ownership of their projects and assist in moving projects in a specific timeframe to tender and construction and will also deliver better value for money. I have indicated that I plan to increase the level of funding available to schools under the small and rural schools initiative and I will make further announcements in this regard shortly.</P>
        <P>The introduction of multi-annual capital envelopes requires a revised approach to how building projects are scheduled through the design process and on to tender and construction. Projects must be in the pipeline so that there is a smooth flow of projects through all stages.</P>
        <P>The experience in 2004, whereby a record number of projects were selected for proceeding to tender and construction at a single time, while ideal in the context of announcing the entire building programme in one annual announcement, makes it less easy to take account of emerging trends generally and specific issues arising on individual projects such as delays in getting planning permission. I decided, therefore, to announce details last month of 122 major projects which will prepare tenders and move to construction in the next 12 to 15 months. While some of the projects will be ready to go on site earlier in the year than others, all the projects should be capable of being put on site in that timescale.</P>
        <P>I will follow this recent announcement with a series of announcements relating to the school building and modernisation programme that will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships, an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding, details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme which is being allocated &euro;60 million, almost twice that spent in 2004, schools whose projects will further progress through the design process and schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the changes to the format of the school building programme will in no way detract from the level of openness and transparency which is an ongoing feature of the programme.</P>

        <P>I thank the Minister for her answer. I take her point about transparency but <Col N="86" />there remains much confusion abroad. The document that people could download to see exactly where their school stood provided a great deal of transparency that does not appear to be there this year.</P>
        <P>Regarding last year&rsquo;s funding, the Minister told us in the House on 25 November that primary and post-primary schools would not be at a loss as a result of underspending last year and that the &euro;50 million was all she expected to have to carry forward. Media reports suggest that there may by tens of millions of euro lost to the schools building fund. Will the Minister clarify that point and say whether money was lost to that fund or whether it was only the &euro;50 million which was to be carried over?</P>
        <P>The Minister seemed to suggest there would be more schools on the devolved list this year. Will she say if that is the case? There is a concern in growing areas, particularly around Dublin in counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, about the urgent need for school places. They are not getting much information from the Department, particularly where site acquisition is involved. Will the Minister clarify matters for those people in desperate situations who feel they will not have school places for their children in the near future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The document referred to will be available for all to see, as it was before. It is being done in stages. The only information currently available relates to the 122 projects at the top of the list, ready to go to tender, to go on site and proceed towards construction. The next list will be of the small and rural schools projects and the permanent accommodation projects which I hope to organise soon, with the other projects which I have set out. We will also announce and place on the website the stage reached by every school in the country and what stage each is moving to. Rather than doing this with one big-bang approach we will be able to keep a better eye on the flow of work. All the information will be available, open and transparent, on the website, as it was before, with links for further information.</P>
        <P>I intend to increase the number of schools under the devolved scheme. It worked very well, particularly in rural areas where we were able to get good value for money with local builders, people who perhaps might have had an interest in the local school or were parents of children at the school. They were able to do the work well locally. Given the success of that and that half the schools in the country have four or fewer teachers, that is an appropriate way to proceed, to give schools devolved funding.  I have also doubled the amount under the summer works scheme because over the summer months many schools will be able to sort out, under that funding, any real problems they have.</P>
        <P>Last year&rsquo;s underspend happened for various reasons, including planning permission and so on. An appeal in one case meant that there was an underspend of &euro;2 million on a single school. <Col N="87" />There were difficulties in getting tenders, site purchasing, delays from design teams and so on, but the good news is that there was no money lost to the system and we were allowed to carry forward the &euro;50 million. Nothing was lost in the end.</P>

        <P>No. We carried forward the exact amount we were allowed. No capital funding was lost. We were allowed to carry forward &euro;50 million and we did so. Quite a number of bills arrived towards the end of the year, as they tend to, but nothing was lost. The lessons learned from the delays last year are helping me to feed into the process this year for the building programme to ensure we have enough in the system to move it along.</P>

        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, provided a capital envelope of &euro;555 million in respect of education PPPs for the period 2005-08. My officials are examining how this may be best utilised. A number of issues will have to be determined before I make a decision on the allocation of these funds.</P>
        <P>Those include the type of PPP model to be used, the level of operation and service to be included in any new programme, how the projects should be bundled so as to provide the most cost-effective procurement and the size and geographical spread of the bundles. Only new building projects on green-field sites that have been prioritised using the criteria agreed with the education partners and published by my Department are eligible for consideration under my Department&rsquo;s PPP programme. I will be announcing the programme in the near future.</P>
        <P>One of the most striking aspects of my Department&rsquo;s PPP programme to date is the high quality of design and materials. By investing up front in design and construction, the cost of ongoing maintenance over the 25 year contract is significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>Speed of delivery is one of the very attractive aspects of PPPs. The total time required to procure the five schools using the PPP approach was around three and a half years. Under the traditional approach to the procurement of new schools, the comparable elapsed time typically averages four to five years. The pilot project has provided the State with five exceptional schools, fully serviced and maintained over the next 25 years.</P>
        <Col N="88" />
        <P>Ultimately, the full value for money represented by PPPs, including my Department&rsquo;s grouped schools project, will be determined over the 25-year life cycle of the project. It is too early in the life of the contract to carry out such an assessment. That point was acknowledged by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the grouped schools&rsquo; pilot project.</P>
        <P>My Department is an active participant in the interdepartmental group on PPPs headed by the Department of Finance&rsquo;s central PPP unit, whose remit is to provide guidance and support to the PPP process in the public sector. The lessons and experience gained during the schools&rsquo; pilot project have significantly assisted the formulation of that guidance. In addition, the National Development Finance Agency was established as a result of the pilot PPP programme to provide expert financial advice and assistance to the public sector for major capital projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
        <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister might comment on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s point regarding the fact that the schools so far constructed cost more than they would have if built under the normal system. Secondly, concerns have been documented about PPPs in Britain. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the long-term implications. Has she had any complaints about access to the schools for other community purposes in the evening, or are the PPP schools available to the community for night classes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The cost of the schools can really only be ascertained over the long term. The chances are that the schools now built under PPP would not yet have been built otherwise, meaning the costs would have gone up in the meantime. There is no doubt that they are state-of-the-art schools with superb facilities, but were we to start building them now, which is probably about right, they would cost us a great deal more. As I said, the benefits can be seen over the longer term. Learning from the PPP process happening in the UK was behind these pilot projects. They were a learning experience, and we learned from building those schools, using that experience in building the National Maritime College in Cork, which has now become the benchmark for PPP procurement. We have already gained from the expertise of building the schools, and that experience will now feed into our ongoing PPP programme.</P>
        <P>Access to the schools is very good. I believe that they were offered 320 hours outside the normal school day for community use, adult education, sports facilities that could be rented out to local groups and for parent-teacher meetings and other activities that would go on in the school. I have not heard anyone say that it was not sufficient for them. Part of the contract for the maintenance is that lighting and heating must be available every day. I understand that quite good use is being made of them, in particular, Ballincollig has a superb adult education centre run through <Col N="89" />the school using all the facilities of the school after normal hours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>Who sets the costs for community use and is it viable and affordable for all communities? There have been some teething problems. It has been said to me in one of the schools that I visited that basic repairs can be difficult since, instead of simply going to the Department, one must now go to the company and then to the Department. That can be for quite small matters. For larger concerns, it is not a problem and is probably better than the regular building programme, but I believe that it can be difficult for small things.</P>
        <P>Some of the schools that I visited have very visible machines vending Coke and similar products, as well as a fast-food element in their canteens rather than healthier food options. That seems to be outside the control of the school principal and the board of management, and perhaps the Minister might comment on it. I know some schools are hopeful of being included in the PPP process when it is announced in the coming weeks but are anxious to retain control over such issues within the school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>Regarding community use, the idea is that the school becomes a community asset. Under the terms of the project agreement, it is the operator who can market the school premises to generate income. The agreement provides that schools each have access to the premises for 350 hours outside the normal school day, which is quite substantial. Initially, the schools thought that 150 hours would be enough. I have already mentioned the school in Ballincollig, and Jarvis entered into an agreement on use of the fitness facilities in the community school in Shannon, generating income for the school. Jarvis appears to be the people who can market that.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I might also answer the question relating to fast food. We are considering that regarding any future PPPs. They all have canteen facilities and serve hot food, so we want to ensure it is healthy. It is a strange irony that people who have spent years giving out about the Department now find it more difficult dealing with a private company.</P>

        <Quest>if the full statutory remit of the national educational psychological service is being implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>In February 1999, the Government decided to establish the national educational psychological service with delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students who need it in primary and post-primary schools and in other relevant centres supported by my Department. The Government also agreed that NEPS should be established in the first instance on an administrative basis as a dedicated executive agency of my Department and with an initial development period of five years.</P>
        <P>NEPS was established accordingly with effect from 1 September 1999. It has not been established on a statutory basis and remains part of my Department. Following the recruitment of additional psychologists, there are now 128 psychologists in NEPS, compared with just 43 in 1999. Taking account of psychologists elsewhere in the educational system, it is estimated that there is now a total of approximately 145 in the sector.</P>
        <P>The last Civil Service Commission panel of 69 entry-level psychologists has recently been exhausted and my Department is currently in contact with the Department of Finance with a view to securing sanction for the recruitment of additional psychologists to NEPS before the end of 2005. Further recruitment will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004, NEPS was providing a full psychological service to approximately 60% of schools and 75% of pupils. To provide an assessment service to those schools that do not yet have access to the full NEPS service, my Department also funds NEPS to operate the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments.</P>
        <P>Currently, NEPS has 28 administrative staff. As well as staff based in head office, NEPS staff are based in eight regional offices and in 11 local offices, the latter figure including several temporary offices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister said regarding the weighted system that the rationale is that children will not have to wait for as long as previously. However, I conducted a survey last year that showed that one in four had been waiting for more than nine months to be assessed by NEPS despite, I imagine, the extra resources outside NEPS assessments, or the scheme of commissioning as the Minister terms it. Does the Minister know the current figure or how long the waiting list is? Does she agree that many of the <Col N="91" />delays were within NEPS or her Department and that it was not the fault of the children, their parents or, in many instances, the schools? The Minister says the delay is necessary for the weighted system, but that was within the control of her Department. Perhaps we should examine that before we consider other systems to resolve the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>One difficulty that could be identified is that not all psychologists are willing to work in all areas, and it is becoming difficult to recruit psychologists to work in particular areas throughout the country. They are now working to try to target their recruitment and let people know in advance where they will be working to meet the needs in those areas. That is the reason the scheme has been successful in terms of commissioning psychological assessments outside that. As well as providing the service, the national psychological education service also works closely with the schools to find ways to support the school and the teacher in the classroom. It does tremendous work also with the family. It is important to acknowledge the various tragedies that have affected our schools over the past few years, and even in the past few weeks. NEPS provides a tremendous support service to all children in the school and to schools in dealing with crises. That is added work it does in addition to its own work.</P>

I had intended asking her about the regional spread, and I welcome the fact that the next round will target areas. Will the Minister confirm that the panel is exhausted, with the 69 personnel now employed? A person who was on the panel had been interested in a position in Inishowen but there was an outstanding issue with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If the Minister cannot answer that question I can give her the details of the case later.</P>
        <P>On cross-Border co-operation for areas along the Border that could have a service provided on a cross-Border basis, is there a facility within NEPS to accommodate the availability of resources outside our own jurisdiction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>My understanding is that the panel has been exhausted. I do not know about the individual case regarding Inishowen but I would be happy to check that for the Deputy, as I will do in respect of the cross-Border facility.

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>if she will fund the recent plan advanced by the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities which would guarantee university places for students who are exempt from paying fees to sit the leaving certificate (details supplied); and her views on this proposal.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>During 2004, the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities, CHIU, indicated to my Department and the Higher Education Authority that the seven universities were considering the introduction of an alternative entry process whereby leaving certificate students whose family hold a medical card could apply for a higher education place through a separate process from the general points system. Applicants would not be required to achieve the same leaving certificate points as their peers, but would be eligible for selection on achievement of 300 points or more. Some 5% or approximately 750 places for new entrants would be available in all faculties in the seven universities.</P>
        <P>Currently, approximately 590 places in the university sector are filled by socio-economically disadvantaged students through an existing direct entry scheme, which is principally funded through the HEA&rsquo;s strategic initiative scheme. Criteria to select students includes a range of social as well as economic indicators, including family income, parental occupation and parental education levels.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in and supportive of the approach being taken by the HEA in favour of the concept of core funding structures incentivising increased participation of students from all backgrounds. It is in this context that the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education was asked for its advice on the CHIU proposal, estimated to cost an additional &euro;25 million per annum, as well as a recently received similar proposal from the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology which proposes an estimated additional expenditure of &euro;15 million per annum for the technological sector.</P>
        <P>I have asked the national office in the HEA to undertake a review of the effectiveness of the existing range of initiatives to promote and support access to higher education from the non-traditional or socio-economically disadvantaged <Col N="93" />target groups. In its recently published national plan, the national office identified a range of goals and actions to bring about increased participation from the groups who have, to date, been under-represented in higher education. These include learners with a disability, mature students, disadvantaged school leavers and members of the Traveller community and ethnic minorities.</P>
        <P>The national office has just begun implementation of a 2005-07 national plan to achieve equity of access to higher education. An action point prioritised in the plan is to ensure that socio-economically disadvantaged students, schools and communities are linked to an access programme in at least one higher education institution. The CHIU proposal is being considered in this context. A key issue in relation to the proposals from the CHIU and Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology will be the level of additionality which these proposals will involve in respect of the key target groups and the extent to which progress will be made by the institutions in supporting retention of students after admission as well as facilitating transfer and progression within and between the further and higher education sectors.</P>
        <P el="10" Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
        <P>Given the substantial additional costs envisaged for plans from the CHIU and the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology, it is essential that the proposals are fully examined by the national office in the HEA and I await the views of that office. When I receive these views I will consider the proposals from the sector in the context of ensuring that available funds are properly targeted.</P>
        <P>In this regard, spending on third level access measures funded directly by my Department has increased from &euro;0.5 million in 1997 to &euro;34 million in 2005. The maximum rate of maintenance grant, including the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant, is &euro;4,855, compared to &euro;2,032 in 1997. In addition, the HEA through its strategic targeted initiatives provided approximately &euro;7.3 million in 2004 to support access. This represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources. Moreover, in the academic year 2003-04, about 9,000 third level students were awarded &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants. This represents almost 7% of the total third level enrolment.</P>

        <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I congratulate both the universities and the institutes of technology on taking an interest in this area. I accept that the Minister has asked the equity office to examine the proposals but will she be in a position to make a decision on this matter for the forthcoming academic year? On a point of clarification, the Minister referred to 590 places. I presume this proposal is in addition to those places. Are we talking about extra places?</P>

        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan has hit the nail on the head. We have asked them to indicate whether these will be additional places because it is not quite clear. To be honest, I doubt that they are additional because I am sure those already included in the 590 are people who would have medical cards. The medical card alone is too narrow a criterion because the way it works is that other indicators are considered, including family income, parental occupation and parental education levels, which are equally valuable in determining whether somebody is at an educational disadvantage as opposed to a medical disadvantage, which is the position in the case of the medical card. That is the reason all those elements must be examined. We must ensure we can increase the number of people from those backgrounds getting into third level education and not have universities or the institutes, which I know are working from a good motivation, come up with a scheme that would only allow us the same number of students in the system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
        <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

        <P>Perhaps I am being presumptuous in suggesting that Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan almost agrees that medical card might be too narrow a criterion. We must examine all the other areas. I attended the national access conference in Kilkenny where I met one of the students who was from a very disadvantaged background in Cork. He was trying to work his way through the system based on grants but he told me that he aspired to being in the top tax bracket, which I thought was a great aspiration for a young man.</P>

        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is an all-Irish primary school serving the west Dublin area. As the Deputy is aware, the area in question experienced rapid development in recent years requiring a significant number of interventions by my Department to ensure that <Col N="95" />emerging demands for extra school accommodation were met. These interventions comprised a combination of the expansion of existing capacity, where this was possible, and the provision of new greenfield site schools.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the specific school referred to by the Deputy is that last year an application for the recognition of a second Gaelscoil was received in my Department. In accordance with established procedures, the application was referred to the New Schools Advisory Committee, an independent body set up for the purpose of assessing and making recommendations in these matters.</P>
        <P>In its report to my predecessor, the NSAC recommended that any extra all-Irish provision required in the area should be met, in the first instance, by extending the existing facility if this were possible. This is in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy and the recommendation of the NSAC was, therefore, accepted.</P>
        <P>The patron body of the proposed new school appealed the recommendation before the new schools independent appeals board. The appeal was not upheld and the recommendation of the NSAC, therefore, remained unchanged. Plans then commenced to expand the existing school commensurate with the level of demand presenting. The agreement of the patron was secured for this course of action.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the ethos of a school is impaired by size. In this instance, the school will remain an all-Irish facility and teaching resources will be provided to correspond with growth in pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>With regard to appropriate accommodation, I recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005. The school in question is one of those earmarked to progress in this manner. Pending delivery of permanent accommodation, temporary accommodation will be provided to meet the school&rsquo;s immediate needs for September 2005.</P>
        <P>I stress to the Deputy the importance of optimising the use of existing provision as a means of meeting demand in areas of rapid population growth. Site costs place a huge strain on my Department&rsquo;s ability to deliver new school buildings and all schools must be prepared to expand to meet demand where site conditions make this possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister is undoubtedly aware that the board of management of Gaelscoil Naomh Ph&aacute;draig has expressed serious reservations about the proposals to expand from eight to 24 classrooms. The new influx will mean that many pupils will not have any grounding in Irish at naonra&iacute; level and they may affect the ethos of <Col N="96" />the school in terms of there being a uniform level of ability with Irish language among junior infants. Some of these children will have attended naonra&iacute; and will be fluent for their age in Irish. However, this will not be the case with the others. There are concerns that if two thirds of the new students do not possess the necessary grounding, the Irish language capabilities of the school may be affected.</P>
        <P>Another issue of concern is that the school is extremely overcrowded, has only one astro turf pitch and is using its small PE area as a classroom at present. While it welcomes moves in respect of additional buildings, the school suggests that, particularly when the recreational needs of the children are considered, 16 classrooms would be more than sufficient for the site. It is also felt that putting in place 24 classrooms would be an overuse of the site, particularly under the Department&rsquo;s regulations. Is the Minister aware that the minimum number of pupils appear to have been signed up in respect of the proposal for an additional Gaelscoil in the Lucan-Palmerstown area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I am aware that the board of management, contrary to the wishes of its patron, is opposed to growing the facility. However, all other schools would be asked to expand to meet such a need and it is in that context that the Gaelscoil is being asked to do so. In this instance the Department owns the site which means that we are not obliged to search for another site on which to build a second Gaelscoil, particularly as the need can be met on the current site.</P>
        <P>I do not accept go mbeadh daoine ag cur isteach ar chaighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge. The standard of Irish in Gaelscoileanna is tremendous. Throughout the country, children who do not come from all-Irish speaking households are entering junior infants in Gaelscoileanna. They are, therefore, entering these schools to learn Irish for the first time. I have no doubt that the quality of the teaching at this Gaelscoil will, as it has at other Gaelscoileanna, remain high.</P>

        <P>My Department recently approved the provision of temporary accommodation for the school in question in respect of its additional accommodation requirements for September 2005. Officials from my Department visited this school on 26 January and agreed a proposed location on the site for the temporary accommodation. My Department&rsquo;s technical staff, who will manage the delivery of this temporary accommodation, will now commence work <Col N="97" />on the necessary documentation to secure planning permission and fire certificate clearance.</P>
        <P>The position in respect of the additional permanent needs of this school is that this project is one of 122 projects recently announced that are listed to go to tender and construction over the next 12 to 15 months. My Department&rsquo;s building unit arranged general information meetings for these schools to guide them through the process involved in moving projects to tender and construction. These meetings took place on 1 February in Tullamore and representatives from the school in question attended.</P>

        <P>Notwithstanding concerns that it would be preferable to have 16 rather than 24 classrooms on the site, Lucan is facing a schools crisis which, thankfully, was addressed to some degree by the fast-tracking of the Griffeen Valley Educate Together school. However, difficulties remain as regards the non-use of Adamstown. Parents are concerned that school should be open to as many pupils as possible by September 2005. The patron body does not have access to the information on the ground. If the Minister is not willing to listen to the concerns expressed by the board and is determined to put in place 24 classrooms, I hope that a minimum of three junior streams will be able to commence at the school at the beginning of September.</P>

        <P>As a result of uncertainty, until this year the Gaelscoil had no option but to limit its numbers. However, it also adopted the position that, as regards the 2005-06 year, it would not take on any more children. The Department wrote to the board of management stating that arrangements should be made for a three-stream intake in September 2005 and that accommodation would be provided to cater for this enrolment. Assuming that the board of management does as it has been asked, with the guarantee that the temporary accommodation will be in place, parents will be able to obtain enrolment places for their children.</P>

        <P>In her initial reply the Minister referred to the meetings held in Tullamore in respect of 122 schools. If schools included in that number have a short lifetime left to them and approval of planning permission is six or eight months away, this would mean that the projects could not start and finish within the envisaged 15-month timeframe. Will such schools be able to remain within the programme or will they be removed and dealt with differently? What will be the position?</P>

        <P>Our intention is to progress each of the 122 projects as quickly as possible. Those encountering constraints as regards planning permissions will have to get their skates on. It is the responsibility of the schools to ready their documents for tender, employ architects etc. The <Col N="98" />Department will support them in that regard. It is our intention to have all under construction within the 12 to 15-month timeframe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>At primary level, physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. In regard to equipment, the position is that this is a cost which falls to be met from the capitation grant paid towards the running costs of schools. In respect of facilities, many primary schools have a general purposes room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent facilities such as public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. Going forward, the provision of multi-purpose space for primary schools will continue to be considered within the design brief for new schools and renovation and extension projects. This will be done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.</P>
        <P>At second level, while physical education is not a mandatory subject, it should form part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on the Department&rsquo;s approved syllabi and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The time recommended for physical education is two hours per week.</P>
        <P>The phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for physical education &mdash; non-examination &mdash; commenced in September 2003. PE halls are integrated into overall plans in the case of new second level school building projects and extensions. In addition, generic templates are being developed to standardise the construction of PE halls in second level schools which do not have PE halls or a major capital project.</P>
        <P>The syllabi at primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities <Col N="99" />undertaken so that each school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. No timescale for implementation has been decided upon for introduction of physical education as an examination subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Does the Minister intend to make physical education a mandatory subject at second level? I am not too concerned in this regard because I believe the majority of students at second level engage in PE.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of the opinion that the one hour of PE per week at primary level is sufficient? It may be appropriate in the early stages of primary education but what about when children go into fifth and sixth class? There are many schools which, in light of the type of weather we get in Ireland, are not in a position to offer one hour of PE per week. A large number of schools use their GP rooms as classrooms, while others do not have GP rooms. Does the Minister envisage a situation where applications by these schools for GP rooms to allow them to provide physical education will be considered? If the desire to engage in PE is not developed in children at primary level, they are hardly likely to take it up at second level. Is the Minister of the opinion that this may be a greater issue for female students at primary level who may not be in a position to participate in sports outside school hours at the same level as boys or that many of the team sports etc., available are slightly more geared towards boys, although I accept that the position is changing? Does she believe girls are not necessarily able to avail of the same opportunities and that these should be provided in school?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I am not so sure the weather is so bad in Ireland that people cannot get out that much. We have just had the mildest winter in years. However, notwithstanding that, I have no immediate plans to make PE an exam subject. It is important that the degree of flexibility currently in place should be availed of, using the talents of the staff as well, while recognising that very many schools are involved in sport, quite apart from PE, whether it is Gaelic games, hockey, basketball or whatever. People give much of their time to such activities.</P>
        <P>As regards PE halls, they are now being included as part and parcel of major extensions and in new schools. This is very important. We have had a programme for last year carrying on into 2005 of some PE halls being developed. These will be used as a model to determine how we can progress further. There is much demand from schools around the country. Primary schools that are simply looking for general purpose space would neither fit into band 1 or band 2 at present. We obviously have to meet the need for basic <Col N="100" />classroom accommodation and ancillary work that is required. However, under the devolved scheme we find that a number of schools have been imaginative in the manner in which they use the money, topped up perhaps with local fund-raising, so that these types of facility are being improved. Did the Deputy have another question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister has covered it. It was about access to sports for girls and boys.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I know this will be a source of debate within the Department&rsquo;s building unit, but as regards the PE halls that have been developed, the Deputy may be aware a number of them have a balcony, which is enormously expensive in the context of a building programme. I understand from girls, however, that it is very successful because that is where the fitness suites are located. The girls are starting to use that area and of course it is cut off from the rest of the school and from people down below who might be using the sports facilities. That is something I shall have to keep in mind for the future, even though it adds substantially to building costs. I have always been conscious of the fact that teenage girls do not like to do PE. It obviously has to do with age, self-esteem and all of those other matters and perhaps the shower facilities in schools. We should work on anything that encourages them to be fitter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister is aware, however, that to engage in physical activity not only can help to set one up for the rest of one&rsquo;s life but can assist with increased academic performance, given the enhanced cardiovascular element. Will she acknowledge that there is an urgent need in second level for PE to be made mandatory to some degree, possibly as a subject in the first three years, which would, at least get students involved? Once they get involved they will stay involved.</P>
        <P>As regards primary level, she has already mentioned that progress is being made on PE halls in new buildings. What are her plans for smaller schools in rural areas which are in danger of closure? As I have previously flagged as regards integrated partnerships between community and sports bodies etc., there is scope for the available space in some school buildings to be used as a multi-purpose facility. The cost could be shared among the local authority, community bodies, the sports councils and the Department of Education and Science in a way that would not affect the safety of the children concerned, but which could be cost-effective in providing facilities not provided by a school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>As regards PE as a subject for the junior certificate, it is expected that it will be integrated into the curriculum. I am conscious of not overloading the curriculum even further with <Col N="101" />another exam subject. It might have to be looked at in the overall reform context. I confess I am increasingly conscious of schools that are looking for PE halls on the basis that other schools in a town have them. That has happened at least twice recently. I wonder whether we will ever arrive at a situation where school management will actually share facilities and talk to each other. This is what Deputy Gogarty has asked me about in respect of primary schools. It is working to some degree in primary schools because the local community has greater ownership, particularly in the case of the rural schools, as referred to by the Deputy. However, it is not happening to the degree I would like at second level, particularly when we are providing state-of-the-art PE facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney">
        <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
        <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I see great opportunity for co-operation between the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Department of Education and Science as regards the availability of facilities. Ultimately, they share the same goal, to get young people and the not so young moving in the same direction because of academic performance as well as physical and mental well-being.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister thought about developing cooperation with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism on the idea of opening up the schools, perhaps on a commercial basis? She referred to the installation of fitness suites. There is no reason why after school activity should not yield a commercial return while at the same time helping with the upkeep of the school in terms of lighting and heating costs.</P>
        <P>On the issue of forward planning, in a town such as mine, for example, there is a new community college that was in the top five of sporting schools without a PE hall. Perhaps in a few years time there will be an opportunity for the Gaelscoileanna to go forward. If there is a potential for them to develop on greenfield sites located close to existing schools, then perhaps facilities could be shared. Has the Department any plans along these lines? Such initiatives must come from the Department as well as the local communities if duplication is to be curtailed. I am in complete support of Deputy Gogarty on the grounds that PE and music are the first to be hit when education budgets are squeezed and yet they are as central to the cognitive and physical development of the child as any other subject and perhaps more so. However, people do not accept this because the emphasis is on the &ldquo;three Rs&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
        <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>Is any priority being given to children who otherwise might not have much access to open space? I am thinking in particular of children going to school in an inner city environment. There was a programme on the radio <Col N="102" />recently about inner city Dublin where there is little access to open space outside school hours. I wonder whether those types of schools will be given priority as regards PE activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue is very supportive of the provision of sports facilities for communities. Obviously, where that may be done in conjunction with education, it is the way forward. The difficulty is that the Department of Education and Science does not own most of the schools throughout the country. In general a board of management is in place and the schools are owned by a community or an order, so the Department is not in a position to stipulate that the space should be made available. That said, where PE halls are located in community and VEC colleges, in general they are made available to the wider community. However, the Department has no control over situations where it does not own the schools. We have been reviewing planning norms in respect of areas where primary and second-level developments are taking place to see whether it might be possible to build education campuses. This could perhaps accommodate primary and secondary school levels along with the sharing of facilities. We are examining that in our negotiations over particular sites, to see how space may be optimised. That is the way forward. The ideal, of course, would be to have a greenfield site everywhere when wonderful things could be done.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the needs of inner cities and heavily urbanised areas. Given that so much money is going into small and rural schemes, I am anxious that greater attention should be paid to people with particular needs in large urban areas. It is not always possible to meet those needs, however, because of space constraints.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the provisions of the new national testing system for primary schools; when it is likely to be introduced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I have made no decision as regards the systematisation of testing in primary schools. In response to a request from my predecessor, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently preparing advice on issues relating to standardised testing for pupils during their compulsory schooling. It is my intention to defer decisions until I am fully informed regarding the potential and the limitations of standardised testing and until I have explored the range of options available. The advice of the NCCA, which I expect to receive before Easter, will help to shape my thinking. I understand the formulation of the NCCA advice is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <Col N="103" />
        <P>My approach will be to weigh the benefits to pupils, parents, schools and the system against the costs in terms of the inputs required and the consequences that are likely to result. This will involve consultation as well as intensive listening and reflection on my part.</P>
        <P>There is widespread acceptance of the value of standardised tests as one of a range of modes of assessment to help teachers make more informed decisions in relation to the instruction of pupils, to inform parents of pupils&rsquo; progress and to provide information relevant to the identification of pupils that may require additional support. The fact that more than 95% of our primary schools use standardised tests is testimony to the value our teachers ascribe to them. In light of this, it seems desirable that all pupils and their parents should have the same entitlement to avail of standardised tests and to derive the benefit of the judicious use of their results.</P>
        <P>The tests can provide valuable information for teachers, principals and boards of management when engaging in a self-evaluation process. There is also a need to develop systems that will provide my Department with more regular information regarding progress and standards. Notwithstanding the benefits of standardised testing just outlined, it is understandable that any move to systematise their use can give rise to fears and concerns. There will be no question of requiring all pupils in certain classes to take a standardised test on one day. It is not my intention to use the results of standardised tests as a stand-alone criterion to determine the allocation of resources to individual pupils and individual schools, to measure the effectiveness of individual teachers and schools or to compile school league tables. The intention is to develop a considered and balanced policy on standardised testing. It should contribute to the current information deficit on the quality of the education system and support parents, teachers and schools in their efforts to make pupils&rsquo; learning experiences as fruitful and as beneficial to their needs as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan">
        <NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister should have received a report recently on literacy problems in disadvantaged schools which was of great concern. If these standardised tests are introduced, will resources be allocated to address the needs that are identified through the testing? If any kind of testing is brought in, the automatic response should be that the child that falls behind gets the support required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>The test should never be the only criteria used for allocating resources. It would be unfair as it would put undue pressure on children and on schools to perform or even to underperform to gain the resources. It would obviously feed in to our knowledge. Much of the evidence from the report to which the Deputy refers <Col N="104" />pointed to poor results on the basis of having no books at home and parents not reading to their children. We can easily identify that there is more to literacy levels in disadvantaged schools than just the relationship between the teacher and the child. That is why I would be anxious not to use one criterion, just like the medical card is not used on its own for access to university.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG">
        <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister said that 95% of schools use some kind of standardised testing. To what use does the Department put that information? Does it look at the special needs resources allocation, classification of disadvantage, or increased funding? If the information does not have a function, then what does the Department hope to achieve if testing were to be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>As there is a variety of testing used, it is not possible to use them to any great advantage.

These are things which the council is examining.</P>

She stated that she is not looking at providing a new national testing system at present. Will she consider allocating the resources that may go to such a testing system to the provision of additional educational welfare officers or an expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme? Many disadvantaged schools are very well resourced for special needs assistants but not so well resourced in the pupil-teacher ratio. However, they could have hands-on assistants which could be better than testing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
        <P>An ongoing debate is taking place within the House and throughout the country on the future of An Post and its staff. An Post has a considerable linkage system in place throughout the country which consists of a delivery service that is in touch with all aspects of society. It has post offices and sub-post offices located strategically and in such a way as to enable An Post to use its infrastructure to deliver services and facilities on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately, the postal and packaging services came unstuck and industrial action almost had to take place.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it was revealed that there are very poor industrial relations between management and staff and there is no investment in improving them. Will the Minister try to ensure that postal services in the form of distribution and packaging are continued into the foreseeable future? He should take full advantage of the situation with a view to ensuring that the continuity of the postal services is agreed. Owing to time constraints, it was not possible to get answers to a series of questions <Col N="106" />put by Members at the recent committee meeting. The time between now and when the committee next meets should be put to good use given that this is an important service that has delivered to all parts of the country and has become a vital institution.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why the parcel service must be discontinued at a time when the demand for parcel delivery services is increasing not just in this country but throughout the world. A notion seems to have become prevalent that with new electronic systems of messaging distribution there will be no necessity in the future for the old fashioned postal services. As I told the committee meeting yesterday, certain things cannot be transmitted electronically and one of them is a parcel, despite the best efforts of modern technology. It is imperative that every effort is made to secure the existing parcel delivery service and to develop that service. At the same time, every effort must be made to retain the current network of post offices and sub-post offices throughout the country. They have given good service.</P>
        <P>I was a Member of this House when the legislation establishing An Post was passed. It provided for the transfer of civil servants from the Civil Service to An Post. That legislation provided that the staff transferred would, in terms of remuneration and pensions, have an entitlement equal to that available to their colleagues in the Civil Service. At some stage, the lines got blurred and somebody decided that the responsibility would be transferred to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, that Minister must also have regard to the 1983 legislation.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
        <P>It would be useful to set out the background to the current difficulties being experienced following the decision of the board of An Post to close the company&rsquo;s parcels subsidiary, the special delivery service, SDS, and to reintegrate the parcels business back into the main company. There have been heavy losses in recent years at SDS. These losses amounted to &euro;18 million over a three year period to 2003, with losses of &euro;12 million in 2003 alone. Further heavy losses will be sustained in 2004. In these circumstances, the board of An Post, at its July meeting, decided to close SDS and to reintegrate the parcels business into the letter post division.</P>
        <P>A total of 180 SDS jobs will be reintegrated into letter post operations and an entirely voluntary redundancy package will be introduced for an anticipated 270 job losses. The redundancy package will be funded by SDS property disposals.</P>
        <Col N="107" />
        <P>It is my understanding that, following a request from ICTU, the national implementation body held a hearing to determine whether the company breached the partnership terms of Sustaining Progress in making its decision to reintegrate SDS. The national implementation body, as part of its determination, proposed that an independent facilitator be appointed to institute a process for information sharing, including financial details. Mr. Peter Cassells has been appointed as the facilitator and the process has been up and running for some time.</P>
        <P>Following recent industrial unrest at SDS in the run-up to the planned closure and in a renewed effort to resolve the issues surrounding that closure in as fair and transparent a manner as possible, the matter will come before the Labour Court on 11 February. Critically, both sides have agreed to be bound by the court&rsquo;s recommendation. In the meantime, the closure of SDS has been delayed for a short period to give the court the space and time to examine carefully the issues arising, with due regard to the interests of all parties.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?>
        <P>Turning to the wider picture in the postal services, the issues of the payment of Sustaining Progress increases to An Post employees, together with the agreement and implementation of the recovery strategy for the company, have also been referred to the Labour Court for arbitration. These issues will come to the court on 7 February.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>The company has pleaded &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo; Sustaining Progress increases following heavy losses amounting to &euro;43 million in 2003. This is an ongoing matter of dispute between union and management and no easy solution presents itself in view of the critical financial state of An Post. On the recovery strategy issue, the Labour Relations Commission has been involved in exhaustive discussion with management and unions throughout 2004. Despite some progress, agreement has not been reached between the parties on all the details of a viable and effective recovery plan for the company.</P>
        <P>It is essential that both sides continue to work together in conjunction with the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery to broker a deal that will allow the company to deliver quality services to our citizens while at the same time offering good well paid employment to its employees. I urge both parties to negotiate in partnership to achieve the necessary agreement that will enable An Post to meet the challenges facing the postal sector in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to raise the valid demand by the Coalition on Violence Against Women for a ring-fenced Supplementary Estimate for 2005 and a monthly annual funding package from 2006 onwards to ensure adequate financial support for front-line services for <Col N="108" />women who have survived domestic violence or sexual assault.</P>
        <P>The current funding arrangements are short term and insecure. There is widespread, consistent and persistent underfunding of these services. The net result is that the agencies providing these services, such as Women&rsquo;s Aid and the network of refuges and rape crisis centres throughout the country, cannot cope at present with the increased demand due to lack of resources. The Minister is well aware of this. These agencies have been subjected to an indefensible funding freeze over the past three years, in effect three years of cutbacks. The Government has also failed to ensure that such services are available in every county, as should be the case.</P>
        <P>I have been attempting to have this matter dealt with since December last year. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has washed his hands of it and passed it to his party colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. It appears that interdepartmental responsibility for services in this sector is being used as an excuse for inaction by the Government.</P>
        <P>Last week, I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform his plans to ensure that sexual assault forensic testing is available in every county to improve the worryingly low rate of successful prosecutions and convictions in this area. It is astonishing that such a basic facility is not available after almost ten years of the Celtic tiger economy. His reply was to pass the buck to the Minister for Health and Children. Simply put, justice for victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault is not a priority with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. His mind is elsewhere, on rounding up immigrants, setting up press councils or, indeed, wrecking the peace process.</P>
        <P>In responding to my questions on this issue, the Minister for Health and Children passed the buck in two directions, one to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who chairs the national steering committee on violence against women. The other was to the new Health Service Executive. There must be no more ducking and weaving. Women need justice and support rather than falling through the cracks of Government indifference.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister is aware of the statistics. Representatives of the sector made detailed submissions on this matter in recent years, particularly before last Christmas. The consequences of the funding freeze are real. Almost one quarter of Irish women have been abused by a current or former partner and almost half of all women have experienced some form of sexual abuse in their lifetime. The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, for example, received almost 12,000 calls in 2003. In the same year, refuges had to turn away at least 700 women and children. Women&rsquo;s Aid responded to nearly 13,000 calls but missed almost another 6,000 because it did not have enough staff.</P>
        <Col N="109" />
        <P>It is critical that there is a public commitment from the Minister on the required funding increase prior to the introduction of the Finance Bill 2005. Even though the Bill has been published, it is not too late to amend it. What we seek is very simple. We want increased funding for this sector in 2005 of &euro;7 million to bring the budgetary allocation to &euro;19 million. This level of funding would maintain existing services and allow for additional provision for those women who are otherwise likely to fall through the gaps. Furthermore, we seek the provision of a ring-fenced, multi-annual funding package from 2006 to ensure that the services in question do not suffer at the whim of a Minister for Finance with an eye to the next general election who decides there are not enough votes in front-line services for women and to ladle the gravy elsewhere.</P>

        <P>The Progressive Democrats are selling themselves to the public as a party of action and delivery.

        <P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Teachta an cheist seo &aacute; phl&eacute;.</P>
        <P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. The national steering committee on violence against women was established following the report of the task force on violence against women in 1997. As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh acknowledged, it is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department and the Health Service Executive are represented on the national steering committee. The purpose of the steering committee is to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency and cohesive response to the problem of violence against women and, in so doing, to progress the recommendations of the task force. The steering committee is representative of a wide range of interests concerned with violence against women.</P>
        <P>The committee has a number of objectives which include ensuring that regional and local structures are established, developing public awareness campaigns and co-ordinating and advising on the distribution of resources among the health regions. The committee is also responsible for co-ordinating and advising on the ongoing development of policies, including those involving perpetrators, criminal justice intervention, services and supports. The Government is committed to working with all interested parties including service providers and has implemented a range of measures to reduce the incidence of domestic violence, respond to the needs of victims and perpetrators and raise public awareness about the dynamics of this type of criminal activity. The effectiveness of the <Col N="110" />measures is best demonstrated through the Government&rsquo;s legislative measures, Garda responses, health services, the national steering committee on violence against women, national research and perpetrator programmes.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of the few European countries to have specific domestic violence legislation. The Domestic Violence Act 1996 describes domestic violence as &ldquo;any form of physical, sexual or psychological violence which puts the safety or welfare of a family member at risk&rdquo;. The legislation provides for a range of civil remedies to protect victims of domestic violence and its breach is a criminal offence. Protection is also offered through the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 which covers many forms of assault against the person.</P>
        <P>An assistant commissioner has been assigned specific responsibility for monitoring Garda policy on violence against women. Garda superintendents have responsibility for operations within their districts. The Garda has a proactive policy on domestic violence intervention and a nominated inspector in each division is responsible for ensuring it is implemented. The Garda domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit is based in Harcourt Square in Dublin and was given a national role in 1997. The Garda is represented on the national steering committee as well as on each of the regional committees on violence against women. All garda&iacute; receive training on the investigation of cases of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. Training is provided by experienced Garda personnel assisted by other professionals such as psychologists, doctors, social workers and experts from various non-governmental organisations.</P>
        <P>While service provision for victims comes primarily from the Department of Health and Children, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Environment and Local Government also respond to the issue. Funding in the health Vote has risen from approximately £3 million, &euro;3.8 million, in 1997 to approximately &euro;12 million in 2005. The level of funding shows the commitment of Government in addressing this important issue. The distribution of the funding is a matter for the Health Service Executive. We will continue to monitor the level of investment in services for women victims of domestic violence and work with the NGO sector to ensure there is adequate service provision to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>On foot of its examination of the role of the health and social services, the task force recommended, at the suggestion of my Department&rsquo;s representative, the examination by the Department of Health and Children of the need to establish additional sexual assault units around the country. The task force also recommended <Col N="111" />that &ldquo;systems be established to ensure that all necessary medical procedures are carried out in a timely, expert and sympathetic manner&rdquo;. It has since been agreed to establish a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations on how to move this issue forward. The group will meet within the next two weeks and the T&aacute;naiste has asked it to ensure it reports in time to allow any financial implications arising to be taken into account in the Estimates process this autumn.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
        <P>I bring to the attention of the House a matter which, if not addressed, may have tragic consequences. A natural gas supply has been installed in a significant number of houses, especially in urban areas, and some of the people concerned are sitting on a time bomb. While I am not an expert on gas, I have some points to raise. Has the natural gas Bill, due to be enacted in 2004, been enacted?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
        <P>My understanding is that the Bill which was promised for 2003 or 2004 has not been brought into effect. It is important to enact the legislation with the requisite amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I will deal with the Bill in my reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP">
        <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
        <P>My first concern involves the certification of people who install or repair gas services. The IS813 regulation requires people who install such services to have a certain certification and F&Aacute;S intermittently provides a gas installer training course for places on which there is usually a long waiting list. A safety assurance programme was established under the existing legislation by Bord G&aacute;is in 1987 according to which gas may be supplied without mandatory inspections only to installations which meet the programme&rsquo;s requirements. The programme requires an installer to have demonstrated the necessary competence in safe installation by completing the relevant F&Aacute;S course or holding an equivalent qualification. A random selection of inspections is carried out over a period of time and the system is regularly audited.</P>
        <P>My difficulty is that a promise was made in the context of the deregulation of the gas network that the new gas Bill would provide for certification. While a person installing a system is required to hold a certification, there are no penalties for an installer who does not. In nine times out of ten it is probable that a person who offers a service by dropping a card through one&rsquo;s door or advertising in the window of the local shop will do a competent job. However, if he or she does <Col N="112" />not apply the proper standards or lacks the proper training, there is nothing which can be done besides legal action to penalise him or her. Any legislation introduced should provide for stiff fines and penalties for anyone who installs or repairs gas equipment without having the proper qualifications.</P>
        <P>One of the main components of a gas pipe network is what is known as &ldquo;flux&rdquo;, which is used to solder together the pipe work. While I am not an expert on gas, I have spoken to a number of people involved in gas equipment installation. According to my sources, there are only one or two products which conform with international standards, including La-co power-flow flux, which is non-acidic and non-toxic. The difficulty with this flux is that it is harder to apply than other commonly employed fluxes. One requires a higher level of skill to use it, which is where the training comes in. If one does not have the higher level of skill, one is not able to use this proper, more expensive flux. The majority of fluxes used to solder gas pipes is corrosive, which means that over time the gas piping will corrode. If that happens, leakages will occur and, depending on where the gas is installed, that can lead to explosions. A legal action is being taken by residents in an estate in Leixlip, County Kildare, as a result of this problem.</P>
        <P>External fittings are also an issue but the flux issue needs to be addressed in legislation. The highest international standards must apply because if only one in 200,000 gas pipes corrodes because of an acidic flux, that is one too many in terms of putting people&rsquo;s lives in jeopardy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan">
        <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter, the reply to which I am making on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I understand the context in which the Deputy has raised this matter and I assume he is aware of the unfortunate incident in 2003 at Glendoher Close, Rathfarnham. All the members of the family involved were injured in an explosion. The family house exploded as a result of a leak of gas from a cast iron main which had fractured in the footpath outside and gas entered the house underground.</P>
        <P>Following that incident, Bord G&aacute;is accelerated its programme of replacement of cast iron mains. The circumstances of that incident were fully investigated at the time by the Commission for Energy Regulation. The report published by the commission recommended that Bord G&aacute;is put in place a parallel programme of cast iron mains replacement in areas where the ground was liable to subsidence. BGE had been engaged in systematically replacing the older networks over the past 17 years. Two thirds of the older networks have been replaced with modern polyethylene pipes. Prior to the incident, it had been intended to <Col N="113" />replace the remainder of the system over a ten to 15 year period. A full audit of these mains was carried out by BGE and the replacement programme has been accelerated and is being carried out on a reducing risk basis.</P>
        <P>During 2004, BGE developed a plan in conjunction with the CER to renew the final third of the system over the next five years. A total of 112 km of cast iron main was replaced in 2004. BGE proposes to renew approximately 200 km of cast iron main during 2005, with all remaining cast iron pipes due for renewal by end 2009. Arising from the audit of pipe work and risk analysis, the replacement programme is scheduled on a reducing risk basis whereby the highest category of risk is dealt with first and it is due to be fully completed by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>All the activities of distribution system operators are licensed and supervised by the Commission for Energy Regulation. This ensures that appropriate standards are implemented and adhered to, including standards for the physical durability of the system. These standards are determined by the National Standards Authority of Ireland through its gas technical standards committee. BGE is required under its licence conditions to produce a code of operations on all aspects of safe design, construction and operation of the network.</P>
        <P>On the issue of gas safety generally, legislative proposals to ensure the safety of the public, including the regulation of natural gas installers were published for consultation last November. These proposals will give the commission responsibility to regulate and promote safety and make it illegal for a person who is not a registered gas installer to work on a natural gas fitting. While a responsibility rests also with the homeowner to ensure he or she only engages reputable qualified installers to undertake work on domestic installations, the new legislation, when enacted, will, by registering and controlling the qualifications of installers, make it easier for a member of the public to identify a qualified person. It is hoped to complete the consultation process shortly with a view to having the proposed legislation enacted before the summer.</P>
        <P>The legislative proposals were published in November 2004 together with the CER&rsquo;s vision for a future safety framework. The closing date for receipt of written submissions was 7 January 2005 and a number of submissions has been received from interested parties. These submissions are being examined and discussions are taking place with a number of these parties with a view to clarifying the issues raised. Officials will meet BGE in this context later. It is hoped the proposed legislation as part of an energy miscellaneous provisions Bill will be enacted before the summer but this will be heavily dependent on availability of resources in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Oireachtas schedule.</P>

        <P>Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s catchphrase is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t You Deserve the Best&rdquo;. People in the north west deserve the best but the Minister for Transport has not sanctioned the building of a proper rail infrastructure in this region. I am disappointed he is not present for this debate because I have raised the issue of a direct train service between Dublin and Derry at many other fora and I have been forced to raise it on the Adjournment. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will ensure a copy of the transcript of the debate will be conveyed to the Minister for Transport and that he will seek a meeting with him on my behalf. I raised this issue previously with the Minister of State&rsquo;s aunt, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, when she was Minister for Public Enterprise and I thought I received a good hearing.</P>
        <P>This time last year there was a scare that the train service between Ballymena and Derry would be suspended. I was involved in whipping up support for retention of the service. While it has been retained, I do not know whether it will continue in the long term. Rail lines were dismantled everywhere in the 1960s whereas nowadays large amounts are being spent on new carriages and upgrading the network. It will be a scandal if a service is not provided between Dublin and Derry, even if part of the line is in another jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I can board a train in Derry, disembark in Belfast and board the Enterprise service to Dublin. There is no reason for the lack of a service between Dublin and Derry. Investment in Northern carriages and the upgrading of parts of the track are all that is needed to allow trains to travel quickly. It is possible to provide a direct service but there is no will to progress this issue.</P>
        <P>I was jealous of the announcements of the carriages but I am not being greedy. I have corresponded with the Minister for Transport, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Jonathan Spellar, Minister for Social Development, through the British-Ireland Interparliamentary Body, and they have indicated that I am being greedy. According to them, I should be happy with the bus service between Derry and Donegal. Derry is the fourth largest city on the island. Every other city is served by buses, trains and planes and, under the national development plan, they will be served by motorways. However, a motorway is not being provided for buses in the north west so we should, at the very least, be at the top of the queue for an alternative.</P>
        <P>I am accused of being greedy because I seek road, rail and air access but I am only seeking what every other region has had for years. I am worried about the lack of a North-South Ministerial Council and an executive to progress the matter and I am worried about the Secretary of <Col N="115" />State&rsquo;s response to my question at the sitting on the BIIPB on 19 October 2004. He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">My colleague, John Spellar, is studying the railway situation. The problem with all railways is that not enough people use them. It is a chicken and egg situation. Everybody wants to use the railways but not enough people wish to make them a viable proposition. The Belfast to Derry line goes through some of the most naturally beautiful scenic areas in Ireland and it is something we are examining until, I hope, eventually the Executive, will decide one way or the other.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If I wait for the executive to make a decision, I will be an old woman, given the current rate of progress. This is a cry of desperation on my behalf.</P>
        <P>This is one of the most beautiful routes. I chair the tourism committee and those who take the train on that line will discover one of the most beautiful locations on the island. However, I agree it is a chicken and egg situation. I and many others would avail of a direct train service. Roads have been upgraded and improved but a train service is not available. We spent money on getting the Dublin to Belfast line done. There is no reason then, if we go for European funding, that we cannot have a Dublin to Donegal service. It is not all right to say there are alternatives. All we want is equality. It is not an unfair request.</P>

        <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this important issue on the Adjournment. I was impressed with her eloquent plea for direct rail connection to Derry, which as she said is the fourth largest city in Ireland and one of significant sentimental importance to the people as a whole. I will certainly draw her comments to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on whose behalf I make this reply.</P>
        <P>The north-west region, the west Ulster region and Donegal specifically is served by a variety of public transport modes. The Minister has been informed that Bus &Eacute;ireann offers several services per day from Letterkenny, timetabled to take between three hours and 40 minutes and four hours and five minutes. The company expects <Col N="116" />journey times to improve over the coming years as road improvements are completed.</P>
        <P>The regional airline, Loganair, operates a twice-daily public service obligation air route between Dublin and Derry. The journey time is 50 minutes. Aer Arann, operating from Donegal Airport, also serves Dublin, offering a similar frequency and journey time. Deputy Keaveney referred to these rail and bus links in her contribution.</P>
        <P>Irish Rail and Translink offer the facility to travel by rail from Derry to Dublin, changing at Belfast, with a travelling time of approximately four hours 20 minutes. I understand from the Deputy that changing at Belfast is the crux of the issue she wishes the Minister to address. The waiting time for connections to Belfast Central Station can vary, but may add as little as 17 minutes, depending on the service used, to the total journey time.</P>
        <P>While journey times by rail are not as attractive as bus times, Irish Rail and Translink, the operator of the Northern Ireland Railway network, are working to improve journey times by rail. I understand that Translink is currently bringing into service a new fleet of diesel rail cars. With the additional capacity available as a result of the arrival of these new units, I expect Translink will examine all the options for the Derry-Belfast route and the scheduling thereon. It is Translink&rsquo;s decision, based on knowledge of the market and on consultation with its authorities and local interests to provide the levels and frequencies of rail services along the route that it believes are necessary and viable.</P>
        <P>A similar set of circumstances pertains to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s operations here. It has statutory responsibility for the scheduling and timetabling of trains. It is not for the Minister of the day to direct Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s day-to-day operations. The Minister of Transport has, however, asked Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to look at better marketing of the rail connection between Dublin and Derry in conjunction with Translink.</P>
        <P>I would not accuse the Deputy of greed in seeking to advance the cause of a direct Dublin-Derry train link. I wish her well in her endeavours.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 30 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>The NCCA proposals set out a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals envisage a re-structured senior cycle curriculum consisting of transition units, short courses and subjects. The option of a two or three year cycle would be retained and the leaving certificate applied programme would continue as a discrete programme. All pupils, including LCA pupils, would follow at least one transition unit and many pupils would take a greater number.</P>
        <P>The proposals provide also for an increased emphasis on a wider range of modes of assessment such as practical/portfolio/project work and continuous assessment, with assessment events spread out during courses of study and available at a number of points during the two or three year cycle.</P>
        <P>Initial advice on the reforms was submitted by the NCCA to my Department in June 2004, and it indicated that a further advice would be submitted early in 2005 setting out the configuration of subjects, short courses and options, and the assessment and implementation implications of the proposals. That second advice, which will <Col N="118" />enable the Department to assess the resource and operational implications of the proposals, has not yet been received.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, detailed costings of the resource implications of assessment have not yet been prepared in my Department. However, it is clear that the assessment proposals could incur considerable extra costs, given the proposals to assess subjects more frequently, to widen the scope for assessment of practical/project/portfolio work, to add national assessment for an extensive range of short courses, and to continue to provide largely for a centrally driven externally examined system.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the feedback in the consultation process on the future of senior cycle indicated that while the established leaving certificate is seen to attract high levels of public confidence, respondents overwhelmingly considered that the transition year, the LCA and the LCVP programmes offer greater relevance to the life experiences of learners, provide better for the development of personal and social skills and for a balance between academic and practical skills, and use more appropriate teaching and learning and assessment methods.</P>
        <P>These viewpoints need to be balanced against concerns regarding local assessment of the leaving certificate by class teachers and the fact that trends internationally in high stakes examinations are towards external assessment. There is also a high level of public belief and confidence that a centrally driven externally examined system suits the Irish context. The feasibility of any large-scale move towards more frequent continuous assessment for the leaving certificate must be considered in the light of these factors.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that the leaving certificate is an independent objective assessment which is highly regarded internationally. We must ensure that, as our education system continues to evolve in the knowledge society, reforms build on the existing strengths of the system while addressing its weaknesses. We need reforms that are designed to ensure that our system has integrity, relevance and quality for all our students, including those who are currently served well and those whose needs are not being as well met at present.</P>

        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsi<Col N="119" />bility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The budget which has been allocated to the National Educational Welfare Board for 2005 is &euro;7.8 million, an increase of &euro;1.3 million or 20% on the 2004 allocation. The percentage increase allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the education vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005.</P>
        <P>In November last my Department conveyed approval to the NEWB for the recruitment of a further ten educational welfare officers, bringing the authorised staffing from 84 to 94. These additional posts will enable the board to further rollout its services at local level around the country.</P>
        <P>I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB&rsquo;s staffing under review in the light of the rollout of services and any further proposals that the board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</P>

        <P>My Department has provided guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines, which issued in 1991, were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-<Col N="120" />free environment. The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
        <P>I have recently established a task force to consider and report on the issue of student behaviour in second level schools. The task force is chaired by Dr. Maeve Martin of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</P>
        <P>I want the work of this task force to provide a solid foundation for developing policies and best practice in our schools into the future. I expect that the task force will be linking closely to a wide range of interests across our education system on this very important issue.</P>
        <P>A consultative group is also to be formed, comprising all the partners in education and allowing for their input to the deliberations of the task force. In addition, I asked that the task force constitute fora of teachers, parents and students with a view to testing emerging ideas and proposals.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the task force are: to examine the issue of disruptive student behaviour as it impacts upon teaching and learning; to consider the effectiveness of strategies at present employed to address it; to advise on existing best practice, both nationally and internationally, in fostering positive student behaviour in schools and classrooms; and to make recommendations on how best to promote an improved climate for teaching and learning in classroom and schools.</P>
        <P>In recent days the task force has advertised in the national press inviting submissions from interested individuals and organisations.</P>
        <P>I have asked the task force to make recommendations by June 2005 and complete its work by the end of 2005. However, it may produce interim reports to highlight various issues of analysis and research.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The OECD review on the future of higher education in Ireland makes far reaching recommendations for reform and development of the sector. The extensive consultation undertaken by the <Col N="121" />OECD team with all the key stakeholders in the sector and their own undoubted expertise lend considerable weight to these recommendations.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that a number of the recommendations such as the designation of the institutes of technology within the proposed new tertiary education authority require legislative amendments, while others such as the structures required to maximise research output, require extensive consultation, not only with the agencies involved, but also with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Since my appointment, I have already met representatives from the universities and the institutes of technology and emphasised my commitment to progress the recommendations of the OECD.</P>
        <P>I am now initiating an intensive consultation process with stakeholders affected by the report with a view to developing a comprehensive response to the report and bringing proposals, including any necessary legislative proposals, to Government, when appropriate. Following on from the initial colloquium held last year by my predecessor, I have arranged to meet shortly representatives of my Department, the Higher Education Authority, the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities, the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology to begin a series of focused discussions on aspects of the report, and its implications for the development of a unified strategy for the future of the sector. I envisage that this will be the first in a series of meetings with interested parties which will ensure that their views are fully taken account of in developing the response to the report.</P>

        <P>I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multifaceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in <Col N="122" />the SPHE curriculum in the strand &ldquo;myself and others&rdquo; from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module on &ldquo;belonging and integrating&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its Guidelines on countering Bullying Behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department funds a number of support services which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>

        <P>The board of management/manager of a school, following consultation between the principal and the staff, determines the duties which need to be performed by the holders of posts of responsibility for the effective internal management of the school and the distribution of these duties between the posts having regard to the school&rsquo;s own priorities. Among the duties which have been identified as appropriate for assignment to holders of posts of responsibility in schools is that of first aid and safety officer.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has, through the education centre network approved and funded a number of first aid courses for teachers in the context of its summer course programme in 2004. That section also provides funding to education centres for the provision of courses to meet locally identified <Col N="123" />priority needs, which include first aid courses for teachers.</P>
        <P>Given the existing arrangements for the provision of first aid services in schools, it was not identified by the education partners as a specific issue for inclusion in the modernisation agenda for teachers in the context of payment of the benchmarking award.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>In relation to funding, primary schools are given an annual allocation of &euro;3,809 plus &euro;12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to school infrastructure. In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements. I am satisfied that the majority of schools are aware of their responsibilities in this area.</P>

        <P>The Government decided last July that my Department should finalise contractual negotiations with Jarvis Projects Limited with the view to commencing construction of the Cork School of Music as soon as practical. Shortly thereafter Jarvis plc, preferred bidder for the CSM project, announced a profit warning on the London Stock Exchange. To help solve its financial difficulties it is at present selling off non-core elements of the company. One of the areas to be disposed of is the PPP/PFI company.</P>
        <P>On 3 December 2004 it had reached an agreement with Hochtief Developments (UK) Ltd to purchase the Irish business interests of Jarvis. Following the announcement various issues surrounding the purchase were being completed and a revised proposal and documentation were received on 19 January. As Hochtief has now replaced Jarvis as a member of the bidding consortium it must satisfy the Department that had it applied under the terms of the original PPP <Col N="124" />advertised in 2000 it would have been one of the consortia that pre-qualified for the project. The new documentation is currently being examined by my Department&rsquo;s specialist advisers to the project who are also undertaking full financial and legal due diligence to ensure that the proposal meets all EU procurement rules.</P>
        <P>It is expected that this examination will be completed and a report submitted to my Department&rsquo;s public private partnership unit for consideration shortly.</P>
        <P>Subject to all necessary financial and legal issues being in order it will then be possible to commence formal negotiations with Hochtief Developments to complete the contract details to allow financial and commercial close for the project take place.</P>

        <P>There are a number of school building projects awaiting site resolution, including that of the school in question.

        <P>Under Action 43 of the National Drugs Strategy, guidelines for developing a substance abuse policy were drawn up by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the former health boards. These guidelines were issued to all schools in October 2002 to assist them in the development of appropriate substance abuse policies.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the guidelines is the responsibility of the relevant school authorities. However, the guidelines do not advise schools to <Col N="125" />undertake drug testing of pupils and I do not consider that the policy in this regard should be changed as there is no conclusive evidence that drug testing reduces the incidence of drug misuse among young people.</P>
        <P>I believe that alternative strategies, involving education, discussion, counselling, extra-curricular activities and the building of trust between students and adults need to be further developed.</P>

        <P>The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August 2003. The report indicates that of those pupils who commenced the junior cycle programme in September 1994, approximately 12,500, or 18.2%, left school without the leaving certificate. My Department is currently preparing reports on the 1995 and 1996 cohorts.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach to addressing the issue of early school leaving comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as preventative interventions.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The allocation for the NEWB in 2005 is &euro;7.8 million, an increase of &euro;1.3 million or 20% on the 2004 provision.</P>
        <P>With regard to curriculum reform, my Department&rsquo;s strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</P>
        <P>Following the publication in 2003 by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, of Directions for Development &mdash; Developing Senior Cycle Education, the NCCA has carried out further analyses and consultation in the lead-up to its presentation of advice and recommendations on the future of senior cycle. I look forward to consideration of the matter when I receive the next stage of the NCCA advice on the proposals shortly.</P>
        <P>The school completion programme directly targets those in danger of dropping out of the edu<Col N="126" />cation system and is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. Other programmes that contribute to tackling early school leaving include the home school community liaison scheme, which helps children to make the transition from primary to post-primary school.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising an overall review of educational disadvantage programmes. The purpose of this is to put in place a new action plan that will build on what has been achieved to date, adopt a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthen the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people.</P>
        <P>I am confident that all of these measures will significantly improve the numbers sitting the leaving certificate.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement reached with the religious congregations, the property contribution of the congregations is divided into two separate and distinct schedules of properties. One is a schedule of properties to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies or local authorities after the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be &euro;36.54 million. I can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with the religious congregations on the transfer of 35 properties to the amount of &euro;38.28 million. This figure of &euro;38.28 million includes &euro;4.98 million in cash that was provided by the congregations in lieu of property.</P>
        <P>The other schedule of properties includes: properties transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations between 11 May 1999 and the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be &euro;40.32 million. I can confirm that, at this stage, transfers of 27 proper<Col N="127" />ties to the value of approximately &euro;32.93 million have been agreed in principle.</P>
        <P>The process of agreeing valuations on each individual property is continuing and my Department has written to CORI suggesting that it considers the payment of a cash contribution to cover any shortfall that may arise in the value of property transferred to finalise that part of the agreement. Further discussions are taking place with CORI on this matter.</P>
        <P>While arrangements for the legal transfer of properties are the responsibility of the individual transferees, my Department will continue to liaise with the various transferees to ensure that all properties on which agreement in principle has been reached are legally transferred.</P>
        <P>Estimating the final cost of the redress scheme remains problematic at this stage and it will not be until the redress board has completed its work that the final cost will be known. The scheme has been operating for approximately two years now and the redress board will continue to accept applications until December 2005. As it will take some considerable time to deal with all applications, the final outturn may not be known until sometime in 2007. The latest available estimate to my Department on the total cost of awards under the scheme, allowing for legal costs, is in the region of &euro;610 million to &euro;650 million, but this is a tentative estimate that may need to be revised in the light of applications received over the remainder of this year.</P>
        <P>I should add that the final cost of the redress scheme must be viewed in the light of the very substantial costs that would have been incurred in any event if no such scheme had been established and if cases had been processed in the normal manner through the courts.</P>

        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish an agency whose function, in the first instance, is to prepare a strategic planning scheme for the Grangegorman site. The plan must provide for the needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Health Service Executive, the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children. The Bill provides for wide-ranging consultation with all the parties who may have an involvement in the site. This ranges from those who are directly concerned &mdash; local residents, DIT and the Dublin City Council &mdash; to those parties whose future involvement may have a bearing on the site reaching its full potential such as the IDA and Dublin Bus.</P>

        <P>Schools catering for non-national pupils who have significant English language deficits are entitled to assistance to enable these pupils gain full access to the curriculum.</P>
        <P>Schools that have 14 to 27 non-English speaking non-national pupils enrolled are entitled to a full-time temporary language support teaching post at primary level and a whole-time equivalent teaching post at post-primary level. Schools with 28 or more such pupils are entitled to two full-time temporary-whole-time equivalent language support posts.</P>
        <P>Where there are between three and 13 non-national pupils enrolled in a primary school, the board of management may apply to the primary administration section of my Department for a grant to enable the school to take measures to improve the standard of English of the pupils concerned. Schools with between three and eight such pupils receive grant assistance in the amount of &euro;6,348.69 while schools with between nine and 13 pupils receive grant assistance in the amount of &euro;9,523.04. The total amount expended on such grants in the 2003-04 school year exceeded &euro;2.3 million.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, where there are fewer than 14 pupils, additional teaching hours ranging from three hours per week for one pupil to 19.5 hours per week for 13 pupils are allocated. The support for an individual pupil is provided for a period of up to two years.</P>
        <Col N="130" />
        <P>In the current school year 393 language support teacher posts have been sanctioned at primary level and 202.78 wholetime equivalent teaching posts have been allocated to post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a start-up grant of &euro;635 when a language support teacher is allocated to a school. A follow-up grant of &euro;318 issues annually to each school for which the language support teacher continues to be sanctioned. The purpose of the grant is to facilitate the purchase of appropriate educational material and resources for use by the teacher.</P>
        <P>In addition, Integrate Ireland Language and Training, IILT, formerly known as the Refugee Language Support Unit, a company of Trinity College, is funded by my Department to provide training for English language support teachers and their principals.

        <P>Reading literacy achievement in primary schools is measured using standardised reading tests. Children&rsquo;s achievement scores on these tests are expressed in percentiles from one to 99. Those who score at or below the tenth percentile are generally regarded as having serious literacy difficulties and would be given additional supports in school, such as learning support teaching. This is a rather arbitrary estimate, as by definition, 10% of children must be at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test.</P>
        <P>There are no reliable estimates or definitions of what constitutes a moderate literacy difficulty at primary level. At second level, the programme for international student achievement, PISA, survey of 15 year olds conducted in 2000 categorised achievement at five levels of proficiency. Those who had the lowest level of literacy achievement were categorised as &ldquo;below level 1&rdquo;. In Ireland, only 3.1% of children were in this category, well below the OECD average of 6%, while 7.9% of <Col N="132" />Irish students scored at level 1, compared to an OECD average of 11.9%. Strictly speaking, one cannot extrapolate the findings of the PISA study to primary school children, but PISA represents the best illustration available of the distribution of literacy achievement in the school system.</P>
        <P>I believe that literacy achievement is fundamental to a sound education and I will continue to give high priority to maintaining and improving literacy standards.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the recently announced 2005 school building programme provides details of 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005 is just the first phase of the school building programme.</P>
        <P>Last December I outlined a new approach to the rollout of the multi-annual building programme with key changes based on the experience of the previous year, when a number of projects included in the 2004 school building programme encountered difficulties and were delayed in going to construction by some months.</P>
        <P>This year the school authorities were immediately contacted by officials from the planning and building unit of my Department and invited to attend briefing sessions, which have already taken place. The purpose of the briefing sessions is to engage with the school authorities and to outline the steps which they must take to ensure that the projects make appropriate progress in the tender process to provide a continuous flow of projects to construction over the coming months.</P>
        <P>This announcement is the first in a series of announcements I plan to make in the coming period on the schools building and modernisation programme that will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships; an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding; details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme; schools whose projects will further progress through the design process; and schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>
        <P>The allocation of &euro;270 million to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools represents an increase of 14% on last year.</P>

        <P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide an intensive service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID <Col N="135" />programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
        <P>During the summer of 2004, the board undertook a survey on the levels of school attendance for the school year 2003-04. This is the first time that data on school attendance at national level have been collected. The findings of the survey support the targeting policy followed by the board to date in appointing educational welfare officers to the areas of greatest disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Schools are required to refer students to the board who have been absent for over 20 days cumulatively during the school year, or where a school principal wishes to express concern about the attendance pattern of a particular student. Staff of the NEWB make contact with the school to establish reasons for the absences, and what steps have been taken to date by the school to improve the child&rsquo;s attendance. An educational welfare officer may then contact the parent in question to advise and support the parent regarding the need for the child to attend school regularly. In RAPID designated areas, EWOs offer an intensive service to schools and parents. Outside these designated areas, the NEWB offers an urgent service where cases of chronic absenteeism are followed up in consultation with schools.</P>
        <P>In response to a request from the board my Department approved the recruitment of an additional ten staff in November 2004 to meet identified needs. The appointment of ten extra staff to counties which up to now have not had the benefit of the presence of an EWO will enable the NEWB to extend the intensive service.</P>
        <P>The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and a number of assessments have now taken place. The Department issued guidelines in 2003 to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in this area. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment.</P>
        <P>Guidelines were issued by the NEWB last month to all primary and post-primary schools on reporting student absences. The guidelines provide step-by-step advice on how and when school attendance returns should be made and how the new website, <i>www.schoolreturn.ie</i>, can be used by schools to comply with their legal obligations to report student absences to the board.</P>
        <P>The budget which has been allocated to the National Educational Welfare Board for 2005 is &euro;7.8 million, an increase of &euro;1.3 million or 20% on the 2004 allocation. The percentage increase allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the education Vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005.</P>

        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</P>
        <P>Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 to 29.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to the available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The timing and manner in which the target set out in the programme for Government can be met is being examined by my Department in consultation with the education partners. Additional posts will continue to be provided. The deployment of these posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>
        <P>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual school is a matter for the board of management of the school concerned. Boards of management must make every effort, including advertising in a national newspaper, to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for appointment to a temporary or permanent post.</P>

        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>An amount of &euro;671 million has been allocated to the university sector for 2005. This is an increase of over &euro;40 million or approximately 6.5% on the 2004 provision for the sector. The overall funding, capital and current, for the third level sector which I secured in the 2005 Estimates will stand at some &euro;1.58 billion. The additional funding being provided in 2005 marks a return to the significant upward trend in recurrent funding for the sector and will assist in meeting pay and other cost pressures. I have no plans to provide further additional funding to the sector this year.</P>
        <P>The OECD review of Irish higher education highlighted the key role of the sector for our future social and economic development. This echoes the report of the Government enterprise strategy group, which states that Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, and the social dividends that flow from that, will depend to a large degree on knowledge and innovation. Supporting our higher education institutions in playing that central role is a major policy priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The OECD report also identifies the need to align funding allocations with the achievement of national and sectoral objectives. I support that principle. A number of institutions are embarking on far-reaching programmes of internal restructuring and reform. Some are further down that road than others. These efforts are crucial to ensuring that, collectively, we can develop the capacity to meet the wider challenges that we face. I want to ensure that funding allocation decisions for the coming years will support and promote our wider strategic objectives.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will also note that I announced a 35% increase in research funding as part of the 2005 Estimates. This is evidence of my personal, and indeed the Government&rsquo;s, commitment to research programmes, which play a vital role in developing world-class capabilities in research and innovation and give the higher education institutions the necessary resources to meet the challenges of the knowledge society in Ireland.</P>

        <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available at present.</P>
        <P>However, the National Economic and Social Forum report of 2002 on early school leaving cited, as a broad estimate, that around 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-pri<Col N="138" />mary on an annual basis. There is some doubt attached to this estimated figure of 1,000, which may be an over-statement of the true position at this stage.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently completing analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database, which will facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a number of programmes at both primary and post-primary level to tackle the problem of early school leaving.</P>
        <P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
        <P>A key role in this regard is also played by the home-school-community liaison, HSCL, scheme, which was extended to each of the 312 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also addresses issues in the community impinging on learning and educational participation.</P>
        <P>The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects &mdash; 300 primary and 112 post-primary schools &mdash; parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Some &euro;24 million has been allocated to the programme in 2005.</P>
        <P>Both the HSCL scheme and all 82 school completion programme projects operate transfer programmes which are very important in assisting pupils in making the transition from primary to post-primary level.</P>
        <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provide a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools.</P>
        <P>Additional funding provided in 2005 to alleviate disadvantage will support the further development of measures to address early school leaving.</P>

        <P>On 6 December last the Higher Education Authority published a national action plan 2005-06 for achieving equity of access to higher education. This plan was developed by the national office of the HEA, with the assistance of an advisory group representative of learners, education partners and social partners, as well as through a process of broader consultation.</P>
        <?oasys _ic14-?>
        <P>The action plan identifies key goals and action points over the next three years to achieve equity of access to higher education for groups currently under-represented in the sector, such as persons with a disability, socio-economically disadvantaged school-leavers, mature students and members of the travelling community and ethnic minority groups.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?>
        <P>A priority area for action in the plan is evaluation of access programmes which have been established in higher education institutions to ascertain what strategies and partnerships work best in achieving equity of access to higher education. Building upon this work, the national office will develop and support the implementation of a national framework of access policies and initiatives for each of the above target groups. This will include arrangements so that all disadvantaged regions, schools and communities are linked to access activities and programmes in at least one higher education institution in their region.</P>
        <P>Quantitative and qualitative targets and indicators of progress for access programmes and activities in higher education institutions will also be developed and agreed with stakeholders so that the basis on which financial resources are allocated is clear and coherent. These indicators will also enable effective evaluation and monitoring of progress.</P>

        <P>The proposed new system of teacher allocation involves a general allocation to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. This approach to allocating resources for special edu<Col N="140" />cational needs is substantively in line with current thinking in many European countries. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.</P>
        <P>I should emphasise that individual applications may continue to be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the proposed model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I am having the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive a level of service appropriate to their needs. The review involves consultation with representative interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented in the next school year. Circular SP ED 09/04 will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

        <P>There are multiple factors which contribute to differential performance between males and females in examinations. These include teaching and learning approaches, school culture and classroom organisation, teacher expectations, student attitudes and behaviour, later maturation of boys, parental expectations, decisions regarding subject choice and levels of courses along with the format and style of questioning in the examinations. In particular, it is evident that more boys than girls are entered for foundation and ordinary levels of the junior certificate and this is likely to impact on performance and choice in senior cycle. The patterns of differences in performance of boys and girls in the leaving certificate examinations reflect those found in education systems internationally.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has published a research report entitled Examining Gender &mdash; Gender and Achievement in the Junior and Leaving Certificate Examination Systems 2000/2001 in June 2003. The report claims that tiered entry systems, for example, foundation, ordinary and higher levels, can significantly interact with gender, and it points to international evidence that more boys than girls tend to be entered on lower levels courses. The study examined such issues as the <Col N="141" />syllabus content, the selection of content for assessment and the format of examination papers for junior and leaving certificate English and mathematics, junior certificate science and leaving certificate physics. None of the syllabi or areas of content chosen was seen to give undue advantage to either sex.</P>
        <P>Communicative styles which are narrative, discursive, involve the use of own experience, imaginative and personal processes, or collaborative based approaches, along with subjects which involve a high degree of recall were found to favour girls who tend to be better organised and better prepared. Communicative approaches which are concise, deductive, functional, argumentative and non-collaborative were found to favour boys, with males coping better with novel or unfamiliar items.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Economic and Social Research Institute is carrying out extensive longitudinal research for the NCCA on the progress of a cohort of students as they make the transition from primary to second level and progress through junior cycle. This is providing important information on the factors which are considered to have significant influence on student performance such as pupil and teacher expectations and school practice in the content of curriculum on offer to students. Feedback from the study is being disseminated to schools by the NCCA and the initial report, Moving Up &mdash; The Experiences of First Year Students in Post Primary Education, was published in 2004.</P>
        <P>These issues raised in the above mentioned ongoing research are being considered by the NCCA as part of its programme of ongoing curricular review, and in the context of the proposals for reform of the senior cycle. The State Examinations Commission is also considering the research outcomes that are applicable to the running of the certificate examinations. My Department is committed to providing the highest possible educational opportunities for boys and girls alike and to meeting their differing needs to the fullest extent.</P>
        <P>In terms of international studies, the OECD PISA 2003 results set out the performance of 15 year olds across 40 countries in the domains of mathematics, reading literacy, science literacy and problem solving. The study found that females have significantly higher average performance in reading in all countries except Liechtenstein, with an average OECD gender gap of 34 score points. In science, the OECD average difference was six score points in favour of males. In mathematics, while overall the gender gaps are small, Iceland was the only OECD country where females consistently perform better than males.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 49 together.</P>
        <P>I have made no decision on the systematisation of testing in primary schools. In response to a request from my predecessor, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently preparing advice on issues relating to standardised testing for pupils during their compulsory schooling. It is my intention to defer decisions until I am fully informed regarding the potential and the limitations of standardised testing and until I have explored the range of options available. The advice of the NCCA, which I expect to receive before Easter, will help to shape my thinking. I understand that the formulation of the NCCA advice is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>My approach will be to weigh the benefits to pupils, parents, schools and the system against the costs in terms of the inputs required and the consequences that are likely to result. This will involve consultation as well as intensive listening and reflection on my part.</P>
        <P>I believe that there is widespread acceptance of the value of standardised tests, as one of a range of modes of assessment, to help teachers make more informed decisions in relation to the instruction of pupils, to inform parents of pupils&rsquo; progress and to provide information relevant to the identification of pupils that may require additional support.</P>
        <P>The fact that more than 95% of our primary schools use standardised tests is testimony to the value that our teachers ascribe to them. In the light of this, it seems desirable that all pupils, and their parents, would have the same entitlement to avail of standardised tests and to derive the benefit of the judicious use of their results.</P>
        <P>In addition, tests can provide valuable information for teachers, principals and boards of management when engaging in a self-evaluation process. There is also a clear need to develop systems that will provide my Department with more regular information regarding pupils&rsquo; progress and the standards they are achieving.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the benefits of standardised testing that I have just outlined, I can understand how any move to systematise their use can give rise to fears and concerns. At this stage I can give my assurance that there will be no question of requiring all pupils in certain classes to take a standardised test on one day. I can also say that it is not my Department&rsquo;s intention to use the results of standardised tests as a stand-alone criterion to determine the allocation of resources to individual pupils and individual schools or as a stand-alone criterion to measure the effectiveness of individual teachers and schools or to compile school league tables.</P>

        <P>Rather, the intention is to develop a considered and balanced policy in relation to standardised testing. I believe that it should contribute to the current information deficit in relation to the quality of the education system and also support teachers, parents and schools in their efforts to make pupils&rsquo; learning experiences as fruitful and as beneficial to their individual needs as possible.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 183 together.</P>
        <P>An overall review of educational disadvantage programmes is currently being finalised by my Department. The purpose of this is to put in place a new action plan which will build on what has been achieved to date, adopt a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthen the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people.</P>
        <P>My priorities for tackling educational disadvantage in the context of the new action plan, will include putting in place a more structured system for identifying and regularly reviewing levels of disadvantage and targeting supports accordingly; placing a strong emphasis on early intervention; tackling problems in literacy, numeracy and early school leaving; strengthening administrative, planning and professional development supports for schools serving disadvantaged communities; adopting a more integrated approach to delivery of supports both within the education sector and on a cross-sectoral basis; increasing partnership between schools, homes and the wider community, including the business community; and strengthened arrangements in regard to research and measurement of progress and outcomes from educational inclusion measures.</P>
        <P>My Department provided some &euro;540 million in 2004 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage in accordance with the strategies outlined in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and Sustaining Progress. Very significant additional funding is being provided to alleviate disadvantage in 2005. This additional funding will allow for targeting of measures from pre-school through the <Col N="144" />school system to third-level, second-chance education and adult literacy.</P>

        <P>The payment of teacher salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee-charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.</P>
        <P>There are 58 fee-charging second level schools in the country; of which one is Jewish, 21 Protestant, two inter-denominational and the balance Catholic. The Protestant and Jewish schools receive funding by way of a block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion to attend schools which reflect their denominational ethos. The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee-charging schools not embraced by the block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.</P>
        <P>Financial support provided to fee-charging voluntary secondary schools in 2003-04 school year amounted to some &euro;86 million. Of this sum, some 90%, or &euro;78 million, related to salaries and allowances of teachers. The balance includes the Protestant block grant, funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services and miscellaneous grants.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee-charging schools. This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</P>

        <P>The NCCA proposals set out a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals envisage a re-structured senior cycle curriculum consisting of transition units, short courses and subjects. The option of a two or three year cycle would be retained and the leaving certificate applied programme would continue as a discrete programme. All pupils, including LCA pupils, would follow at least one transition unit and many pupils would take a greater number.</P>
        <P>The proposals provide also for an increased emphasis on a wider range of modes of assessment such as practical-portfolio-project work and continuous assessment, with assessment events spread out during courses of study and available at a number of points during the two or three year cycle.</P>
        <P>Initial advice on the reforms was submitted by the NCCA to my Department in June 2004, and it indicated that a further advice would be submitted early in 2005 setting out the configuration of subjects, short courses and options, and the assessment and implementation implications of the proposals. That second advice, which will enable the Department to assess the resource and operational implications of the proposals, has not yet been received.</P>

        <P>The proposed new system of teacher allocation involves a general allocation to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence SEN, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.</P>
        <P>I should emphasise that individual applications may continue to be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence SEN.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the proposed model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I am having the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive a level of service appropriate to their needs. The review will involve consultation with representative interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented in the next school year.</P>

        <Quest>the progress made on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on autism; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>At the outset, I want to say that the recommendations of the task force in question provide a valuable basis for the development of educational services and supports for persons with autism. However, in responding to the recommendations, my Department has had to give priority to a number of key areas before detailed individual recommendations can be addressed. These key areas involve the implementation of the core legislative and structural measures required to underpin service develop<Col N="147" />ment and delivery. This approach is critical to the implementation of many of the individual recommendations of the task force.</P>
        <P>With regard to legislation, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has now been enacted while, on the structural front, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established on a statutory basis. While these developments represent significant progress, a considerable amount of additional input is required before these measures can begin to have a positive impact on services for children with special educational needs, SEN, including those with autism.</P>
        <P>Over the course of the coming months, I expect that significant progress will be made in this regard. Specifically, consideration will be given to the detailed measures required to enable the Act to be commenced. In that regard I wish to inform the Deputy that the NCSE has now assumed operational status.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the establishment of the NCSE will greatly enhance the provision of services to children with SEN, including those with autism and result in a timely response to schools who have made application for SEN supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council&rsquo;s operation will be the responsibility of special educational needs organisers, SENOs. Up to 70 SENOs have been employed, all of whom have a qualification and previous work experience relating to service delivery to children with disabilities. The SENOs will be responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating delivery of educational services to children with disabilities at local level. In particular, the SENOs will be a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools, and will process applications for resources for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. This will also involve regular and detailed engagement with organisations such as health authorities, the Department, including administrative divisions, the inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to develop the network of special educational provision for children with autism. The extent of progress can be measured from the fact that, since 1998, when autism was first recognised as a distinct special educational need, the number of dedicated facilities that have been developed include nine pre-school classes for children with autism; 140 special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools; five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome; and eight autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model, ABA, of response to children with autism Another major landmark in the development of autism specific services was the joint launch last month by my predecessor and the Minister with responsibility for Education in Northern Ireland of the Middletown Centre for Autism. This <Col N="148" />marked the successful completion of the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown on behalf of the Department of Education in the North and the Department of Education and Science in the South. Both Departments plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders.</P>
        <P>Four key services will be provided by the centre: a learning support service, on a residential basis; an educational assessment service; a training and advisory service; and an autism research and information service.</P>
        <P>I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of services for children with autism. However, I fully recognise that further progress is required and my Department in consultation with parents and existing service providers will seek to ensure that the recent rate of development is maintained.</P>
        <P>I will continue to address many of the recommendations of the task force in consultation with the council and other interested parties.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 58 together.</P>
        <Col N="149" />
        <P>The central vetting unit run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for vetting requests in relation to prospective employees of designated agencies who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The designated agencies comprise over 900 organisations. In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children detention schools as well as special needs assistants and bus escorts to children with special needs. The vetting unit would have information on the numbers being vetted.</P>
        <P>A cross-governmental working group, established to put forward proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit, has recommended the expansion of its services to include all people working with children and vulnerable adults. To this end, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a major increase in the resources to be provided to the Garda vetting unit to improve the level of vetting available to employers who employ people to work with children and vulnerable adults. The initiative includes the more than doubling of staff resources for the unit. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has appointed an implementation committee to give effect to the group&rsquo;s recommendations. The introduction of legislation to ensure the maintenance of a national criminal records system within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being examined in this context.</P>
        <P>In the context of non-Garda vetting, relating to employment history rather than criminal records, the working group also recommended that the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children explore the possibility of developing an employment history register, similar to the PECS system in Northern Ireland. The two Departments are in contact on this issue.</P>
        <P>The teaching council also has a role here. When it is established, the council will provide the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, with the means to self-regulate and its functions will include maintaining a register of teachers and if necessary removing the names of those shown to be unfit to teach, including those unfit to teach by reason of the fact that they pose a threat to children.</P>

        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s policy that, in as far as is possible, Traveller children should participate in mainstream education in age-appropriate classes and in an integrated setting.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that this policy translates into practice, my Department provides a range of supports. A total of 519 resource teacher posts have been sanctioned in primary schools. A resource teacher post is sanctioned where schools have a minimum enrolment of 14 Traveller pupils. Additional teaching hours are sanctioned in respect of Traveller children enrolled in post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>My Department employs a national education officer for Travellers and funds a visiting teacher service for Travellers. There are currently 40 teacher posts in the visiting teachers service and they provide advice and support to schools and to Traveller families. While the visiting teacher service is available to all Traveller children, a precise figure on the number of Traveller children who access this service is not available.</P>
        <P>A major focus of the work of the visiting teacher service is encouraging greater participation in education by Traveller children both in terms of achieving regular attendance and of retention in full-time education.</P>

        <P>My Department has provided guidelines to boards of management to assist them in <Col N="154" />discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines, which issued in 1991, were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
        <P>I recently established a task force to consider and report on the issue of student behaviour in second level schools. The task force is chaired by Dr. Maeve Martin of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</P>
        <P>I want the work of this task force to provide a solid foundation for developing policies and best practice in our schools into the future. I expect that the task force will link closely to a wide range of interests across our education system on this very important issue.</P>
        <P>A consultative group will also be formed, comprising all the partners in education and allowing for their input to the deliberations of the task force. In addition, I asked that the task force would constitute fora of teachers, parents and students with a view to testing emerging ideas and proposals.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the task force are to examine the issue of disruptive student behaviour as it impacts upon teaching and learning; to consider the effectiveness of strategies at present employed to address it; to advise on existing best practice, both nationally and internationally, in fostering positive student behaviour in schools and classrooms; and to make recommendations on how best to promote an improved climate for teaching and learning in classroom and schools.</P>
        <P>In recent days the task force has advertised in the national press inviting submissions from interested individuals and organisations.</P>
        <P>I have asked the task force to make recommendations by June 2005 and complete its work by the end of 2005. However, it may produce interim reports to highlight various issues of analysis and research.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy can see, the matter is being comprehensively addressed in a way which will take into account the concerns of teachers, parents and students themselves. I am confident therefore that the question of industrial action will not arise in this context.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
        <P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs, receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
        <P>Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes-units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many children with such needs are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of special resource teachers and-or special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are 107 special schools in the country at present. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant support is pro<Col N="156" />vided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>Where placement in a special school is not considered necessary, children with special educational needs can attend special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools. All special classes enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with special educational needs attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and, in that way, benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers.</P>
        <P>While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>The following dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs in the primary system: more than 2,600 resource teachers &mdash; up from 104 in 1998; more than 1,500 learning support teachers &mdash; up from 1,302 in 1998; more than 1,000 teachers in special schools; more than 600 teachers in special classes; more than 5,000 special needs assistants &mdash; up from 300 in 1998; more than &euro;30 million on school transport for special needs pupils; and more than &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials &mdash; up from &euro;0.8million in 1998.</P>
        <P>To appreciate the scale of improvement in the provision of resources to primary schools for special needs, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, at approximately 10,700, the number of adults providing services to children with special educational needs in primary schools today equates to more than half of the 21,100 primary teaching force in 1998.</P>
        <P>The level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs in the second level system has also grown significantly in recent years. In the current school year to date, my Department has allocated approximately 1,386 whole-time equivalent teachers and approximately 626 special needs assistants to second level schools and VECs to cater for the special educational needs of students at second level. This represents an increase of approximately 280 resource teacher posts and approximately 160 special needs assistant posts on the previous school year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005 the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs and in particular it is responsible for the following: deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational <Col N="157" />needs at second level; and deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources at primary and post-primary level and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a circular and letter advising the authorities of primary and post-primary schools, respectively, of the arrangements put in place as a result of the transfer of these functions to the NCSE.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach to the increasing diversity of Irish society, as reflected in the school population, has been, and continues to be, an intercultural approach, promoting mutual respect, dialogue and collaboration within the whole school community, and promoting anti-racism as an integral part of this approach.</P>
        <P>The new curricula at primary and post-primary levels provide ample opportunity to extend students&rsquo; awareness of the wider world and to learn about the lives and histories of people in other countries, and of their contributions to art and science.</P>
        <P>In addition to the whole school intercultural approach, my Department has been providing resources to support English language acquisition by non-national children who have needs in this area and who are enrolled in primary and post-primary schools. The aim of language support is to ensure that each child has sufficient language skills not only to benefit from but also to contribute to the educational activities taking place in the school.</P>
        <P>The social, personal and health education programmes at primary and post-primary levels, are designed to prepare students for participatory citizenship and to develop the skills of critical appraisal and decision-making based on human rights and social responsibilities. They also promote a respect for human dignity, tolerance for <Col N="158" />the values and beliefs of others, and a celebration of diversity. Their format allows scope for teachers to deal with issues such as gender equity, racism and xenophobia, interculturalism and development education. In addition, many schools address the issue of racism in their religious education programmes.</P>
        <P>A range of additional resources and information materials have been made available for schools including videos, resource packs and guidelines for teachers. In addition, following a national consultation process, a report on anti-racism and interculturalism in the education sector has been made available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. Actions in this area are supplemented by working groups, research reports, and seminars organised by various educational interests, including the management bodies and teacher unions.</P>
        <P>My Department is supporting the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in producing guidelines on intercultural education and the curriculum for schools and teachers. These guidelines aim to mainstream intercultural education across all aspects of the curriculum, discussing diversity within Irish society, racism in attitude and practice and providing practical examples of how to develop an intercultural perspective across each area of the curriculum. The publication of the guidelines should ensure an increase in awareness of the issues around our multi-ethnic society and make a significant contribution to intercultural and anti-racist education in first and second level schools throughout the country. The design company is currently working on both the Irish and English versions for completion in April. Dissemination to every school will follow thereafter.</P>

        <Col N="160" />
        <P>The OECD review on the future of higher education in Ireland makes far reaching recommendations for reform and development of the sector. The extensive consultation undertaken by the OECD team with all the key stakeholders in the sector, and its own undoubted expertise, lend considerable weight to these recommendations.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that a number of the recommendations such as the designation of the institutes of technology within the proposed new tertiary education authority require legislative amendments, while others such as the structures required to maximise research output, require extensive consultation, not only with the agencies involved but also with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment, I have already met representatives from the universities and the institutes of technology, and emphasised my commitment to progress the recommendations of the OECD. I am now initiating an extensive consultative process with stakeholders affected by the report with a view to developing a comprehensive response to the report and bringing proposals, including any necessary legislative proposals, to Government when appropriate. Following on from the initial colloquium held last year by my predecessor, I have arranged to meet shortly representatives of my Department, the Higher Education Authority, the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities, the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology to begin a series of focused discussions on aspects of the report and its implications for the development of a unified strategy for the future of the sector.

        <P>The report referred to relates to the second cycle of the OECD programme for international student assessment, PISA 2003, which was administered in 30 OECD member countries, including Ireland, and in 11 non-OECD, partner, countries in spring-autumn 2003.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, 3880 15 year olds in 145 post-primary schools participated in PISA 2003. Tests in one major assessment domain, mathematics, and in three minor domains, reading literacy, science, and cross-curricular problem solving, were administered. As mathematics was the major <Col N="161" />domain, four separate content areas, sub-domains, were assessed. This means that, in addition to the combined, or overall, mathematics scores for each country, its performance on four separate subscales in mathematics is also available.</P>
        <P>Ireland ranked 17th of 29 OECD countries on combined, overall, mathematics. The results for the United Kingdom were not included as response rates were too low. Our mean score was not significantly different from the OECD mean, indicating average levels of performance in mathematics overall. However, the closer analysis that is afforded by the subscales shows that students in Ireland achieved scores that were significantly higher than the corresponding OECD mean score in two mathematics sub-domains, uncertainty and change and relationships, at the OECD average in one, quantity, and below the OECD average in one, space and shape. These results give a fuller picture of our students&rsquo; performance and point to strengths that are not obvious from the data on overall scores alone. A noteworthy aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s performance when compared with OECD countries is that fewer students performed at the lowest proficiency levels, level 1 or below, 16.8%, as against the OECD mean of 21.4%. This provides evidence of comparatively good standards among low achievers.</P>
        <P>Caution must be exercised in using the results of PISA 2003 to judge the impact of the revised junior certificate mathematics syllabus that was first examined in June 2003. Account must be taken of the following factors: PISA does not aim to provide a direct measure of students&rsquo; mastery of specific curricular content, instead it sets out to measure content and learning processes that are deemed important for life; important elements of the junior certificate mathematics syllabus are not assessed by PISA, for example, sets, geometry and trigonometry; and only 59.6% of students who participated in PISA 2003 took the junior certificate examination in 2003 and, therefore, followed the revised syllabus; the 34.3% who took the examination in 2002 followed the previous syllabus.</P>
        <P>It is important to be aware that the recent revision of junior certificate mathematics was a minor update of the previous syllabus, carried out to deal with areas of the course that were giving rise to difficulties. The focus of the accompanying in-career development programme was on moving the emphasis in teaching from mechanistic approaches towards teaching for understanding, a change which is consonant with the philosophy that underpins PISA. While totals of 4,940 and 3,663 teachers of mathematics attended cluster-based and school-based in-service, respectively, in the four years up to June 2004, it would be premature to expect that the positive effects of these interventions would be evident from the results of PISA 2003.</P>
        <P>The ongoing analysis of the PISA 2003 will inform my Department&rsquo;s policy in regard to <Col N="162" />mathematics in the post-primary curriculum. In particular, it will complement the review of post-primary mathematics which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will carry out in 2005 at my Department&rsquo;s request.</P>

        <P>The teacher induction pilot project, which commenced in September 2002, has been developed by my Department in conjunction with <Col N="163" />the standing committee of teacher unions and university education departments. The general aim of the project is to develop proposals for an effective programme of induction for newly qualified teachers at primary and post-primary levels tailored to their particular professional development needs and sensitive to the strengths, requirements and challenges of the Irish education system. Divided into two components for primary and post-primary levels, the overall project has been managed by a representative steering committee.</P>
        <P>The initial year of the pilot, phase I, comprised an action research phase, during which an in-depth investigation and analysis of the needs of newly qualified teachers was conducted. This work systematically documented the needs of newly qualified teachers, identifying the most effective means of meeting these needs and making recommendations for a comprehensive policy on induction. The extension of the pilot in the 2003-04 academic year, phase II of the pilot, facilitated further research into the needs of newly-qualified teachers while exploring the effectiveness of a range of induction models in a variety of teaching contexts using newly qualified teachers from St. Patrick&rsquo;s College and University College Dublin. Phase II also allowed for a regional expansion of the project through the education centre network beyond the Dublin region.</P>
        <P>Phases I and II of the project can be regarded as having facilitated the building of capacity within the system in regard to newly qualified teachers. This work has culminated in the recent completion of a report on the progress achieved by the pilot project. This report, which, I understand, is currently at final draft stage, incorporates the findings of the research phase and contains recommendations regarding the development and implementation of a national programme of support for new qualified teachers at primary and post-primary levels. I am informed that the implementation strategy contained in the draft report incorporates the key elements of best practice in induction and mentoring identified in the pilot phases of the pilot project and from studies in international practice and research.</P>
        <P>In order to maintain the impetus built-up during phases I and II, it was decided to initiate a phase III of the project for the 2004-05 year while the draft report was in progress. This phase consolidates the work undertaken to date and harnesses the experience gained in phases I and II. Additional colleges of education and education centres have become involved in the project which has also been nuanced to cover different types of schools such as small rural primary schools, those located in disadvantaged areas and schools dealing with issues of special education, social inclusion and other relevant matters from teaching and learning. The development of phase III presents additional opportunities to develop <Col N="164" />induction and mentoring resource material, assessment and evaluation procedures, develop capacity within the system within the overall context of further investigating the practical implications and resourcing of a national programme.</P>
        <P>I understand that the steering committee of the national pilot project in teacher induction is currently finalising the draft report containing specific and comprehensive recommendations regarding the implementation of a national programme and a timescale for its introduction. Once completed, the report will be presented to me for consideration within the continuum from initial pre-entry education through induction to post- entry continuing professional development over a teacher&rsquo;s career.</P>

        <P>My Department is aware of findings of the recent INTO survey to which the Deputy refers. The findings are broadly similar to the data which the National Educational Welfare Board compiled from the returns made to it by schools for the 2003-04 school year. This was the first occasion on which comprehensive national data were assembled from schools relating to school attendance.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, one of the functions of the board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. The board is in the process of establishing two research projects in 2005, one of which will focus on an analysis of student absenteeism returns. I look forward to receiving the report from this analysis in due course from the board.</P>
        <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents and guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, are <Col N="165" />being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The budget which has been allocated to the National Educational Welfare Board for 2005 is &euro;7.8 million, an increase of &euro;1.3 million or 20% on the 2004 allocation. The percentage increase allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the education vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005.</P>
        <P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Some five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. A total of 13 towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
        <P>Analysis of the returns made to the board by schools on levels of attendance for the school year 2003-04 support the targeting policy followed by the board to date in appointing educational welfare officers to the areas of greatest disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Schools are required to refer students to the board who have been absent for more than 20 days cumulatively during the school year or where a school principal wishes to express concern about the attendance pattern of a particular student. Staff of the NEWB make contact with the school to establish reasons for the absences and what steps have been taken to date by the school to improve the child&rsquo;s attendance. An educational welfare officer may then contact the parent in question to advise and support the parent regarding the need for the child to attend school regularly.</P>
        <P>In RAPID-designated areas, EWOs offer an intensive service to schools and parents. Outside these designated areas, the NEWB offers an urgent service, where cases of chronic absenteeism are followed up in consultation with schools.</P>
        <P>In November last, my Department conveyed approval to the NEWB for the recruitment of a further ten educational welfare officers, bringing the authorised staffing from 84 to 94. The appointment of ten extra staff to counties which up to now have not had the benefit of the presence of an EWO will enable the NEWB to extend the intensive service.</P>
        <P>Guidelines were issued by the NEWB last month to all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences. The guidelines provide step-by-step advice on how and when school <Col N="166" />attendance returns should be made and how the new website, <i>www.schoolreturn.ie</i>, can be used by schools to comply with their legal obligations to report student absences to the board.</P>

        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, expressed concern in its 1999 report on its review of the junior cycle that the curriculum was overloaded and that there was repetition of topics in some subjects. In response, it set out to review the content of junior cycle syllabuses with the aim of re-balancing the curriculum so as to ensure that there was enough time to allow for the quality of engagement with students that was envisaged when the junior certificate was introduced in 1989 for first examination in 1992.</P>
        <P>Phase 1 of this re-balancing work is now almost complete. This involved a review of five subject areas, namely, business studies, English, history, home economics and music. Phase 2 is about to begin and this will involve Gaeilge; geography; art, craft and design; environmental and social studies; and mathematics. The outcomes of this work will be communicated to teachers, parents and others interested in education by means of a handbook which will contain the full curriculum. It is planned that the first issue of this handbook, which will contain the re-balanced syllabuses in the ten subjects, will be ready in January 2006.</P>
        <P>The inspectorate has carried out an evaluation of the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, and its report will be available in June 2005. Simultaneously, the NCCA has conducted a review and its report is in final stages of preparation. The outcomes of these processes will inform future developments of the programme. The inspectorate is currently carrying out a focused evaluation of the teaching and learning of Gaeilge in the junior cycle and a report will be published on the cumulative outcomes towards the end of the current year.</P>
        <P>The outcomes of the NCCA&rsquo;s review of languages in the post-primary curriculum is likely to have implications for junior cycle curriculum. This work will be complemented by an analysis which the Council of Europe will be conducting this year at the request of the Department of Education and Science of language policy and practice in Ireland.</P>

        <P>Admissions policy is a matter for each third level institution, having regard to the principles of equity and equality of access. I understand that the arrangements to which the Deputy refers have been put in place by Trinity College on a transitional basis to facilitate equity of access for all students, following the recent UCAS-leaving certificate benchmarking study, which resulted in changes in the relative weightings given by the college to grades achieved in A levels <i>vis-a-vis</i> those obtained in the leaving certificate.</P>

        <P>Council Directive 85/433/EEC provides for the free movement of pharmacists within the European Economic Area, EEA. Under EU Directives 85/432/EEC and 85/433/EEC, any EU/EEA national holding a recognised pharmacy qualification from such a state is entitled to register as a pharmacist in Ireland, in accordance with free movement provisions.</P>
        <P>Ireland avails of a derogation under Article 2.2 of 85/433/EEC which gives member states the option of not recognising the qualification of any national of an EU/EEA member state who is qualified as a pharmacist regarding the ownership, management or supervision of a pharmacy that is less than three years old or for the establishment of a new pharmacy. A pharmacist who qualified in another EU/EEA member state, and who is a national of such a state, may not own in his or her own right, operate or manage a pharmacy that is less than three years old.</P>
        <P>Nationals of non-EU/EEA member states are subject to the criteria laid down for recognition of pharmacy qualifications and the registration of pharmacists by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the statutory body charged with this duty in Ireland. Controls exist in other member states on the establishment and operation of pharmacies. For example, at least ten member states restrict ownership to pharmacists, ten restrict ownership to one pharmacy, seven use population and distance criteria and four, Ireland, Belgium, Holland and the UK, have no restrictions. In addition, seven countries, Ireland, France, Germany, Holland, Austria, Portugal and the UK, have invoked the derogation under article 2.2.</P>
        <P>As recommended by the pharmacy review group, I am examining the continued use of the derogation in the context of new pharmacy legislation which will consolidate and modernise the practice of pharmacy in Ireland. This will provide a more comprehensive framework for the supervision and management of pharmacy services.</P>

        <P>The report of a consultancy study jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Belfast on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical services for the island of Ireland was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The study concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital transfer service would be appropriate in an all-island context. The study estimated the cost at &euro;12 million capital and &euro;4 million revenue for a single helicopter. Inter-hospital air ambulance services are provided by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard, subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Most patient transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of Defence are finalising a service level agreement to formalise arrangements for the future provision of an air ambulance service by the Air Corps. A significant helicopter fleet replacement programme is being put in place for the Air Corps. Each of the new helicopters will have a specific air ambulance capability. The new fleet will also have a far greater flying capacity than is currently available. My Department has also reached agreement with the Department of <Col N="172" />Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that the Irish Coast Guard will continue to provide air ambulance services on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised that plans are being developed within the private sector for the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical services, primarily in an inter-hospital transfer role and with a view to the service becoming operational in 2005. My Department will be closely monitoring developments in this regard.</P>

        <P>There are a range of professionals and support staff involved in the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability. Agencies operate different models of care and services are provided in a multidisciplinary setting. The model of care utilised by an agency is influenced by the particular ethos of the body and the wishes of the families and individuals who use the service. Some services are nurse-led while, in others, social care staff have a key role in the provision of services. Registered Nurses Intellectual Disability, RNID, has followed a curriculum that equips its members to provide stimulation, emotional support, and nursing care for persons with an intellectual disability, of all ages and abilities, in all settings &mdash; residential and community. It emphasises the importance of working with other professionals as well as family members, in planning and implementing the therapeutic programme of care, to ensure that each person receives appropriate assistance and direction in providing for needs that cannot be met independently and in developing greater independence. RNIDs and other health care staff in the ID sector provide a very important service which greatly enhances the lives of clients of these services.</P>
        <P>In regard to the pay issue the position is as follows. The final report of the Joint Committee on Social Care Professions made recommendations in relation to pay and grading structures for child care workers. The pay recommendation provided for increases of 17% to 27% for houseparents-child care leaders and assistant houseparents-childcare workers in the residential sector. The benchmarking body (PSBB) referred to this report and recommended that these increases be extended to similar grades in the intellectual disabilities sector, IDS. In March 2004 the Labour Court considered a claim from the Alliance of Nursing Unions for a 10.55% pay increase for nurses working in the intellectual disability sector, to restore a &lsquo;differential&rsquo; that existed between nurses and social care professionals prior to the determination of the public sector benchmarking body.</P>
        <P>While the Labour Court accepted that Registered Nurses Intellectual Disability, RNID, had traditionally been paid more than social care professionals, it stated that no formal pay differential existed between the two grades. The court noted that an understanding had been reached at the Labour Relations Commission on 3 September 2003 between the employers and the Alliance of Nursing Unions, and that both parties had accepted that the report of the PSBB severed all pay links and established new absolute levels of <Col N="176" />pay for benchmarked grades. There was also an acceptance that any future benchmarking exercise, or whatever subsequent arrangements are put in place for determining public service pay, is the appropriate forum to examine the position of RNIDs <i>vis-a-vis</i> other social care professionals. The court also noted that this understanding was rejected by members of the Alliance of Nursing Unions leading to the referral to the matter to the court.</P>
        <P>The court issued its recommendation on 1 April 2004. Having considered the written and oral submissions, the court was of the view that the claim could not be dealt with outside of the established agreements. Accordingly the court recommended that the matter be dealt with in accordance with the understanding reached between the parties at the conciliation conference on 3 September 2003 and that it be given priority in this exercise.</P>
        <P>A further benchmarking exercise will commence in the second half of 2005 and this will provide an opportunity for nurses&rsquo; unions to make a case on behalf of the RNIDs.</P>

        <P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, that is, &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001.</P>
        <P>The HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates.</P>
        <P>A review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently under way involving all of the key stakeholders. Pending the outcome of the review the current approved subvention rates will remain in place.</P>

        <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the recruitment of the national directors within the interim Health Service Executive (iHSE), which took place in 2004.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Health Service Executive that the iHSE awarded a contract to PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, following a tendering process, to manage the recruitment of eight national directors. The eight positions were advertised in the national media during the summer of 2004. PWC compiled a list of applicants and then recommended a shortlist of suitable candidates, in each category, to the iHSE.</P>
        <Col N="178" />
        <P>I understand that interview panels were established, which comprised the executive chairman of the iHSE; members of the board of the iHSE; some senior public and civil servants, including retired senior public and civil servants; and other suitably qualified individuals. Following the interview process job offers were made in respect of six of the positions. In respect of the remaining two positions, there was no preferred candidate from either interview. The iHSE subsequently made acting appointments in respect of both of these unfilled positions.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised me that further senior management positions have been identified by the HSE, and acting appointments have been made pending recruitment. Recruitment for these additional positions will be managed by the Public Appointments Service.</P>

In 2004, IFSRA wrote to all lenders and insurers seeking information on their endowment businesses. The information requested included details of, <i>inter alia, </i>the number of endowment policies currently in force, the number of policyholders likely to be impacted by shortfalls and requested details of the steps institutions are taking to inform and advise their customers of options available where a shortfall is projected.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their customs service currently has nine drug detector dog teams in operation at strategic locations throughout the country. These locations are Cork, Dublin Port &mdash; two teams, Dublin Airport &mdash; two teams, Rosslare, Sligo, Shannon and Waterford. The dogs are trained to detect cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and amphetamines. One team is also trained in the detection of ecstasy and one also has the additional capability to detect tobacco products. Two of the dogs are specifically trained to operate in passive &ldquo;sit and stare&rdquo; mode.</P>
        <P>The dog teams are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year and while they are principally deployed at the above-mentioned locations, they are used elsewhere as required. They also provide support to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on request. Additionally they help in promoting the role of Revenue&rsquo;s customs service in drugs law enforcement by participating at relevant public events.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s customs dog teams assisted in the detection of drug seizures with street values in excess of &euro;6.3 million during 2004 and in excess of &euro;4 million in 2003. The number of individual drug seizures made in 2004 as a result of indications by the dog teams was 186. In 2003 the figure was 101 seizures. The Revenue Commissioners believe the detector dog teams are a valuable resource in the battle to combat would-be drug smugglers and there are plans to expand the current number of teams from nine to 11 and to provide for a capability to detect cash.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
        <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to a particular vessel constructed by a company based in Cornwall, England.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, each passenger ship is built to required specified statutory standards which take into account the intended use of the vessel. The hulls are also independently checked and passed by the maritime safety directorate of this Department as the national licensing authority rather than the Maritime and Coastguard Agency which is the UK licensing authority.</P>
        <P>The legislation to which the Deputy may be referring is Council Directive 1998/18/EC on safety rules and standards for sea-going domestic passenger ships. Ships classified as class VI passenger ships would appear to be the passenger ships referred to in the question. Such class VI ships can only be constructed in materials other than steel or equivalent and are not covered by SI No. 716 of 2004, the regulations transposing the EC directive.</P>
        <P>The appropriate legislation in this case is the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ship Construction and Survey) Rules 1985 (SI 274 of 1993); Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Rules 1985; and Merchant Shipping (Life Saving Appliances) Rules 1983.</P>
        <P>The maritime safety directorate is currently in the process of updating the regulations in relation to those classes of domestic passenger ships which are not covered by Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ship) Regulations, 2004 (SI No.716 of 2004). This process includes the updating of regulations for class VI passenger ships constructed in materials other than steel or an equivalent material. This update is required because an anomaly exists whereby the EC directive does not apply to GRP vessels.</P>
        <P>The requirements contained in Council Directive 1998/18/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships are significantly higher than those under the current domestic legislation and thereby a class VI passenger ship constructed in materials other than steel or an equivalent material offers a lower level of safety to the passenger on board. Under Council Directive 98/18/EC and 1974 International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, an increased level of structural fire protection is required in ships where more than 36 passengers are carried. While existing class VI passenger ships are not affected by the proposal, the proposed regulations will only allow newly constructed class VI passenger ships to carry up to 36 passengers.</P>
        <P>New class VI ships shall require an &ldquo;A&rdquo; class fire division around the machinery space and the provision of fire detection and fire appliances in accordance with the European Communities (Passenger Ship) Regulations 2004 (SI No. 716 of 2004). This is necessary so that a class VI ship will provide an equivalent level of safety to a ship <Col N="184" />constructed in steel or an equivalent material and afford the passenger a higher level of safety.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the serious concern of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus at the increased levels of activity in the property market in the northern part of the island. The Cypriot authorities have drawn the attention of partners in the EU to their particular concern that much of the property development undertaken in recent years has involved land which is legally owned by citizens of Cyprus who were forced to leave the area in 1974.</P>
        <P>The issue of property rights is a crucial element in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, on which the United Nations has the lead role. The Government is regularly in contact with the various parties, and Ireland was particularly engaged in encouraging agreement on a settlement based on the proposals of the UN Secretary General in early 2004, during the Irish EU Presidency. The EU has recognised the positive contribution of the Turkish Government to the process last year. We have strongly encouraged Turkey to start a process in the context of preparations for the opening of accession negotiations with the EU which will lead to the normalising of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus. The issue of property rights, however, will not be resolved until a comprehensive settlement has been agreed in Cyprus.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not recognise the &ldquo;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&rdquo;, in line with UN Security Council Resolutions 541, of 1983, and 550, of 1984, which are binding on all members of the United Nations. The Republic of Cyprus has been a member state of the EU since 1 May 2004. In the absence of a comprehensive settlement, the application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island is suspended.</P>
        <P>Any Irish citizen considering the purchase of property in the area in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control should consider very carefully all the complex legal issues involved. I believe that it is important also to take full account of the political background. Any future comprehensive settlement in Cyprus will include provisions on property rights which, depending on the particular circumstances, could have very serious practical or financial implications for people who have purchased property in the northern part of the island.</P>

        <P>Clearly, the issues raised by the Deputy are concerned with the private contractual relationships between the parties to a contract and as such not a matter for which I am responsible. However, from a common-sense point of view it is always prudent to obtain independent advice from lawyers and other relevant experts when purchasing land and property, especially when it is overseas. It makes sense that persons buying property anywhere carry out a fundamental due diligence and inspection of the property. As I have no function in this matter, I do not think it is appropriate that I advise people on issues which are the subject of law in foreign jurisdiction, international law, and possibly also Irish law and tax legislation.</P>

        <P>As previously stated in my predecessor&rsquo;s reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Question of 27 April 2004 &mdash; Reference No. 11482/04 and my reply on 25 November 2004 &mdash; Reference No. 30915/04, my Department was formally notified of the proposed redundancy of the person concerned on 17 December 2003, when statutory form RP1, notice of proposed redundancy, was submitted in respect of that person. No further documentation has been submitted. At the time, my Department also sent this employee a copy of its updated Guide to the Redundancy Payments Scheme for her information.</P>
        <P>As the employee&rsquo;s employment was terminated on 1 August 2003, more than a year has passed since that date, and she is therefore outside the one-year time limit &mdash; 52 weeks &mdash; for making a claim for a redundancy payment. However, under section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, as amended by section 13 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, the Employment Appeals Tribunal has discretion to extend that 52-week period where it receives the necessary claim within 104 weeks of the date of dismissal and is satisfied that the delay by the employee in making his or her claim arose through reasonable cause. The tribunal, which provides a fair, inexpensive and informal means for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringements of their statutory rights, including redundancy-related matters, is based at Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2 and has hearings across the country. Its telephone number is (01) 6313005/6313006, Lo-Call: 1890 220 222.</P>
        <P>If the person concerned does not bring a claim before the Employment Appeals Tribunal by the end of July 2005, she will be out of time for establishing her entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment. If she wishes to contact my Department about her redundancy, she should contact the redundancy section of my Department at telephone number (01) 6313051.</P>
        <P>I have again arranged to have the appropriate form for bringing a claim before the tribunal sent to the person concerned, together with another copy of the Guide to the Redundancy Payments Scheme. I have also arranged to have this documentation copied to the Deputy for information.</P>

        <P>The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme administered by my Department is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security. A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
        <P>The structure of the allowance was changed in 2003 to make it a cash credit on bills and not attributable to any particular component of the bill. Previously the allowance had covered the line and instrument rental charges specifically, with a small element of call costs on each two-monthly client bill. Currently, the allowance stands at &euro;20.41 per month, at an estimated cost of &euro;92.2 million in 2004. The change in the structure of the telephone allowance was designed to make it easier for eligible clients to choose from a range of participating service providers, as the newly standardised allowance can be applied to phone bills from any service provider irrespective of the tariff components.</P>
        <P>Depending on which service provider is chosen, the &euro;20.41 per month paid by the Department can cover line rental and instrument rental as well as providing a set value of free calls. If the customer has a high-speed ISDN line, the allowance may be used to offset part of that cost.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs,</askee>
        <Quest>further to Question No. 546 of 26 January 2005, the reason the maximum household income of &euro;317.43 per week was not increased for community employment participants in order for them to qualify for the tapered rent supplement rate.</Quest>

        <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
        <P>While the &euro;317.43 income limit to which the Deputy refers has not been increased recently, other improvements, which I identified in my previous reply, have been made to the arrangements for assessing the amount of rent supplement payable to those participating in community employment schemes.</P>
        <P>I consider that the current eligibility thresholds and disregards, together with improvements in the standard rules of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, ensure that people continue to have a financial incentive to take up employment opportunities. For example, a lone parent with one child in Dublin is usually entitled to rent supplement of &euro;89.50 per week when taking up a community employment place and is &euro;60 per week better off as a result of participating in a CE scheme. On this basis, I have no plans to increase the income threshold in question.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of these threshold and income disregard arrangements will be considered further in the context of a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which my Department is undertaking during 2005.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to offer customers as wide a choice of payment options as possible. <Col N="192" />The current choice includes payment at post offices by means of a PPO book, payment electronically using a swipe card at post offices, by cheque to customers home address and direct payment to customers bank accounts, EFT. Currently 31% of customers are paid by EFT.</P>

        <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance and was refused on the grounds that her weekly means exceeded the statutory limit. Her means, derived from her spouse&rsquo;s earnings and a small amount of farm income, amount to &euro;265.95 weekly following the application of the &euro;500 income disregard that applies in the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>Guidelines governing the application of the means test allow for a reasonable amount to be granted for travel expenses. In this case the amount of a travel allowance initially granted was reviewed and a revised allowance of &euro;50 per week was applied. Her means, however, still exceed the statutory limit for carer's allowance.</P>

        <P>The new Shannon Airport Authority was incorporated in September 2004 and, in line with the framework provided by the State Airports Act 2004, it is envisaged that the new authority would, in due course, own and operate Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the 2004 Act, each of the new airport authorities, including the Shannon Airport Authority, is required to prepare comprehensive business plans for their airport and this work is currently ongoing. The formulation of these business plans will be a key aspect of achieving operational and financial readiness on which both I and the Minister for Finance must be satisfied before the assets of Shannon and Cork Airports are vested in the new airport authorities.</P>
        <P>Among the measures required for the future development of Shannon Airport on a successful and sustainable basis in an increasingly competitive environment are traffic growth and the need to address the airport&rsquo;s cost base. It has been recognised for some time that costs in Shannon are high relative to comparable airports. Under the overall stewardship of the Dublin Airport Authority, the Shannon Airport Authority is seeking to address this issue in consultation with union representatives.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department administers a number of well-established grant schemes aimed at assisting communities experiencing disadvantage or isolation. In addition, my Department receives applications from groups or individuals that seek funding outside the parameters of established schemes.</P>
        <P>Groups are well aware that, from time to time, Departments may, going into December, identify unexpected savings on their Vote for a variety of reasons. Where such potential savings on the Vote arise very late in the year they can provide the opportunity to provide support in a few such cases without reducing the spend on the established schemes. Timeframes involved result in uncertainty as to availability of any funding in this area.</P>
        <P>Clearly, criteria for considering applications in this context apply. In the case of the once-off payments made by this Department towards the end of 2004 the broad criteria that were applied included: appropriate to the Department&rsquo;s Vote; focus on disadvantage-isolation; promoting and supporting community development; developing the State&rsquo;s relationship with the community and voluntary sector; and promoting rural development, particularly in the area of transport, health, housing and education. These criteria are informed, <i>inter alia</i>, by the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy.</P>
        <P>In 2004, applications from nine groups were considered for funding under this heading. Five of the groups were approved for funding. The amount allocated under this heading in 2004 was &euro;530,000 out of a total Departmental spend close on &euro;310 million.</P>
        <P>The accounting and audit requirements attaching to these once-off payments are set out in the following appendix:</P>
        <P el="10" Italics="Y">Appendix</P>
        <P>Once-off payments &mdash; Conditions applying: the group&rsquo;s income and expenditure account show clearly receipt of this funding; receipts and vouchers to the total value of the grant should be retained by group (a receipt is a voucher which is clearly marked paid on its face); a statement by the group&rsquo;s auditors to the effect that they have examined the group&rsquo;s accounts and can certify that the grant was spent for the purposes set out; submission of a copy of the group&rsquo;s audited accounts as soon as they become available; adherence to the required tax clearance arrangements; payment of this grant will be subject to appropriate checks by our internal audit unit during 2005.</P>

        <P>The matter raised by the Deputy is the responsibility of Waterways Ireland, one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999. The body has responsibility for the management, maintenance and development of inland waterways, principally for recreational purposes.</P>
        <P>The bridge mentioned was originally built in the 19th century to carry road traffic of that time and has a load carrying capacity well below the loadings being imposed today. As a result, the bridge has become structurally distressed and had to be closed for reasons of public safety.</P>
        <P>Waterways Ireland is in ongoing discussions with the local authority to agree aspects of the repair and upgrade of this bridge to ensure that the needs of modern day vehicular traffic are met. The question of using the towpath on the opposite bank of the canal as an alternative route has been raised, but is not feasible due to the threat to the structural integrity of the canal bank.</P>

        <P>Following the closure of the Carlow sugar processing plant, Irish Sugar Limited. intends to process the entire Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which will be upgraded. The question of developing an ethanol production plant would be a commercial matter for the company and I have not engaged in discussions with it in that regard. Promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland are matters, in the first instance, for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In so far as my remit is concerned, the EU sugar regime provides support for sugar beet and sugar production but ethanol derived from sugar beet does not come within the scope of the regime.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, all livestock premia and arable aid schemes have been replaced, since 1 January 2005, by the new single payment scheme. Accordingly, the quota regime in respect of the livestock premia schemes does not apply to the single payment scheme and, consequently, quotas, including individual suckler cow and ewe premium quotas, no longer exist for any farmer after that date and are not required to ensure payment of the single payment scheme in the future.</P>
        <P>The person named does not have any entitlements established for him as he did not receive direct payments during the reference period. He applied under the <i>force majeure</i> and new entrant measures but did not qualify under either provision as he was not an applicant under the direct payment schemes during the reference years, 2000-2002, or the earlier reference years, 1997 to 1999.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the 2005 single payment national reserve is that applications were invited to the reserve in December 2004 and the closing date for receipt of completed applications was extended from 14 January 2005 to 21 January 2005. If the person named commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or during 2002 without having received a direct payment in that year, he should have applied to the reserve under category D. All applications to the 2005 single payment national reserve, including those under category D, are being processed at present and in view of the number of applications received and accompanying documentation submitted, it will be some time before processing is completed. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible to indicate whether the person named will qualify for an allocation of entitlements from the reserve on foot of any application submitted. Applicants will be notified of their eligibility or <Col N="199" />otherwise as soon as all applications are processed.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women was established by Government in December 1997 as part of its response to the issue of violence against women. The establishment of the committee was a recommendation contained in the report of the task force on violence against women, which was published in April 1997. The national steering committee is chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and its membership comprises representatives of the Departments with responsibility for this issue, the non-governmental organisations working in this <Col N="201" />area, representatives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, the Probation and Welfare Service, the health boards and the medical and legal professions. The remit of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women is to provide,<i> inter alia</i>, a multidisciplinary and cohesive response to this issue. The committee has a number of objectives which include ensuring that regional and local structures are established and maintained, promoting public awareness about the issues involved in violence against women, advising on the co-ordination and distribution of resources among the eight health board regions, advising on the ongoing development of policies including those concerning services and supports, criminal justice intervention and perpetrators.</P>
        <P>As regards a report, I can inform the Deputy that the committee is not required to submit one to Government but is working towards implementing the ecommendations made by the task force on violence against women and that work is ongoing. I can further inform the Deputy that a number of initiatives have been undertaken by the committee since it was established in 1997 including a number of campaigns to raise public awareness of the various aspects of violence against women.</P>
        <P>In addition, I can inform the Deputy that, on behalf of the national steering committee, my Department has recently commissioned the development of a strategic plan to further its work over the next five years.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government places a high priority on putting in place measures aimed at tackling crimes of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and other crimes of violence against women and that I and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, place a high priority on the work of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women.</P>

The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Buncrana district will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing and will have a real impact.</P>

        <Quest>if a person holding both Irish citizenship and citizenship of another country, who was not born on the island of Ireland and who subsequently gives up their Irish citizenship can then re-invoke their Irish citizenship at a later stage, in view of the fact that an Irish person born on the island of Ireland is entitled to do just that; and if he has satisfied himself that there is no differentiation in the status of the two Irish persons in a case in which one was born on the island of Ireland and the other was not in this regard.</Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>The general rules in relation to the re-acquisition of Irish citizenship differ depending on whether the person in question has a constitutional entitlement to Irish citizenship. Where a person has a constitutional entitlement to citizenship, such entitlement subsists even where the person renounces citizenship &mdash; in other words even though the person renounces citizenship he or she remains constitutionally entitled to it. In practice, such a person can exercise that subsisting entitlement by declaring his or her citizenship in the prescribed manner.</P>
        <P>In all other cases it is for the Oireachtas to determine on rules relating to the re-acquisition of citizenship. The position as enunciated in section 21 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, which covered all Irish citizens at the time of its enactment, was as follows. An Irish citizen of full age, who was a citizen of another country and for that reason desired to renounce <Col N="205" />citizenship, could do so by lodging a declaration of alienage. A condition precedent was that the person in question was ordinarily resident outside the State. Such a person was required to apply for naturalisation if he or she wished to re-acquire citizenship.</P>
        <P>Subject to one exception, that remains the position in relation to all former Irish citizens who do not have a constitutional entitlement to Irish citizenship. This includes persons who acquired citizenship by descent alone, by post-nuptial declaration and through the naturalisation process. It also includes persons born in the island of Ireland on or after 24 June 2004 who, at the time of birth, do not have at least one parent who is or is entitled to be an Irish citizen. The one exception arises in this type of case. Such persons, if born between 24 June 2004 and date of implementation of the relevant provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, 1 January 2005, continue to be dealt with for the purposes of re-acquisition after renunciation as if they are constitutionally entitled to citizenship. This exception is simply a reflection of the passage of time between the enactment of the constitutional amendment and the implementation of the primary legislation and the prospective approach taken in matters of this nature.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the introduction of a mandatory identification card is a complex issue which would require in-depth debate. Depending on the outcome of such a debate, responsibility for such a measure could fall to any one of a number of Ministers. The obligation to produce an age document to gain admission to the bar of licensed premises is intended to assist licensees to comply with legislative provisions relating to underage consumption of alcohol and to assist the Garda in enforcing the law.</P>
        <P>The national age card scheme was initiated in April 1999 under the provisions of section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. The scheme was introduced to help curb the growth in under age drinking by introducing a specially designed age card. Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by regulations provide for the issue of an age card to those who have attained 18 years of age and are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase and consume alcohol in licensed premises. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999 set out detailed provisions in relation to the application <Col N="206" />and authentication procedure as well as procedures for the preparation and issue of age cards. To date, over 189,000 cards have been issued by the Garda authorities.</P>
        <P>I would encourage licensees to accept the Garda age card as an age document for the purposes of section 15 of the 2003 Act. If a licensee suspects that such a card has been forged or altered, the Garda should be notified as it is an offence to forge a document purporting to be an age card, alter an age card, or use such a document or an altered age card with intent to deceive. In the absence of such a suspicion, I can see no reason a licensee should refuse to accept a Garda age card as an age document.</P>

This expansion is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase 1 &mdash; Bray, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2 &mdash; Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; phase 3 &mdash; Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo.</P>
        <P>The installation of the phase 1 systems in Bray, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Limerick has been completed and these systems are now fully operational. Thirteen of the 18 cameras in Galway are now fully operational. It is proposed to install the final five cameras in tandem with the major redevelopment works currently being undertaken by Galway City Council in the Eyre Square area.</P>
        <P>The issue regarding the provision of suitable space to accommodate the monitoring of CCTV cameras in Finglas Garda station is currently being considered, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, with regard to the overall accommodation needs of Finglas Garda station. It is hoped that work can proceed to completion in Finglas in 2005. Installation of the CCTV systems is, of necessity, a detailed, complex and lengthy process. The Garda authorities are giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the remaining CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I have, therefore, asked the Commissioner to submit proposals for a revised tender document for the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>I am advised that it would not be appropriate at this stage to state the specific number or location of the cameras planned for the Ballyfermot CCTV system. Camera numbers and <Col N="212" />locations have not yet been finalised and are therefore subject to change.</P>

        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at both primary and post-primary level in recent years. At primary level, the ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 to 29. At post-primary level the pupil teacher ratio has been reduced from 16:1 to 13.6:1 in the same period.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to the available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The timing and manner in which the target set out in the programme for Government can be met is being examined by my Department in consultation with the education partners. Additional posts will continue to be provided. The deployment of these posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

        <P>I recently announced details of 122 major school building projects that will progress to tender and construction over the next 12 to 15 months. My Department&rsquo;s building unit has been in contact with these schools and arranged a general information meeting to guide them through the process involved in moving projects to tender and construction. The meetings took place on 31 January and 1 February in Tullamore and all schools were invited to attend.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the day to day management of these projects is a matter for each school authority and its design team. While some of the 122 projects will be ready to go on site earlier in the year than others, all of the projects should be capable of going to tender and construction within this published timescale.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to ensure that a consistent flow of projects to tender and construction can be sustained into the future. I plan to make a number <Col N="214" />of announcements in the near future about the schools&rsquo; building and modernisation programme including: details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships; an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding; details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme; schools whose projects will further progress through the design process; schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>

        <P>Over 600 schools are receiving books under this initiative. The schools involved were selected on a priority basis using the findings of the most recent comprehensive survey on levels of disadvantage in primary schools conducted by the Educational Research Centre. The additional allocation to the national school library scheme was calculated at the rate of &euro;6 per pupil in respect of pupils enrolled in the selected schools on 30 September 2003.

        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring the draft area development plan for the N4-M4 area. The commission on school accommodation recently completed the public consultation process on the draft plan and is analysing the contents of the written and oral submissions made in this context. When the process has been completed, the commission will prepare a final plan setting out the blueprint for the development of schools in the area for the next decade. In the meantime, all applications for capital funding from schools in the area are being assessed against the published prioritisation criteria which were revised earlier this year following consultation with the education partners. Progress on individual projects is being considered in the context of the school building programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005. The announcement is the first in a series I plan to make in the coming period on the schools building and modernisation programme. The programme will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships, an expansion <Col N="219" />of the number of schools invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding, details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme, schools whose projects will further progress through the design process and schools authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>

        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The process of allocating disadvantaged posts to primary schools takes place once the mainstream staffing schedule has been finalised. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for primary schools for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. Until this process is complete, it is not possible to determine the number of mainstream posts and, consequently, disadvantaged posts to be allocated to primary schools for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>With effect from January 2005, the National Council for Special Education takes over responsibility for processing applications for resource teaching support for pupils at primary level with low incidence special educational needs on an assessed needs basis. I am having the revised model of resource teaching allocation for pupils with high incidence special educational needs and learning difficulties and delays reviewed. Pending completion of the processing of the applications and the review, it is not possible to determine the number of additional special needs teachers to be allocated to primary schools this year.</P>
        <P>My Department recently issued the initial teacher allocation for the school year 2005-06 to all post-primary schools. Applications may now be submitted by schools for additional teaching support to meet short term curricular difficulties, the needs of non-national pupils and the needs of Traveller pupils. In addition, the NCSE will process applications for additional teaching hours for children with special educational needs. Until these processes are complete, it will not be possible to determine the number of posts to be allocated to post-primary schools for the 2005-06 school year.</P>

        <P>Requests for a psychological service <Col N="221" />are frequently received in the National Educational Psychological Service. For schools with access to NEPS, the practice is for the school psychologist and relevant school staff to discuss their needs for the school year and to agree what can be done in the light of the time available. All second level schools in the free education scheme have had an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation for remedial education since the beginning of the 1990-2000 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a post.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education has recently been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers will process resource applications for children with special educational needs. The information requested on such applications is therefore not readily available within my Department. I am confident that the advent of the National Council for Special Education will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

        <P>Requests for a psychological service are frequently received in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. The practice in schools with access to NEPS is for the school psychologist and relevant school staff to discuss their needs for the school year and agree what can be done in the time available.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, took over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs on 1 January 2005 and, in particular, it is responsible deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; <Col N="222" />and deciding on applications for special needs assistant hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. The SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision on resource teaching and SNAs was made. The information requested by the Deputy is not available for these reasons.</P>
        <P>I am, however, satisfied that the establishment of the NCSE will greatly enhance the provision of services to children with special educational needs and result in a timely response to schools who have made application for SEN supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council&rsquo;s operation through the SENOs will provide a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools and I am confident this will result in a much improved service for all.</P>
        <P>Learning support is not allocated on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. Accordingly, the information sought by the Deputy is not available. In general, schools are advised to consult the learning support guidelines which have issued from my Department. The Deputy will be aware of the new system for resource teacher allocation which involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs &mdash; borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. This system also applies to those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise regarding to the particular allocation under the expected proposed model for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, my Department is reviewing the proposal to ensure it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review involves consultation with educational interests and the NCSE before it is implemented in September 2005.</P>
        <P>In addition, all schools may continue to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. The following special needs provision at primary level in County Kildare has been sanctioned by my Department to cater for the special educational needs of pupils: nine special classes for pupils with autism at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; six special classes for pupils with mild general learning disabilities at a pupil teacher ratio of 11:1; and one special class for pupils with moderate general <Col N="223" />learning disabilities at a pupil teacher ratio of 8:1. In addition to these special classes, three special schools in operation in the Kildare area cater for approximately 157 pupils with special needs with a pupil-teacher ratio ranging from 6:1 to 11:1.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding for the Saplings project, a facility sanctioned on a pilot basis, which uses applied behavioural analysis methodologies for children with autism. Approximately 30 children are enrolled in the facility.</P>

        <P>Due to the varied costs associated with undergraduate courses, my Department does not have an overall unit cost per student. However the estimated average recurrent cost to the State for the more common undergraduate courses of arts, business, science and engineering is &euro;7,000 per student per year. The average recurrent cost to the State of training a university graduate in these areas on a four year degree course is, therefore, estimated at &euro;28,000. As higher costs are associated with some courses, the unit costs to the State are higher. For example, the estimated unit cost per student to the State in respect of medicine is &euro;8,500 per annum. These figures do not take account of the substantial capital costs incurred by the State in the provision of university facilities.</P>

        <P>A unit cost system of allocating funds to the institutes of technology has not been developed. The annual budget for each institute of technology is at present allocated on the basis of its total pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of its annual programmes and budget submission which is required under the RTC-DIT Acts. The allocation takes into account the complexity of the institute, the range of courses and facilities offered to students, the total number of students, both full-time and part-time, and the nature of the infrastructure. Decisions on the allocations also have regard to Government policy and priorities.</P>

        <P>The low cost safety improvement works scheme of grants for non-national roads was introduced by my Department in 2000 as an extension of the scheme operated on national roads under the auspices of the National Roads Authority. The NRA assesses applications for grant assistance under this non-national roads scheme on behalf of my Department. The criteria for approval of grant allocations are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing demonstrable hazard and discussions between the local authority and the National Roads Authority. Westmeath County Council submitted nine applications to my Department for funding under this scheme in 2005, but these did not include the location in question.</P>
        <P>Local authorities may also use their own resources, as supplemented by my Department&rsquo;s discretionary improvement grant, to fund traffic calming works. In 2005, the total discretionary improvement grant allocation to Westmeath County Council is &euro;510,000. The prioritisation of <Col N="228" />works to be funded is a matter for Westmeath County Council.</P>

        <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the shared ownership scheme houses are acquired by a local authority and leased to the shared owner, who purchases at least 40% of the value of the house and rents the remaining equity from the local authority. The local authority finances the transaction by borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency. The shared owner must purchase full ownership within 30 years.</P>
        <P>For transactions commenced on or after 1 January 2003, the annual rent is calculated at 4.3% of the value of the local authority equity and the rent is increased by a fixed 4.5% on 1 July each year. The rent is used to repay the cost of the local authority equity to the Housing Finance Agency and, depending on the level of mortgage interest rates obtaining, may also increase or decrease the capital outstanding on the local authority share at the end of each year. These arrangements represent a significant improvement on the previous terms of the scheme for the shared owner.</P>
        <P>The rental formula applied under the scheme is not comparable to rents in the private rented sector, which are determined by the operation of the market. Therefore, movements in private sector rent levels would have no relevant bearing on the calculation of the rental element under shared ownership. The terms of the shared ownership scheme are kept under review by my Department.</P>

        <P>The shared ownership scheme is one of a number of schemes designed to facilitate those on low to modest incomes to purchase their first home.

        <Col N="230" />
        <P>The scheme is administered by the local authorities in accordance with general terms and conditions set down by my Department.
