   <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need to upgrade the science laboratories at Holy Faith secondary school, Clontarf, the need for the rewiring of the entire school premises as the student take-up rate for science is very high, and to give the school the maximum support and assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to provide the &euro;50 million in the upcoming budget that is necessary to implement the McIver report that was commissioned under the terms of Sustaining Progress to provide appropriate resourcing, staffing, structuring and development of the post-leaving certificate sector that caters for almost 30,000 students. This report has remained unimplemented for the past two and a half years despite the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s commitment to implement its recommendations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the manner in which the planning approval for the proposed gas terminal at Bellanaboy was handled whereby certain interested parties were able to make direct presentations to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the issue while other applicants were not provided with such an opportunity, and the need for the Taoiseach, and the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline what communications their Departments had with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in that regard.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the serious implications for the Ballina area and the Moy, which depends so much on angling tourism, of the report on inland fisheries and the proposed disengagement of the State from the management and development of inland fisheries with further re-privatisation of our national assets to the detriment of our people.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 27, Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to adjourn at 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 1, Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Marie-Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin has been outside the gates of Leinster House for the past number of weeks. Her claim is that the institution in which she was abused is not included in the Residential Institutions Redress Act. Her further claim is that after the closing date for inclusion of these institutions, a case was made to the Progressive Democrats for the inclusion of an institution after the date and this was duly done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It does in the sense that I am asking whether the T&aacute;naiste will amend the Residential Institutions Redress Act to cater for this woman&rsquo;s very legitimate claim?</P>
    <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste forward me a report in respect of the Children Act? I have raised this matter on a number of occasions. Sections 96, 111, 112, 115 to 132, inclusive, and 137 to 139, inclusive, have not been implemented and despite the Taoiseach giving assurances that reports would be forthcoming, it has not happened.</P>
    <P>When are we likely to see the pharmacy Bill? Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm whether the post of chief pharmacist within the Department of Health and Children has been filled in view of the concerns expressed by individuals about public health protection and patient safety?</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to amend the code of conduct for office holders or are we to have a situation where Ministers of State order private secretaries to attend various functions? I ask this in light of the antics of the &ldquo;engine Callely&rdquo;?</P>

	<P>What is going on in Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government intend to amend the legislation to allow Ministers of State to order public servants to attend at their whim whatever meetings, political or otherwise, they wish?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I think about seven institutions were added in the summer to the list by the Minister for Education and Science. They were institutions where the State had an inspection role and, therefore, had responsibilities. No institution is on that list and part of the legal redress if the State did not have an inspection role.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should talk to that woman outside.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister for Education and Science has met the lady in question and spoken to her. I am not familiar with the purpose of each section in the Children Act but I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will come to the Cabinet shortly with an implementation programme for a number of sections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Minister of State, Deputy Callely?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have two pharmacy Bills, one dealing with some fitness to practise issues that will come before the House early next year. The second Bill is scheduled for later in the year or at the start of 2007. On the chief pharmacist and other professionals at the Department of Health and Children, the salaries paid do not appear to attract many people from the outside. Real issues exist regarding medical expertise. The chief pharmacist who retired has made himself available to the Department on an advisory basis and I am not aware of any plan to amend the code of conduct for office holders.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1808"/>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be amended.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Or get people to comply with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste in her capacity as Minister for Health and Children one question, which concerns the vulnerability of older people in this cold weather. Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that the fuel allowance has not been increased since 2002? The fuel allowance is &euro;9. Does the T&aacute;naiste know a half a bag of coal costs almost &euro;9?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a hot subject.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Rabbitte have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do. After three years it was stated that the fuel allowance will be increased in the budget. It will not be implemented until late January.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>People are <i>in extremis</i>, in circumstances where ESB prices have increased by 44% since 2002.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is being disorderly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Ceann Comhairle should have more empathy with this than most people. Old people not in a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is here to implement Standing Orders and not to express opinion on any issue. The Deputy knows he is out of order. There are ways it can be raised and I suggest Deputy Rabbitte raises it in the appropriate manner. It is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Older people are vulnerable in weather that is predicted to be unprecedentedly inclement. I ask the T&aacute;naiste in her capacity as Minister for Health and Children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whether she will implement some measures immediately in respect of the fuel allowance.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I ask Deputy Rabbitte to resume his seat.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1809"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Ceann Comhairle permit the T&aacute;naiste to reply? Thousands of older people are fearful of the cold weather&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows he is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Ceann Comhairle will not permit her to reply.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are procedures and Standing Orders in this House which apply to every Member. The Deputy cannot ask a question appropriate to a line Minister on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes he can.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other ways that the Deputy can raise the matter in this House if he wishes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is not correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s indulgence, I would like to hear what the T&aacute;naiste has to say on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>If she has anything to say.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste cannot be out of order any more than any Deputy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I must tell the Ceann Comhairle that if he continues this into the next year, he will invite a motion of no confidence. Whereas his own might vote for him, he will have lost the confidence of this side of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair does not have his own in this House. The Chair lives in isolation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There has never been a situation in my time in this House where a leader of a party is not permitted to raise a matter such as this on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows well that Leaders&rsquo; Questions was established to give leaders a chance to ask questions on topical issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Leaders&rsquo; Questions only apply on Tuesday and Wednesday. I asked a perfectly civilised question and I ask the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of the Government what is her response to it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1810"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, gave the information to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Let the T&aacute;naiste answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>She must give a response.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle should allow the question. It is a human interest question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is acting head of Government this morning. I asked a simple question and politely I ask the T&aacute;naiste to answer it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is governed by Standing Order 26.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Smith is watching carefully.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>For the benefit of Members, Standing Order 26 refers to statements on the Order Paper, &ldquo;the taking of business which has been promised, including legislation either within or outside the D&aacute;il; about the making of secondary legislation; about arrangements for sittings; and as to when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper needed in the House will be circulated&rdquo;, subject to the provision that &ldquo;the Taoiseach may defer replying to a question relating to the making of secondary legislation to another day&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, normally on Thursday mornings, flexibility is given in the context of Leaders&rsquo; Questions. A valid question was posed to the T&aacute;naiste. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs gave the information to the T&aacute;naiste. It is a relevant question. Older people throughout the country want an answer from this Government on why the fuel allowance has not been increased.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ryan knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is depriving and denying the T&aacute;naiste the opportunity to reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy S&eacute;an Ryan wishes to see Standing Orders changed, I suggest he speaks to his Whip. The Chair has no difficulty implementing the Standing Orders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been here for almost 18 years and flexibility has always been given on a Thursday morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Government&rsquo;s own accounts show it has made a windfall gain of &euro;100 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1811"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on rising fuel costs by the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is. Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question is simple. Will some of that &euro;100 million windfall be given back to our old age pensioners?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order. I ask Deputy Burton to resume her seat.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is topical question and is perfectly valid on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Burton want me to read out Standing Order 26 again?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will some of that &euro;100 million be given back on 7 December to our old age pensioners? It is a simple question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, neither the Ceann Comhairle nor the T&aacute;naiste would know what can be acquired for &euro;9 by an older person in this country who wants a bag of coal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is being allowed here this morning is a scandal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Doubling the fuel allowance would cost approximately &euro;80 million. It has already made a windfall gain of &euro;100 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask Deputy Burton to resume her seat.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is totally disorderly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are asking the T&aacute;naiste a topical question. Is the Government prepared to give that back to older people?</P>

	<P>I ask Deputy Burton to resume her seat.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, I ask Members to show respect for order in this House, and for the Standing Orders for which they themselves are responsible. If they do not like the Standing Orders, change them and the Chair will implement them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot change them.</P>

	<P>On a point of clarification&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1812"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are not points of clarification.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a point before this gets out of hand. Will the Ceann Comhairle accept there is historic precedent whereby the Ceann Comhairle has flexibility, particularly on matters raised on Thursday mornings? I suggest the Ceann Comhairle uses that flexibility and does not have the Minister sitting mute. A simple reply will solve the problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gormley, and then I will call the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point that is causing the problem, it is not that the Standing Orders are wrong, it is the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s inflexible interpretation of Standing Orders. We ask, in a situation where a precedent has been set for a long time, that he is flexible. Then we would not waste D&aacute;il time because I dare say the T&aacute;naiste would answer in approximately five seconds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>If she had an answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure she has an answer one way or another. I am not saying she does not have an answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Taoiseach were here on Thursdays&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That would solve the matter and would prevent this unnecessary time being used on procedure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gormley and then I will call the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not finished my point. The Ceann Comhairle is not always right about Standing Orders. He is regularly wrong as was proved yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy does not like the Standing Orders, I suggest he arranges to have them changed. If he thinks they should be simplified, have them simplified and we will all understand them. It is fairly obvious to me what Standing Order 26 is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Ceann Comhairle has discussed changing Standing Orders since this D&aacute;il was convened. When will we get a chance to change them? Backbenchers feel like fools. We cannot come in to ask a simple question. The Ceann Comhairle rules everything out of order. It is very hard for us to represent our constituents.</P>

	<P>This subject was discussed last night at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. With reference to an interjection by Deputy Breen, we discussed the issue of questions. We ask endless questions on these energy matters and we do not get answers. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is asleep at the switch.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Older people are suffering this morning. The leader of the Labour Party asked a perfectly legitimate question to the T&aacute;naiste on this bitterly cold morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, as sure as night follows day, a social welfare Bill will follow the budget to address issues of change in social welfare that will come in the budget, such as changes in the fuel allowance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On a legitimate question on the social welfare Bill I call the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>In that context Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question does relate to promised legislation. There will be such legislation after the budget.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte did not raise legislation at all.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue he raised is inevitably relevant to legislation that will arise.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>A social welfare Bill will be published to implement the budget changes. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance will announce a major package for social welfare in the budget. Concerning fuel, we extended the period covered by the allowance rather than increasing the allowance.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Government did not.</P>

	<P>Some &euro;9 for a bag of coal. Could Deputy Glennon purchase it in Fingal for this price?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions for the T&aacute;naiste but at the outset I wish to express the <Col N="1814"/>Green Party&rsquo;s support for Marie-Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin, who is outside the Kildare Street gates of Leinster House if the T&aacute;naiste wishes to speak to her.</P>
    <P>At the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Professor Brendan Drumm claimed there was a disconnect between many aspects of the health service. Can the T&aacute;naiste explain why the alcohol products Bill was dropped, given that a taskforce had been set up and consultants were hired at taxpayers&rsquo; expense, who advised the introduction of the alcohol products Bill?</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Adjournment debate concerned oncology services in Cork. Why did the T&aacute;naiste not attend the debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second question does not arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyle raised this, along with many Cork Deputies, and it would have been in order for the T&aacute;naiste to turn up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very interested in this issue because the doctor in question has contacted my office a number of times on the provision of a private facility for cancer care at Cork University Hospital. I am more than familiar with the issues in Cork.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

	<P>Concerning the alcohol products Bill, which was raised as a priority question some days ago, we have decided on a voluntary code in the first instance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste hired and paid consultants. She speaks of value for money but where is the value for money in this case? After hiring these consultants the T&aacute;naiste ignored their advice.</P>
   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>This week we heard disturbing disclosures on the state of cancer services in the Munster area, which caused much upset. These matters are the direct responsibility of the T&aacute;naiste. In an unprecedented Adjournment debate, five Deputies raised this issue and the Minister with direct responsibility sent an apology, which I do not accept, instead of attending.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not arise on the Order of Business. The Deputy must find another way to convey his views.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>All we received was a parrot-like response from the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a very good answer.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues wish to contribute.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>This sends a two-fingered signal to the people of the Munster area, as she does not give a damn.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Allen not to abuse the privilege of this House. He is being disorderly.</P>

	<P>Deputy Allen is raising an issue that has been raised on all three days this week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not. I am raising the issue of the absence of the T&aacute;naiste, who did not give a damn and did not attend last night&rsquo;s Adjournment debate. Will she apologise for not turning up? Can I get an answer?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter was raised by Deputy Gormley and ruled out of order. I call Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the T&aacute;naiste not turn up to answer five Deputies on an issue that took up much of the time of the House over the past week?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1816"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to continue he will be suspended from the House again today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The apology should be sent to the cancer patients in Cork.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanWallace"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste did not refuse to meet the patients in Cork, like a former Minister with responsibility for health from the Opposition parties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Take it easy, Deputy Wallace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Wallace to allow Deputy Michael D. Higgins to speak.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanWallace"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I can elaborate on this if the Deputies wish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Although it is a lesser matter, I ask the T&aacute;naiste where is the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty in the Government&rsquo;s programme. Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate, in conjunction with Department of the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip, the total number of international conventions awaiting ratification? The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty has been waiting for quite some time.</P>
    <P>Ratifying UN conventions requires consultation between each Department and this is slow and cumbersome. We have a raft of international conventions for which we have voted but which we have not ratified because legislation is not in place. Can the T&aacute;naiste provide me with a list of outstanding conventions that require ratification and the state at which they are at?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The sugar beet industry is a higher priority than the nuclear test ban treaty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not suggest the sugar beet industry is not a higher priority.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be published in the middle of next year and I will ask the Chief Whip to communicate with Deputy Michael Higgins on the ratification of various treaties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the T&aacute;naiste and her Department are intent on the people of County Monaghan having to depend on general practitioners in all instances of medical and health care needs, can she fast track the medical practitioners Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That will occur in the middle of next year. What is happening in Monaghan is much less than what the Deputy&rsquo;s party colleague, the Northern Ireland Minister with responsibility for health, social services and <Col N="1817"/>public safety, Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, did in respect of services in Dungannon. All acute services were moved to Craigavon for patient safety reasons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case. If the T&aacute;naiste believes that response will erase her responsibility in the minds of the people of Monaghan and Cavan, she is backing a losing horse. The T&aacute;naiste should address her responsibilities instead of looking for excuses and scapegoats. Shame on her for totally misrepresenting the situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in should be consistent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure continuation of essential core services provided to people with disabilities through core funding of staff on community employment schemes? This refers particularly to people on F&Aacute;S schemes. Can she fund them on a full-time basis in the forthcoming budget?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>To what legislation is Deputy Ring referring? The Order of Business is not an omnibus question time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled a question but, like the previous speaker, received no answer.</P>

	<P>In the Minister&rsquo;s Department there is legislation governing maternity homes, dated 1934. Will the T&aacute;naiste examine the legislation to see if Marie-Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin and the Morning Star mother and baby homes could be investigated by her Department? Everyone in this House would like to see a solution to the problems raised by Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin outside the D&aacute;il.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not familiar with the legislation to which Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan refers. In the case of Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin, it was a private institution and the State had no inspection role and therefore the institution is not included in the legislation. That remains the position.</P>

	<P>This morning the Taoiseach openly raised the white flag before Irish Ferries&rsquo; slave labour plans. Nothing can be done, he says. <Col N="1818"/>I ask the T&aacute;naiste, is this it? Is the exploiter now to run riot? In the context of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, which is currently before the D&aacute;il, will the Government table an amendment to outlaw these modern day slavers plying Irish and European waters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Where is the outrage against Irish Ferries in official Ireland? In Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s titles, for example, where are the headlines that would normally greet a group of workers who were pushing their own interests?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins is quite right, we should have moved on to the Bill at this stage. We have not done so yet but the Deputy will have an opportunity to debate the issue shortly. The Bill will be before the House today. On the question of an amendment, is one promised?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday in Galway Circuit Court a fisherman was charged with fishing over the quota to the value of &euro;2,000. He was duly fined &euro;5,000, but the penalty did not stop there because that offence attracts an automatic confiscation of the catch and gear. That is where the real penalty arose. His catch and gear were valued at &euro;19,000. On paper, that fisherman was fined, quite properly, a sum of &euro;5,000 but the hidden kick or penalty was the automatic confiscation of his catch and gear.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining about the decision of the judge. He had no discretion because automatic confiscation is written into the law, a law we are copperfastening in this Bill. To make matters worse, the ridiculous anomaly is that if that fisherman had not been Irish, the automatic confiscation would not have happened. Does it make any sense for us to retain such a ridiculous anomaly in a Bill which is totally discriminatory <i>vis-a-vis </i>Irish fishermen? I know of nobody in this House who will stand up and support the retention of that ridiculous anomaly. Why is it in the Bill? I want an absolute commitment that the ridiculous anomaly will be removed.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to other, more serious aspects of this Bill. Examination of the relevant figures shows that under Irish legislation fishermen are fined amounts by the courts that are ten times those payable on conviction by their continental counterparts. That approach is continued in this Bill but who wants it? Nobody stands up on either the Government or Opposition side to support it. It is there because we have not decriminalised minor offences as has happened on the Continent. I, the Fine Gael Party, the Opposition and, I venture, virtually all Members of Fianna F&aacute;il except the Cabinet Minister want <Col N="1823"/>a change in the system to provide for graded administrative sanctions for minor offences. Everybody wants sustainable fisheries and we must have sanctions for breaches of the law but let us not put our fishermen to the wall and sink them beneath the waves because we are not prepared to change a system which is totally out of sync with the needs of the industry.</P>
    <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>I suggest the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, brings a message to the Government that we will support any reasonable regime for sea fisheries but will oppose from the trenches a move to continue such discrimination and ridiculous penalties against fishermen. I believe the Minister of State will be happy to do so because his presentation of the Bill did not laud the continuation of those anomalies.</P>
    <P>The only person who is in favour is the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I have not seen him in the House and I challenge him to come in to defend these ridiculous anomalies. He might say there would be legal problems in making such changes but Article 29 of the Constitution enables those problems to be overcome. Precedents exist in other areas where administrative sanctions are applied. The Minister may say they can only be applied with the consent of the defendant. I accept that but let us give the defendant the option to have it dealt with at administrative level and pay his fine like his counterpart on the Continent without incurring the enormous expenses of engaging solicitors or barristers to go to the Circuit Court, and without facing the automatic confiscation of his catching gear.</P>
    <P>Let us have a reasonable system. How often do we have to drum this message home? Withdraw the Bill and recast it to provide for administrative and graded sanctions so that the punishment fits the offence and it will have the support of the Opposition. If not it will have to go through in the teeth of opposition from this side of the House and, I venture, with a silent mutiny of Members on the Government side. Any such Members I have spoken to trenchantly oppose these provisions. I appreciate their difficulties with Government Whips and I do not challenge them on that issue but 90% of Members of this House want the Bill to be changed and the House is meant to represent the will of the people. It is the Parliament not just of the Irish fisherman but of the Irish people. Give the representatives of the Irish people a chance to bring about a situation where this important Bill, representing an important part of our economy, is one of which we can all be happy and proud. This is the one chance to do that.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, must ask who is in favour of this Bill apart from himself. There have already been interventions from the Fianna F&aacute;il chairman of the relevant committee. Clearly the members of that committee, of all <Col N="1824"/>parties, do not support these provisions. In that situation does Parliament count for anything? The pigheaded Minister, who does not have much fisheries expertise in his constituency over and above a few good rivers, supports the provisions while the rest of Parliament wants them changed. Let the voice of Parliament and the people prevail so we end up with a satisfactory Bill the terms of which fishermen will be prepared to operate fully, fairly and effectively. If we can achieve that we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regrettably, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 poses many problems for me. I do not have difficulty with the thrust of the Bill but there are five areas where change must be made for it to be acceptable.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill must provide for administrative and graded sanctions and decriminalise fisheries offences. According to EU records and standards 86% of all EU fisheries offences are now dealt with by way of administrative sanctions. As the chairman of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution I do not see any constitutional impediment to such a change in our laws.</P>
    <P>Second, the reference to seafood manager should be deleted in its entirety as it only creates a mechanism for resolving internal management accountability issues and undermines and sidelines the role of the Minister. It also states that a control regulator should be established with an appropriate appeals mechanism but this involves another roll of unnecessary and inappropriate red tape for the fishing industry. I represent Cork South-West, which is on a par with Donegal north west and is the capital of fishing in the south.</P>
    <P>Third, the automatic confiscation of catching gear, which only applies to Irish vessels, must be changed to allow it to be decided at the discretion of courts. I will read a letter for the record of the House sent to Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is from a solicitor and concerns a recent court case he encountered which emphasises the plight of fishermen. The letter reads:</P>
    <P LI="1">Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P LI="1">I heard you on the radio last week, in connection with the proposed changes in Fishery legislation, and in particular the suggestion that the penalties would be increased.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">I do a lot of work for people in the Marine business around the coast, and I have had a couple of recent cases of representing individuals under the fisheries Acts. In fact this morning, I was in the Circuit Criminal Court [where serious crimes relating to drugs, rape and violent crime against the person are dealt with, and fishermen are brought in there] representing a young fisherman whose offence was that he had not filled in the Log Book [a technical offence]. At the trial, evidence was given of extenuating circumstances &mdash; bad weather, <Col N="1825"/>mechanical breakdown, and there was no suggestion that he was to profit in any way for his administrative lapse.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Notwithstanding all of that, penalties in the amount of &euro;40,000 were imposed, comprising of a fine of &euro;10,000, forfeiture of the catch and the gear, and in addition the client was at the loss of fishing when his boat was tied up, and also the cost of legal fees...</P>
    <P FLI="0">Legal fees for the defence amounted to &euro;40,000 for a technical offence. If that happened in Europe there would be an administrative fine which would be dealt with at little cost to the State. On top of that &euro;40,000, it does not indicate what it cost taxpayers through State expenditure to bring the man to court, the arresting of the boat, the garda&iacute; involved and the time in the Circuit Court. This would probably double the cost, which indicates the severe problems that exist. I will continue to read into the record the letter, which is interesting. It represents a typical case which could take place in Castletownbere, Killybegs, the west or Dunmore East:</P>
    <P LI="1">It is interesting that in the course of the case, the Judge said he was mindful that the Oireachtas took these matters very seriously, because of severity of the proposed penalties. [In other words, the judge was saying he must impose the large fines because the Oireachtas takes the matter seriously, yet the Bill is proposing in some instances to increase by 800% the penalties that already exist, which are draconian and unfair.] If these penalties are increased further, it will mean that Judges will think that the imposition of a fine of even &euro;50,000 would be light...</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is what the Oireachtas wants, and it is the message we will send out if we adopt the Bill in its entirety. The letter goes on:</P>
    <P LI="1">Furthermore, the Fisheries Acts do not differentiate in terms of penalties between a vessel such as my client had this morning, with a crew of four, and a very large vessel which could be at sea for weeks on end. [In other words, we are dealing here with a relatively small trawler.]</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">I hope my letter to you is not regarded as being impertinent, but I think that the Oireachtas should be made aware that ordinary fishermen doing the best they can under very difficult circumstances, would be faced with absolutely draconian fines and penalties, for what would be regarded in other areas of activity, as only minor transgressions.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is the content of this important letter. Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to a case yesterday in Galway involving a fishermen I know well. He was dragged into a similar case. It was his first offence in approximately 50 years.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated three areas with which I have serious concerns. The fines and penalties detailed in the Bill lack proportionality and must <Col N="1826"/>be reduced and changed. The underlining principle must be that just serious fisheries transgressions attract serious penalties.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I do not advocate that we should go out there and deplete our stocks and rape our waters. I am aware that a small minority of fishermen transgress the law and should be brought to heel. I have no problem with the conservation of stocks. However, while we represent 1.86% of the EU fishing fleet, we appear to be saying that we are the best boys in Europe, we will put our fishermen below the waterline and sink them by way of these impossible fines with which the industry will find it difficult to cope.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provision to use firearms against fishing vessels must be deleted from the Bill. I was pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, recently indicated his desire to amend this provision. The above points require to be changed if we are to have a fisheries amendment Bill which is progressive and which will be acceptable to the stakeholders involved. There are other smaller amendments which I do not wish to discuss at this stage.</P>
    <P>We must examine the whole concept of the Irish fishing industry. Regrettably, when we joined the EEC in 1973, to use a west Cork term, the Irish fishing industry was &ldquo;left sucking the hind tit&rdquo; for which there were a number of reasons. We got a very bad deal at the time. Up to the enlargement of Europe a couple of years ago, as an island nation, Ireland had almost 25% of the entire EU waters, yet it had approximately 4% of the fishing quota. When one realises that we have less than 2% of the EU fishing fleet, we are already at a severe disadvantage as regards the Spanish, French and the other bigger nations in Europe. We got figures in Brussels the week before last when some of us met the <i>Chef de Cabinet</i> to the Commissioner and many MEPs. The most up-to-date penalty records indicate that of the 14 nations surveyed, Ireland came ninth while its transgression record was quite small compared to some of the major players in the industry.</P>
    <P>It puzzles me that the average fine in Spain for fishing without a licence &mdash; the Spanish are the masters of fishing in Europe and were treated very well in the 1970s when Ireland got a raw deal &mdash; is &euro;1,463, which is documented and accepted in Europe, while in Ireland it is &euro;21,400, and increasing. This is obvious from the letter to me from the solicitor on behalf of a fisherman who had to go before the Central Criminal Court in Dublin, which was a disgrace. The message being sent out from the D&aacute;il and Seanad is that not only do we want the penalties to be enforced but we want them to be increased. In some instances it will put fishermen out of business.</P>
    <P>The average penalty for logbook offences in Denmark is &euro;393, while in Ireland it is &euro;8,500. The instance I quoted earlier was a logbook offence. The unfortunate fisherman whose boat had broken down and who got caught in adverse <Col N="1827"/>weather conditions was penalised to the tune of &euro;40,000 the week before last in an Irish court. The average fine for fishing for species subject to prohibition in the UK is &euro;2,328 while it is &euro;23,125 in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have had many dealings with Irish fishermen over the years. People may say I am wrong, but if the Irish south and west fishing organisations and the other Irish fish producing organisations were up and running and had the same capacity, ability and expertise they now have &mdash; a number of these organisations are doing a wonderful job throughout Ireland for the fishing industry &mdash; we would have got a much better deal in 1973. At the time our negotiators were unaware of the potential of our waters. Having said that, as a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have met these organisations. In the past two or three years, representatives of the fishing industry have been travelling to Europe and batting as hard as they can, together with the Irish Ministers, to obtain a fair deal for Ireland on quotas and so on. Very often they work hand-in-hand with the Minister and his officials and, by and large, they come back with a fair result, albeit with some trepidation. Over the years, including when I was in the Seanad, these people have been asking me to do something to try to bring them into line with Europe. There is an idea that we are not in line with Europe but, in fact, we are streets ahead. They talk about endangered species but, as things stand, the most endangered species is fishermen, who are becoming scarce. Recently, when the Minister announced a substantial package for decommissioning, two trawler men who had boats of less than the required 18 metres came to me. They are crying out to get out fishing. They see all sorts of problems ahead, with difficulty getting crews, rising fuel prices and their families not wanting to get involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>We must be fair to the fishermen and the industry. It is a fledgling industry and we should be trying to nurture and protect it, not criminalising it with bureaucracy and red tape. Most of the fishermen I know, be they trawlermen, inshore fishermen or those involved in fish farming are hard working, decent men who face many obstacles. We always hear of at least one tragedy every year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government since 1997. In 1997, a substantial package was put in place for the fishermen, particularly in the south west, to upgrade and provide new boats in the white fish fleet and that was a success. I also commend the fishing industry for waking up to the fact that we must have the highest safety standards at sea and I thank the Minister and his predecessors for putting grants to achieve that in place.</P>
    <P>Representing the fishermen of south-west Cork, in Castletownbere, Schull, Baltimore, Union Hall and Kinsale, I would be doing a dis<Col N="1828"/>service to them and their families if I was to say I was happy with aspects of this Bill. I am not. If this Bill is to be passed in its current form, I would find it difficult to vote for it. I know there will be a whip but to show the strength of my indignation, I have tabled a motion signed by seven other members for the meeting of the parliamentary party. It could not be taken this week because the Minister was in Brussels. I have never in my 12 years in the Oireachtas filibustered Government legislation but in this instance I have grave concerns.</P>
    <P>This is why five members of the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources travelled to Brussels at short notice. We met 12 MEPs, two of whom were from Scotland and one from Spain, a former fisheries Minister in the last Spanish Government, and they are bemused as to why we are going ahead with this draconian legislation. There was an indication that if we did not introduce this Bill, there would be serious implications for Ireland. We heard, however, that is not the case. The EU Commissioner, who is from an island nation, visited Ireland two weeks ago. I met him in Kenmare along with a group of representatives from the fishing industry. He made it clear that as far as he was concerned Ireland was responsible for its own actions. The fishermen accept that there must be laws and regulations but it is up to us to set the bar at a certain height.</P>
    <P>There was an article recently in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> which criticised those Deputies, including me, who support the fishing industry. It was almost libellous, suggesting that we are on the take from fishermen. The article was scathing and inaccurate in many respects. Whoever wrote the article knows nothing of the fishing industry. If he did, the article would not have been written. There is an obligation on Oireachtas Members and on the media to portray the true problems fishermen face. Fishing is a perilous occupation. We saw very little media coverage of the fact that the increases in oil prices internationally have caused great difficulties for the fishermen. The cost of fuel was rising on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>We must have a fair approach to the fishing industry, there must be rules and regulations, but we must also acknowledge that the fishing industry in Ireland is under threat and we are obliged to represent and support our constituents. That is why I am lending my voice in opposition to aspects of this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm deis a bheith agam c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; n&iacute; amh&aacute;in f&aacute;n Bhille ach f&aacute; thionscal na hiascaireachta go ginear&aacute;lta sa t&iacute;r, go speisialta i dT&iacute;r Chonaill. It is not often we speak on the difficulties and the potential of the fishing industry in Ireland and for that reason I welcome the opportunity to comment on how I see the industry, particularly in my county, and to speak on the Bill.</P><Col N="1829"/>
    <P>I have been here for a long time and have seen many Bills introduced. It is a long time, however, since I have witnessed any legislation receiving such a frosty reception, and that is putting it mildly. Even before the Bill was published, the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources made its views known in no uncertain terms; it was opposed to it from beginning to end.</P>
    <P>The committee members went to the trouble of going to Europe and meeting the authorities there. The response was that they did not understand the thinking, rationale or philosophy behind the introduction of the Bill. It is significant that all our MEPs bar one and a number from Northern Ireland stated they did not understand why this Bill was being introduced at a time the fishing industry is in deep crisis.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister of State, I was born near a fishing port. My maiden speech in the House was on the fishing industry and the former Minister, P&aacute;draig Flynn, was in the ministerial seat. I was allowed to speak for an hour. Most of my contribution was in Irish and the Minister understood about half of it. Since I entered the House, I have witnessed many changes in the fishing industry in my county and nationwide. I am familiar with ports.</P>
    <P>Long before I entered the House, Bunbeg was a vibrant, thriving fishing port which had capacity for between 30 and 40 half deckers. Each boat had three or four crew members and, therefore, 120 families in that part of Gweedore made a living from fishing every year. This time of the year, they would have fished for herring. When I went to school, the chat between us was about how many crates each boat caught. If a boat had between 20 and 35 crates, it was doing well. During the summer, the boats fished for salmon and they fished for whatever was available at other times of the year. However, Bunbeg kept families in the area. They built their houses and educated and reared their children. Fishing provided a viable economy in that little region. The same applied to the islands off Donegal.</P>
    <P>The next port along the coast is Burtonport. The great difficulty in this port 15 or 20 years ago was the availability of berths for trawlers and half deckers. The port provided many jobs onshore with all the industries associated with fishing represented. However, nowadays, do even two or three boats fish out of Burtonport? That is an indication of what is happening to the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Our pride and joy in Donegal is Killybegs, the premier fishing port in Ireland. When one drives through the town to the port, one cannot fail but to be impressed by it. It is a state-of-the-art port with the finest pier in the State. It is well deserved because the men and women of Killybegs have put a great deal into the fishing industry for generations. There is seldom a week I do not travel through the town but it has completely changed in recent years. Previously, between 1,000 and <Col N="1830"/>1,500 people from Glencolumbkille, Donegal town, the Rosses and the Finn Valley, were employed in various processing plants at this time of year. It was the most significant industry in that part of Donegal. However, Killybegs is a dead town. I hope fortunes will improve and the town will return to its former glory. Despite the provision of a state-of-the-art pier, not enough fish are being landed to underpin jobs in the town.</P>
    <P>The Government is presiding over the demise of the fishing industry. It has responded by introducing a draconian Bill and I cannot understand the rationale and philosophy behind it. A day does not go by without a fishing crisis. Honest fisherman going about their business and earning a livelihood are being towed into Rathmullan, Killybegs and other ports. The significance of this is that most of them are Irish. I seldom hear reports about the arrest of fishermen from other member states. Yesterday, the <i>Catherine R</i>, an Irish boat, was towed into port.</P>
    <P>Crab fishermen are also in a predicament. They only have five or six boats but they have been tied up for the past week and a half. The fishermen are not permitted to engage in what they have invested in heavily over recent years. They have invested millions of euro in their boats but they are all tied up in port with 70 or 80 jobs in jeopardy. The largest crab processing factory in Europe at Meenaneary, Carrick, County Donegal, is under threat because the supply of fish has been interrupted. The dispute has serious implications for employment at the factory. According to the latest bulletins, the Minister of State is trying to break the impasse so that the fishermen can return to sea. However, he should redouble his efforts to end the scandal of having these boats tied up during their peak season. The highest prices will be achieved for crab between now and Christmas because of the demand in the markets the fishermen have steadily built up over the years. If they cannot meet the demand, fishermen from other countries will do so. They must be permitted to provide continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister of State will solve this problem. Swapping quotas with other countries has been mentioned as well as bringing forward next year&rsquo;s allocation to take advantage of high prices. While a solution must be achieved, the manner in which the fishing industry is organised is wrong. We are careering daily from one crisis to another. Why is a fair share not allocated at the end of the year so that fishermen can make it last the following year? Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s experience and the goodwill of all those involved, a solution surely can be found to rectify these problems and give fishermen hope. If they continue to be treated like this, they will leave the industry. The same happened in farming. Ireland will end up with half a dozen major fishing concerns and between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers in 20 years. Ireland has better fishing grounds than every other member state and that <Col N="1831"/>would be a disaster. It would border on criminal if we let the industry go.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is in a serious downward spiral. It is more important in my county than in others because it is a barometer of economic activity, development and well-being. If the fishing industry is doing well, we are all happy, but if it is depressed, we are all depressed. It is more important than ever when one realises that Donegal has already lost 7,000 industrial jobs throughout the county in the last seven or eight years. What did we have to replace these jobs if we could not depend on, develop and gain the full potential of a natural asset such as fishing? Farming has its own difficulties but fishing was there for Donegal. We were near the sea, we had the expertise and the tradition, and we seem to be simply letting it slip through our fingers. I do not say that lightly. I say it today because we do not get very many opportunities of raising these issues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
    <P>I support the sentiments expressed in the D&aacute;il last week by Deputy Perry, our party spokesman on the marine, by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and by Deputy Donovan, standing behind the Minister of State this morning. I support their attitudes to this Bill, which as a Deputy representing the most significant sea fishing area in the country in Donegal, I condemn in the strongest terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for State, Deputy Gallagher, who was here last week and is here today, are presenting us with a classic pig in a poke. A Bill which they say merely consolidates existing legislation and rectifies deficiencies arising from some Supreme Court cases has been hijacked and turned into a lethal instrument directed at an already beleaguered fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We need hardly be surprised at this development. This Government is comprised of Members who have been too long in office and have lost touch with the needs of ordinary people, and of the fishing communities. They have long since ceded their authority to their ever-willing civil servants who are content to rule from afar. The Minister has been flying short-lived kites on a variety of subjects in recent years but this Bill is the proof that he is unfit to hold his particular office. His self-righteousness regarding this Bill, bolstered by his new friends in the shadows, the senior civil servants, is an advertisement for a change in Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is an esteemed constituency colleague of mine and as a man who worked in the fishing industry for many years, I can scarcely believe he is content to put his name to this Bill which, if enacted, would represent a scandalous attack on his constituents and mine. I do not know what amendments will be put forward but if the Bill passes as now proposed it will have serious implications.</P><Col N="1832"/>
    <P>This Bill is founded on principles of coercion, criminalisation and disproportionality. Among other things it is an attack on civil liberties and fair play. It smacks of an Administration which has lost its way and views the fishing industry as an implacable enemy rather than a valuable and vital part of the economies and communities of the coasts.</P>
    <P>One might say that in dealing principally with offenders against fisheries laws, this Bill should be of no concern to the law-abiding majority. Why should we be so bothered about law-breakers? We must of course have severe penalties for offenders who by their behaviour threaten our precious fish stocks. However, fishery offences differ vastly in terms of seriousness. By all means, severe penalties must be available for the most severe and particularly repeated offences, but many of the transgressions involved in fisheries cases are technical offences, where a fisherman is outside the framework of legislation by a very small margin. The ever-increasing complexity of the regulatory framework also means the vast majority of fishermen would find it difficult to remain aware and abreast of every detail of the thousands of pages of Irish and EU regulations generated in seeking to deal with the problem of managing fisheries.</P>
    <P>I see no evidence whatsoever that this Bill makes any distinction between the seriousness of many of the categories or indeed scale of offences involved. It holds no water to say that these are only maximum penalties and the courts can decide the level of the fines, possibly well within the maximum. In an area so arcane and complex, it behoves us as legislators, with the assistance of our experts in the Department, to devise a comprehensive table of on-the-spot fines outside the criminal system, graded upwards to reach into the criminal system for serious offences only.</P>
    <P>It is a very disturbing aspect of this Bill that minor offences will be criminalised. That will have serious implications for anyone caught, because acquiring a criminal record for such a minor infringement will probably interfere with one&rsquo;s civil liberties. If one wants to visit relations in the United States, where many Irish people have sons and daughters, what does one do if one acquires a criminal record? One will probably not be allowed into the United States. There will be very serious implications if every infringement is to be treated as a criminal act. The Minister and his officials must look at this issue and ensure there will be a scale of offences, otherwise every fisherman who infringes the regulations even in the most minor way will be categorised as a criminal.</P>
    <P>Instead of addressing the real issues surrounding fisheries issues, this Bill takes a classic law and order, throw-the-book-at-them approach, all brawn and no brains. There is no reflection in the Bill of the concern to keep Irish legislation in line with EU norms and standards, to have a truly level playing field. There is no hint anywhere in <Col N="1833"/>this Bill that what we may be instituting here is a set of extreme measures to cover up the fact that the Common Fisheries Policy is deeply and fundamentally flawed and needs not merely patching up but root and branch reform. There is no hint in any of the thinking in this Bill that the Government or the Department is willing in any meaningful sense to highlight that the basis for many of the EU regulations we are proposing to uphold at such cost is unworkable, unfair, counterproductive and widely discredited.</P>
    <P>This legislation gives legal immunities to people everywhere and reduces the reasonable right of redress available. I know that in at least one recent case, had this Bill been in force, the immunity from legal action and the very deficient conditions for notifying skippers or owners of matters relating to authorisations would have led to a serious miscarriage of justice. The Minister is aware of this case.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Bill is very negative. I fully agree with the stand taken by our party spokesperson on the marine that if the Bill goes through, it will be a priority of his to have it repealed or amended in Government. My view reflects those of all the fishermen I am familiar with in my constituency and the views of other organisations from different parts of the country who have been in touch with me, as I am sure they have been with other Members of this House and of the Government, and with backbenchers on the Government side of the House. Listening to those backbenchers who have spoken, I will be surprised if the Bill goes through in its current form. For the sake of what is left of the Irish fishing industry, let us hope it does not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to express my sympathy with the families in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Wexford constituency whose members died as a result of the tragic accident involving the <i>Pisces. </i>Can the Minister say if there any plans to introduce new regulations or legislation with regard to the destruction of such unseaworthy boats? The Minister might address that issue at the conclusion of his reply.</P>
    <P>As many Members present will be aware, I represent the Dublin North-East constituency, which includes the port of Howth. In my lifetime, the fishing community members there, though sadly depleted in numbers, especially in recent years, were looked up to and admired as decent, hardworking and upright people. They earned their living the hard way and eked out a livelihood from the sea. They are a tough, proud and honourable people and I am proud to represent them.</P>
    <P>There were references here to Ministers being out of touch. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is not out of touch. Any time I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to meet the fishermen in Howth he was always available and always on top of his brief. He was out there recently and launched a decommissioning in <Col N="1834"/>Howth. While I do not want to pester him with questions I make the point that when one decommissions a boat there is a crew involved that one cannot throw to the wind and forget about. Are there plans afoot to put some package together for crews on the trawlers?</P>
    <P>I am saddened at the thrust of the provisions contained in Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, which is directed at the people I know and respect in the fishing industry. When I read of regimes for fines of up to &euro;200,000 for some offences, provision for the confiscation of vessels, increased powers and, as Deputy McGinley has rightly said, legal immunity for various officials and provision for the firing of live rounds of ammunition into fishing vessels, I ask what are we about. I find it hard to square that with the conditions faced by the fishing community that I know and represent.</P>
    <P>I and everybody else appreciate that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has a difficult job. Nobody would dispute that, we are well aware it has a difficult job to do. The Naval Service likewise has a very difficult task. It is vital that proper controls be put in place to conserve fish stocks and it is equally vital to have penalties for wrongdoers. Nobody would argue with that. I also fully appreciate that this legislation has to cater for vessels other than Irish vessels operating in the fishing waters around our coast, which account for the vast bulk of the fish caught in our waters.</P>
    <P>That various fishing stocks around our coast are severely depleted is a fact, confirmed by fisheries scientists in Ireland and the international scientific body which advises the European Union. We must have regard to the urgent need to conserve these stocks for the future &mdash; which is commonsense &mdash; for our fishermen and for the health of our marine environment. It is vital that we all agree we are all facing the threats that diminished fish stocks bring in economic, social and environmental terms. The Department, fishermen, scientists and all in this House have a responsibility to ensure that sustainable harvesting of our fish resources is the keystone of all our concerns.</P>
    <P>We have had some notable progressive steps in this regard in the lifetime of this Government. The re-establishment of the reduced Irish Box was achieved by a strong consensus by all concerned and concerted action by this Government and industry representatives working together.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the enormous difficulties faced by the fishing industry. The vast increases in fuel prices, about which I get complaints on a regular basis from the fishermen in Howth, which are a critical determinant of viability for fuel-hungry fishing vessels, have made survival in business a difficult task during the past 18 months to two years. The introduction of days at sea limits has particularly affected vessels operating from Howth where 15 vessels have been tied up for the past couple of years. The harbour master had a <Col N="1835"/>meeting with me a couple of weeks ago on the issue of how to dispose of these boats. That gives some indication of the way the industry is going. The days at sea limits have caused severe hardship and have been largely counterproductive. There is no other business where that type of regulation &mdash; where they can only open so many days a year or so many hours per day &mdash; would be inflicted on people.</P>
    <P>The major increases in harbour charges in State-owned fishery harbours such as Howth have added considerably to the overheads of fishing vessels. Ever more complex regulations as regards the fishing effort, completion of days at sea books, technical measures, boat standards, recording of catches, logbook requirements, advance notice of landing requirements, closed areas and more have made life extremely difficult if not impossible for fishermen. Some of the fishermen tell me they would need an accountant with them at sea on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>We are advised that the rationale behind the Bill is to correct deficiencies in the existing law due to a number of Supreme Court cases. That is a reasonable objective. We are further advised that this Bill is to consolidate the various legislation which has been enacted since 1959 in respect of fisheries. Were these objectives what the thrust of the Bill contained, I would have no criticism of it whatsoever. I must confess to being deeply disturbed by many of the provisions in the Bill. I will not accept that my concerns are those of the uninformed. I have carefully considered and taken advice on many of the measures with which I have a problem. Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan who spoke earlier met with a group of backbenchers and we signed the motion to which he referred. He has a good overall knowledge of the industry and I thank him for his efforts and the valuable advice we obtained from him.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that we cannot have a table of graded offences related to the extent of the various transgressions catered for in the Bill. I do not accept the logic that says we are only setting maximum fines of up to &euro;200,000 per offence and leave it to the wisdom of the Judiciary not to impose this level of fine, much as I have regard for the judicial branch. It is unfair to fishermen and judges to put them in that position. I cannot accept it is beyond the ingenuity of those drafting the Bill to come up with a prescribed set of sanctions to deal with the severity of the offence involved, including administrative on-the-spot fines of an appropriate level. Repeated transgressions or very serious offences must be dealt with severely but this Bill is a bridge too far.</P>
    <P>I am deeply worried by the extent to which the Bill grants immunity from legal action to whole sets of public servants. That does not happen in any other area of which I am aware. I fully accept that these people are decent, hardworking and honest but they can make mistakes, as we all can, and it would be unwise in the extreme not to give <Col N="1836"/>aggrieved citizens the right to proper redress. That is democracy and that is how democracy should work. That lorry drivers and buyers who cannot be expected to know if any particular consignment of fish is totally legal in all respects are left liable under this legislation to prosecution and fines of up to &euro;5,000 seems crazy and daft. I am not happy at the diminution in the powers of oversight of the Minister which is contained in the Bill regarding the position of fisheries control manager and that person&rsquo;s reporting to the Secretary General of the Department. I cannot contemplate the inclusion of a clause in the Bill which would allow the firing of guns into fishing vessels. No legislation is in place to follow up and investigate whether such action was appropriate.</P>
    <P>We have received very contradictory advice as to the urgency of passing this Bill. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, told us that it is imperative to allow Ireland to comply with EU law. However, as Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan stated earlier, information from the European Commission and MEPs not just from this country suggests that this is not the case. However, we must also appreciate that there must be equity between control regimes operating in all EU countries. We must also be constructively critical and say that little in the present operation of the Common Fisheries Policy commends itself and reform of that policy is urgently needed. We need a sense of partnership and mutual respect among stakeholders, which is not evident in this Bill as presented. I strongly urge the Minister of State and the Department to promote a sense of partnership and shared interest among all parties which would obviate the need for many of the most excessive provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I note that the development of regional advisory councils in which Irish fishing organisations play a leading part is a positive first step towards a partnership approach to fisheries management if it is allowed to develop. I welcome the fact that our good friend, Lorcan &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide of the IFPO, is chairman of the Irish Sea working group of the RAC relevant to us on the east coast. The fishermen are very fortunate to have such fine representatives. Some members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources visited Castletownbere Harbour and various operations in that area. I would be proud to have those people represent any organisation.</P>
    <P>As for the capacity to enforce fisheries law, I note the prosecution and fining two weeks ago of the owner of a Howth-based vessel, the <i>Fragrant Cloud</i>, in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and the detention of another vessel in that port. I also note the deep cross-party concerns over this Bill expressed by members of the Oireachtas joint committee in recent weeks and I commend that committee on its independent scrutiny of the Bill. I commend the committee&rsquo;s Chairman, who is very diligent. He is from Cork and also visited those ports in Cork. I thank him for his work. I <Col N="1837"/>am disappointed that this Bill has appeared before us unchanged from the version which was before the committee. I believe that the Department has engaged in seriously misleading scare tactics to ensure that this is so.</P>
    <P>This Bill needs to be fundamentally reappraised in many respects and will meet further scrutiny from Members of this House, the elected legislators. I strongly urge that we take sufficient time and care to reconstruct this Bill in a considered and appropriate manner and we should be given the space to do so. I take some solace from a letter sent by the Taoiseach to the Oireachtas joint committee a few weeks ago indicating that significant amendments to the Bill would be accepted in the course of its further passage through these Houses and it is only on that basis that I very reluctantly will support its proceeding to a further stage. As Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan said, this is about fair play and people&rsquo;s livelihoods. The least people can expect is a fair crack of the whip. We are not in the business of beating them into the ground or putting them out of business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to speak on an issue that affects the marine sector. We debate very many issues in this House and, to borrow a phrase from a well known broadcaster, this island nation does not deal with marine issues too frequently and it is often regarded as the Cinderella sector particularly when compared with the way we have treated agriculture since we joined the European Union, or Common Market as it was then, in 1973. The history of the issues we are discussing goes back to the early 1970s when the negotiating regime under which Ireland became a member of the Common Market basically short-changed fishermen here. In the following decades, successive Governments of all political hues have contributed to downgrade and prevent the proper development of the marine sector and the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In the early 1970s the fishing industry was very underdeveloped and the agriculture sector was much more economically important. To get a good deal for Ireland we ceded many fundamental rights to the other member states. We did not take the opportunity in further negotiations when very large maritime countries, like Spain and Portugal, were conducting their accession talks, to reopen the Irish issue. Over the three decades that have passed while the fishing sector has grown and developed, this has always been in a half-spancelled way and never to the full potential that an island with such rich fishing grounds in its hinterland would have expected.</P>
    <P>The lack of regard for the marine sector in general and for fisheries in particular has remained a feature of the present Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Government. A distinguished former leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, Mr. Charles Haughey, wanted the marine sector <Col N="1838"/>raised to Cabinet rank. On the coming to office of the current Administration, it has been subsumed into a hydra-like Department with many heads. The marine sector is very much the poor relation in that broad-ranging Department headed by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. That the word &ldquo;marine&rdquo; was not included in the Department&rsquo;s title at its outset and needed to be grafted on when this was pointed out gave an indication of the worth placed on the marine and the fishing industry by the current Administration.</P>
    <P>It is unarguable that the lead Minister in that Department, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has really abandoned this sector and views his job as dealing with the other broad areas of natural resources, energy, communications and the various semi-State bodies under his remit. He has not taken a hands-on or direct interest other than a destructive interest in the marine sector. While I do not say this simply because he is sitting before me &mdash; I had intended saying it in any event &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is extremely knowledgeable on the sector. My constituency dealings with him have shown him to be incisive and caring. The truth, however, is that he has been shafted on this Bill. He may say what he likes when he stands up in the House, but I know his heart is not in it and that he does not want the Bill before the House in its current shape and form. He was given a poisoned chalice the moment he walked into the Department, being the recipient of positions negotiated in advance of coming into it and having to sort out difficulties not of his making, without the benefit of a seat at Cabinet to give him the leverage to tackle the jobs foisted on him. It is important to say that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is surrounded by grand farce which continues. I listened to Government Members&rsquo; contributions today and one after another they said they disagreed with the contents of the Bill. Having said that they do a little public wrestling with their conscience and a little sabre rattling, or rather penknife rattling, and suggest that if it is not changed in Committee they might vote against it. That is as likely to happen as lightning is likely to strike the dome of this building within the next two minutes.</P>
    <P>It is farcical to have a Bill before the House that clearly does not command the support of the significant majority of Deputies. Dare I say it, since he cannot say it, I do not believe it has the support of the Minister of State. He must say what he must, but I know, even from his comments on Second Stage, that his heart is not in the proposals. The penknife rattling &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il version of sabre rattling &mdash; has been proven fatuous as the Members on the Government side of the House have already voted twice to introduce the legislation on 17 November.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for Deputies O&rsquo;Donovan, Martin Brady and others, whom I believe know this Bill is so flawed it should not be before us. I have some sympathy with them that they were whipped through the lobbies on 17 <Col N="1839"/>November to support it because that is how the whipping system works. However, they should spare us the public wrestling of conscience on this matter and stand firm on their principles and ensure that what is flawed and wrong legislation is not introduced into the House to take up the time of the House inappropriately. I agree with colleagues on the Government side who spoke with regard to the urgency attached and attributed to the Bill by the Department. The view from Brussels and our Members of the European Parliament is that there is no such urgency. Why then must we deal with what is by common acceptance flawed legislation?</P>
    <P>Let me give the House a backdrop to the legislation from the perspective of my home county, one I know the Minister of State is familiar with and to which he is sympathetic. It is a reality that needs to be spelled out. Kilmore Quay and its hinterland is on its knees. That phrase has been repeated to me again and again over past months. Five or six years ago the area had enormous potential to develop and expand. New vessels were being bought and owners wanted to expand the fleet. However, decisions made by Government have struck a range of body blows to the people of Kilmore Quay.</P>
    <P>People may be familiar with the scallop fishermen fiasco when the Sea Fisheries (Conservation and Rational Exploitation of Scallop) Regulations 2005, SI 245 of this year, was introduced into the House. It has been a devastating blow to the scallop fishermen of Wexford. The scallop processing industry was established 30 years ago in the south east. It is not a multinational industry in receipt of massive IDA grants and subsidised to bring in jobs, nor is it an industry that moves on somewhere else when it can get cheaper labour. It is an indigenous industry harvesting a natural resource. It provided valuable local employment on ship and on shore in processing. The industry was worth &euro;50 million, a not insignificant sum to a coastal community.</P>
    <P>On account of the decision taken in July 2004 in Brussels, an agreement made by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, without consultation with the fishermen or processors involved, we faced a situation earlier this year where people&rsquo;s livelihood was simply taken from them. I will not go into the details of that because the House has heard them from me on the Adjournment debate and elsewhere. In fairness to the Minister of State, he recognised the calamity facing the sector and brought in Padraic White to review the decommissioning process that could be used, because we could not wind back the clock on the calamitous decision made when the scallop fishery was sold out in Brussels. He has negotiated a support package for the boat owners, but we now need a package for the crewmen of those boats who have been left high and dry.</P><Col N="1840"/>
    <P>Within my community I deal with the banks that are foreclosing on some of these families and these proud hard-working dedicated men who have never known unemployment. One skipper, with his skipper&rsquo;s ticket, skippered a boat with several crew members and earned a decent living. Now, however, he works part-time in a local firm on a salary slightly above the minimum wage. That is the calamity facing and being endured by scores of families in County Wexford. Their case needs to be heard and addressed.</P>
    <P>We deal badly with fishermen in legislation. They are deemed by the Revenue to be share fishermen and, therefore, self-employed. I dealt with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act when it went through the House. Under that Act the same individuals are deemed employees. I asked a parliamentary question of the Minister of Finance asking him to explain why the same individuals should be treated differently for different legislation. The response was that they are deemed to be what they are appropriately deemed to be by any individual legislation. Therefore, they can be relabelled at will. On account of the fact that these men are deemed to be self-employed, they are not entitled to capital allowances. The boat owners can get those allowances, but they cannot. They are not entitled to social welfare and some of them are in deep trouble because of how they are dealt with and treated. The whitefish men and the processors also feel the pinch. This is an economic crisis that is squeezing the life blood out of people who a few short years ago envisaged themselves as economically prosperous and with a great future. We have a responsibility to do something about the situation.</P>
    <P>That is the backdrop to this legislation. Talk about adding insult to injury instead of asking how we can assist a community under enormous pressure because we have to make some decisions. I know from my background in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that we must have sustainability and I am as in favour of that principle as anybody. We must protect a resource that cannot be overfished because otherwise it will not be viable in the future. However, we can do this in a rational way. Above all else, we can do it in a way that shares the burden equally. Irish fishermen should carry the same burden as their EU colleagues and friends. They should not have to carry twice the burden because they comply with the various regulations, or because of a psychological attitude that the marine sector is of less value than other sectors. It would be amazing for such an attitude to exist among an island race.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss a few aspects of the Bill before the House, I would like to use some of the time available to refer to the issue of safety, which is close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart. We need to put in place safety systems which will prevent a recurrence of a crisis and tragedy of the nature that was inflicted on a community in my constitu<Col N="1841"/>ency of Wexford following the sinking of the <i>Pisces</i>. The terrible calamity that was endured by the victims&rsquo; families, to whom I extend my absolute sympathy, was revisited this week. In one case, a family was tragically bereaved by the death of people from three generations of it. We cannot do anything to restore those who died in that incident to life, but we can provide to the best of our ability that a regime is in place to ensure such a tragedy does not happen again. This House is accustomed to introducing strong laws in circumstances of this nature, but it also needs to ensure that the laws are enforced so they are complied with. I hope the assurances which were given in this regard by the Minister of State earlier this week can be fulfilled. An adequate inspectorate needs to be established to ensure an awful tragedy like the sinking of the <i>Pisces</i> &mdash; I am aware of the depth of pain that continues to be endured by the families directly involved in that case &mdash; is not visited on another community.</P>
    <P>Given that we do not know what the final shape of the Bill before the House will be, it may be somewhat vacuous to speak about some aspects of it. In his opening speech, the Minister of State resiled from some of the Bill&rsquo;s most contentious principles. Should Deputies refer to the Bill, as published, or would we be better advised to consider the potential amendments to it? I used to think such an approach, which involves introducing a Bill but then altering it substantially on Committee Stage, was the unique preserve of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who seems to graft new sections into legislation on the hoof, as ideas occur to him. I did not think other Ministers shared the level of brilliance of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, which enables him to amend legislation on an hourly basis. I was under the impression that more normal Ministers like to have the completed legislation in reasonable shape before they present it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think this legislation will be a different kettle of fish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be a different kettle of fish. I hope it will be no kettle of fish at all &mdash; I hope it will be a big cauldron of fish for my community. Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan is right to suggest that the final version of this legislation will be substantially different to the Bill before the House. Why is the House debating a Second Stage Bill that has no meaning? How can I comment in detail on the sections of the Bill if it is likely that they will be removed by the time the legislation is passed? Is it not a farcical way to abuse the scarce time of the House? We are all aware that additional time is needed if many other Bills are to be discussed on the floor of the House. It is not right to expect Members to talk about a Bill that will be changed anyway. The legislation will be amended because it is wrong, <Col N="1842"/>as it is currently drafted. The criminalising of working men, as envisaged in this Bill, is wrong.</P>
    <P>I was responsible some years ago for introducing a Bill that provided for a system of graded penalties. That aspect of the legislation was founded on a simple maxim &mdash; the penalty must fit the crime. One cannot put in place a draconian penalty that does not change regardless of the extent to which the legal threshold has been crossed. I do not accept the imposition of a disproportionate sledgehammer approach to the issue of fines. If certain administrative processes are in place in other jurisdictions, we have to ensure they change their processes to mirror our processes, or that we change our processes to mirror their processes. We cannot have one rule for us and a different rule for others. If the owners of Irish vessels are prosecuted in the Circuit Court, their gear and catch will be automatically confiscated under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the fisheries sector have suggested a reasonable approach to this legislation. I would like to highlight the four points made by the organisations in question. First, they have proposed that the Bill should provide for administrative and graded sanctions, which is reasonable. Second, they have suggested that the section of the Bill providing for the appointment of a seafood control manager needs to be deleted. I would like to hear more details, before this Bill is passed on Second Stage, of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to establish a new agency. Third, the organisations have argued that the automatic confiscation of gear and catch, which will apply only to Irish vessels, should be made discretionary for all vessels. Fourth, the representatives of the fisheries sector have called for the removal of the provision in the Bill that will allow firearms to be used against fishing vessels, a point that has already been conceded by the Minister of State. The provision in question could not be used because it would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>I wish I had more time to debate these issues. I hope I have made a strong and forceful case for the maritime community of Kilmore Quay in my home county of Wexford. Communities like Kilmore Quay need assistance rather than draconian legislation of the kind that is proposed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; m&oacute;r-&aacute;thas orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an mBille seo. Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom chomhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir. I have deliberately congratulated the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in response to some comments which were made earlier today. He has recognised in this Bill that the consolidation of a great deal of legislation relating to the fisheries sector and marine matters is long overdue. I hope the Minister of State will continue his efforts to consolidate all aspects of the legislation in this area, which is a mess. Deputy Howlin believes the House has not considered such legislation on many occasions, but it seems there is a great deal <Col N="1843"/>of it to be consolidated. The Minister of State&rsquo;s great knowledge of and commitment to the fishing industry have been recognised by every speaker. Deputy Howlin claimed Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers have been rattling their sabres or penknives in this regard. While they have expressed some concerns, my party&rsquo;s Deputies have shown a high level of consistency in their approach to this matter. I question the Labour Party&rsquo;s consistency, however. It is right that Deputy Howlin is terribly concerned about people in County Wexford who are involved in the fisheries sector, but we need to be concerned about all the fishermen in the industry. Almost all the Irish MEPs, including all my party colleagues in the European Parliament, signed a letter expressing their objections to the Bill before the House and the thinking behind it. Given that the only Irish MEP who did not sign the latter was a Labour Party MEP, Proinsias De Rossa, it is legitimate to ask whether the Labour Party is adopting one approach in this House to suit the fishermen in its Deputies&rsquo; constituencies and a different approach in the European Parliament.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised a legitimate question that the Labour Party Members should reflect on before they make any further attempt to berate my colleagues for their consistent and honest stand.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill before the House in so far as it consolidates the existing legislation in this area. I refer particularly to health and safety regulations. I have spoken previously about the difficulties I have encountered in trying to implement the requirements of various Acts which have been amended on many occasions. I have had to examine three or four separate Acts to try to ascertain what is required. The first rule to be followed when passing legislation is to ensure it is clear, unambiguous and capable of being understood by everyone. One should not <Col N="1844"/>have to refer to three or four Acts to determine what is required. Deputy Howlin claimed that the House has not considered legislation on this topic very often, but I remind him that since the House passed the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, it has also passed the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1962, the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1978, the Fisheries Act 1980, the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1983, the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1994 and the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003. We have other legislation affecting the marine area including Acts to implement the EU requirements, protocols and conventions referred to earlier, the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2000, Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 and the Oil Pollution at Sea (Civil Liabilities and Compensation) (Amendment) Act 2003. In addition, we are affected by many international and EU rules, including the Merchant Shipping Acts. I mention those Acts to illustrate the difficulty facing stakeholders, the fishermen trying to earn their living from fishing and those engaged in maricultural, aquaculture and various related businesses, in operating safely, complying with the law and regulations.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on getting to grips with this and trying to rectify matters. We can considerably simplify matters. I welcome his efforts to that end in this Bill. He is repealing provisions in 14 Fisheries Acts and five other Acts. That sounds ludicrous but it is a fact. It is crazy to still have to refer to the Fisheries (Ireland) Act of 1845. We should get real about this business, move in the modern area and deal with it.</P>
    <P>Many people have painted not so much a romantic picture but a picture of bustling quaysides and hundreds of people working in the fishing industry. It can be compared to working on the land. Those days are long gone. With the advent of modern technology, and handling facilities, there is a different way of doing the job and a more professional approach. There is not the same drudgery to the work and we will never go back to the manual input characteristic of this industry, any more than we will do in farming. That must be realised. It is grand to paint that picture of the industry 20 or 30 years ago but those days are gone and we need to move on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expression of the need to avoid unnecessary verbiage. It is mentioned several times in the explanatory memorandum. The dictionary definition of &ldquo;verbiage&rdquo;, which I checked to be sure, is &ldquo;the excessive number of words used to express an idea&rdquo;. It appears, and I mentioned this previously, that those working in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel must be paid by the word in drafting legislation or there must be some incentive for them to use 20 words where one would suffice. We get very complicated material here. The Bill is complex in many ways, probably because of the effort at consolidation but that must be dealt with.</P><Col N="1845"/>
    <P>I confessed to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher that my preference is trout fishing in the lake at the head of the Black Valley or the Paps Mountains or on the Sullane River in Macroom. I have a son who has a 30 ft to 40 ft boat and fishes wrecks 30 miles or 40 miles out. Therefore I am fairly <i>au fait</i> with the industry particularly from the leisure side.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the dangers associated with this industry and the need for safety provisions. Several speakers mentioned the horrible tragedy that was resurrected recently by coverage of the court case. I heard one or two Deputies comment on it and it occurred to me that they did not take much notice of the topic because it had already been acted upon here. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, enacted 18 of the 20 recommendations of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. The only two outstanding issues relate to the insurance of small boats under 40 ft and to compiling a register of small boats. The Minister of State has dealt with the fines issue and the need for floatation devices and so on. There was considerable grumbling by some stakeholders at the introduction of those measures. I recall my son complained about them when they were announced. I also heard him complain about the requirement to spend 12 weeks in the inner harbour with his boat before he got his skipper&rsquo;s licence or was officially allowed to take it out further. However, I welcome all these requirements. It is essential to have safe practice and procedures in place.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that commercial fishing is a hazardous job. The wearing of safety gear at times can almost be a hazard in itself in the same way as the wearing of a safety harness when aloft on a construction site can be an impediment at times, but that must to be worked around. I welcome the commitment to safety and to moving forward in that respect.</P>
    <P>The importance of our fishing industry is beginning to be recognised. I agree with Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s suggestion that the industry was not as such sold off as traded off for benefits in agriculture. We are only beginning to realise that. There was a reluctance on the part of members of the older generation to eat fish because of the religious requirement that it should be eaten on Fridays. The industry has had to cope with considerable baggage that was a disincentive in terms of selling fish but that has all changed. It is now recognised that this industry is an important asset. Too often we hear people say that we have no natural assets; we have some of the best rivers and the best seas and we must exploit them in a responsible fashion. That is what much of this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>Every time an issue such as this arises, some groups will take a stance against it. I speak as one of the few politicians who publicly said at the time, when I was the chairman of a trout fishing club, that I agreed with introduction of the rod licence. We all know the history of that. I was <Col N="1846"/>trying to foresee what might happen. In hindsight I was correct in saying what I thought would happen. Because the State did not have money to plough into buying fisheries and to improve inland fisheries people fought against that proposal. It was mainly well established club members who led the protest. There were 150,000 casual anglers and the vast majority of those have no place to fish because of the stance that was taken at that time. Irrespective of where one travels in the south west throughout Cork and Kerry, and I am sure this is also true of other regions, one sees signs displayed with the name of an angling club and the words &ldquo;fishing preserved&rdquo;, and even if a permit is available it will be only for fly fishing. That was the outcome of the decision not to pursue the introduction of a rod licence where the State would have a great input, could buy up the interests and facilitate anglers by making banks of rivers available and so on and compensating the landowners. It was shortsighted and we made mistakes.</P>
    <P>Any legislation will give rise to conflict with the primary stakeholders. It is evident in terms of the most endangered species, the salmon fishermen. I work very much with the landlubbers, the salmon anglers. I understand where the sea fishery people are coming from and that fishing is their livelihood and that they could be put out of action in the same way as beet growers who were mentioned earlier. The same could happen in terms of fishing but there are conflict points. We must be courageous at times and admit that a proposal is the correct decision, that we must take it and support it. In doing so, we might offend some constituents from time to time, but we must be conscious of the need for preservation. Anglers were the first people to become conscious of that. Traditionally, after a sea angling competition there would be boxes of, not so much ling as they would be taken but, conger, dog fish and so on and tonnes of them would be dumped into the river after the weigh-in competition. That was the practice seven, eight or nine years ago, but that has all changed. Conservation officers were appointed in every club and now everything is weighed and returned to sea. That does not happen in commercial fishing unfortunately and despite the best efforts, undersized fish are caught and die before anything can be done about it. We all need to work together in that regard.</P>
    <P>I refer to Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, Deputy Martin Brady and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. They are on the side of people involved with the sea. They are working with these people and they know the background, history, culture and dangers involved. I would listen very carefully to their comments on this matter. I will add my comments as well. Our fishing assets are in the ownership of all the people, not just the fishermen or consumers, and we have a right to say what should be done with them. Even if people are landlubbers, so to speak, they have a <Col N="1847"/>right to add their comments, as long as it is done in a fair way.</P>
    <P>The correct use of this asset is becoming more important every day, especially, as has been said, with the demise of employment in agriculture. The sea can also be used for leisure and tourism purposes. There is enormous potential in this area, particularly in regard to inland fisheries, which was a shambles. Some ten years ago the Central Fisheries Board was examined in the Committee of Public Accounts. It was the worst organised group that ever came before us. I am pleased to say the employment of a central fisheries officer and other measures have changed things for the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has another Bill in hand that will deal with this area. I do not wish to focus too much on inland fisheries but I am sure the Minister of State would be the first one to tell me that inland and sea fishing are inextricably linked and that we must deal with them as a single topic. In the past we have dealt with the matter in a piecemeal fashion. Inland fishing is divided among coarse fishing, pike fishing, carp fishing, salmon fishing and trout fishing. They are all separate groups that are fighting their own corner and vying with each other to some extent, which does nothing for the overall good of the industry. We have a great asset and it will be diminished if we do not deal with it properly. We all have a responsibility to do what we can to encourage people to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>The constituent to whom I referred is Tom MacSweeney, who presents the &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; programme. He has done marvellous work that has raised people&rsquo;s awareness, particularly in the context of Cork Harbour. Modest people that we are, we describe it as the second best natural harbour in the world. We have not tried to claim the first position as we have with so many other areas, for example, sport. I disagree with Tom MacSweeney to some extent over the siting of industry in the harbour. There is plenty of room for everything. I earned my living on an island in the centre of the harbour for a long time before I was elected to the House.</P>
    <P>A second person to whom I wish to briefly pay tribute is Matt Murphy of Sherkin Island. The Sherkin Island marine station has done more to educate young people than any other single establishment or group, including the State. This facility is very much a voluntary effort. He has done Trojan work at a time when there was very little awareness of the need to protect species or the environment. The Minister of State referred to the intention to make the centre more prominent and to give it more facilities. Research on the potential of shellfish has been particularly important. He was doing this work before the rest of us bothered to get involved. We just kept catching the fish.</P>
    <P>It is not all doom and gloom. I referred to the experience and commitment of the Minister of <Col N="1848"/>State, Deputy Gallagher. With him in charge there is hope and potential for the industry. He will be caught in the firing line between commercial fishermen and rod anglers and in other areas. His knowledge will come to the fore. People of all parties accept what he says because of his expertise in the area. It has been said that he might be riding to orders on this one but I do not know if that is the case.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to section 28, other than to say in passing that nobody referred to the fact that the two largest fines have been reduced by at least 50%. Two fines are being reduced from &euro;500,000 to &euro;200,000 and from &euro;127,000 to &euro;100,000. Previous speakers may not have noticed this when reading the Bill. I do not have the expertise to comment further on this section nor do I have sufficient knowledge of the industry to discuss it in greater detail. I will leave that to Deputies Martin Brady and O&rsquo;Donovan. I will pay great attention to their comments. We must work together on this matter. I will finish as I started by expressing comhghairdeachas leis an Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy Gallagher, for the effort at consolidation in this Bill which has been ignored by so many people in the past, and his commitment to fisheries in general.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Boyle.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>In his opening contribution to this debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in referring to the waters off our coast, stated: &ldquo;[T]hey are European waters now whether one likes it or not.&rdquo; There are many involved in the fishing industry who would see this as a large part of the problem, not that fishermen from other member states are allowed fish in our waters, but that control over those waters has, as the Minister of State admitted, been effectively handed over to the European Union under the rubric of the discredited Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <P>This State has nominal sovereignty over 11% of EU fishing waters and yet Irish fishermen only take around 4% of the EU catch. It is a natural resource that has, or had, enormous potential. I say &ldquo;had&rdquo; because since 1973 not only have billions of euro in worth of fish been taken by foreign fleets with no advantage to the sector here, that free-for-all has resulted in the depletion of many of the species around our coast.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need, therefore, for stocks to be managed and conserved but the problem is that Irish fishermen feel that while other fleets have been responsible and are still responsible for the bulk of over-fishing, it is they who are being made to pay the main price. This explains the huge anger that exists among fishermen and fishing communities at what they perceive to be the attempt through the Bill to criminalise them. <Col N="1849"/>Other Deputies have detailed the massive discrepancies that will exist between the level of penalties imposed on Irish fishermen and their EU counterparts if this Bill is passed. That will only compound the discrepancy which already exists between the policing of Irish vessels and those from other states.</P>
    <P>When Commodore Lynch of the Naval Service spoke recently to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, he provided figures which show that the majority of the serious actions, including warnings and detentions, taken by the Naval Service against fishing boats are against Irish boats. This is despite the fact that around 60% of the larger fishing vessels operating in Irish waters are foreign vessels and that these are most likely to be involved in illegal practices.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>That belief is confirmed by the evidence of fishermen who observe these vessels in action and the ploys in which they engage to avoid detection. Even when they are boarded, there appears to be little the Irish Naval Service can do, as Commodore Lynch admitted to the Oireachtas committee. Not only is it difficult for the Irish Naval Service to monitor the quota given to foreign vessels, it is not even its role. In effect, this means that foreign vessels can operate with a large degree of impunity in Irish waters and that advantage will be further tilted in their favour by the introduction of the type of penalties against Irish fishermen proposed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister of State said &ldquo;There is an obligation on every Member and on the European Commission to ensure that we have a sustainable fishery and preserve resources for future generations&rdquo;. On the face of it that is true. However, how much concern did other member states or the Commission show during the 30 years that Irish fish stocks were subject to a virtual open season? It is only recently that they expressed concern. It appears the onus for preserving stocks is to be placed on Irish fishermen alone.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that Deputies Perry and Broughan agree the Common Fisheries Policy has been a total failure and is in need of an overhaul. My party argued this for a long time, just as we pointed out the manner in which Irish fisheries were sacrificed as part of a deal made on accession to the then EEC in 1973. I know other speakers made that point and several other related points. It is not too late to attempt to revoke that or at least engage in some damage limitation to ensure Irish fishermen are given priority in the future management of our fishing waters and that this State begins to exercise some sovereignty in this regard.</P>
    <P>I concur with calls from other Members for a full debate on the future of the Irish fishing industry. That debate must involve a root and branch examination of the terms under which Irish waters are mismanaged under the Common Fish<Col N="1850"/>eries Policy and the proposals for a new strategy from those involved in the sector. I suggest the first step should be the rejection of this legislation.</P>
    <P>As someone with a background entirely spent in the fishing industry, with the exception of a few years when I had to engage in activity regarding British occupation of part of our country and this political excursion for as long as it lasts, I must state I could be passionate and fired up about this issue. However, I felt that might cause a diversion to the backbench Deputies who stated they are particularly displeased and angry with this legislation. I want them to keep that anger until they vote on this legislation. I hope they will exercise it wisely.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. It is an important debate and should involve all Members of the Oireachtas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;including Members who do not represent areas near ports or coastal areas and not only those with a particular interest in the fishing industry and fishermen. I happen to live in Dublin North-Central which includes Dublin Port and Dublin Bay and, as such, I have an interest in marine and fishing issues. It is important we have a broad debate because the State&rsquo;s fishing industry belongs to the people and the people directly involved in the fishing industry must be supported by all Members of the Oireachtas. While I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill, I strongly oppose it because major issues arise.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a maritime country. It is an island nation with a strong, long and proud history of fishing and life on the sea and fishing is of major importance. We must also be conscious of the economic benefits of the fishing industry in modern-day life. That is why I state as an Independent Member of the Oireachtas that I will examine the objective and sensible proposals in the legislation. I will also examine the proposals and amendments that support fishermen, conservation and the development of the fishing industry as a whole. It is important to develop the fishing industry to the maximum potential of the people working in it in the interests of the tax payers and citizens of the country.</P>
    <P>We often forget about the difficulties, dangers and hazardous conditions faced by people in the industry, such as those caused by climate changes. We must have great respect and admiration for them. It is not a cushy number. It is a difficult job and good luck to them and their families in times when they benefit economically because they work extremely hard and take risks. We should not apologise for that in any way. Many people <Col N="1851"/>involved in the industry have lost their lives and we should not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the area of safety at sea. During recent days we saw the case involving the <i>Pisces</i>, the tragic deaths of people in Wexford, the suffering of the families and the situation of the owner of the boat. That case was horrific and sad. Did we learn lessons from it? As I speak, how many people are bringing out boats without proper life-jackets or taking the necessary safety measures? I know from visiting different parts of the country, such as beautiful parts of Galway or Kerry, one goes on boat trips and no one insists on the wearing of life jackets. That is unacceptable and I urge the Minister of State to take this issue on board when dealing with future legislation. We cannot allow more tragic deaths to occur.</P>
    <P>On the broader issue of fishing, we must listen to the people involved in the industry and that is why I am concerned about the legislation. No Department or Minister will progress without the support and consent of the people involved in the industry. If fishermen approach us, we must listen to their concerns and reflect them in the legislation. It is important we have a planned and well thought-out strategy on conservation. I strongly support my colleagues when they raise the issue of conservation and planning for the future. I know that is a concern for some people and rightly so.</P>
    <P>We must break the mindset from our history regarding illegal fishing. We had a tradition of being against the empire, which is perfectly understandable for a nation controlled by an imperial power. People fished illegally as a challenge to the empire. We have moved on from the days of rogue fishermen setting lines in the middle of the night and fishing illegally. It is time for a change in mindset. To ensure proper planning, conservation must be part of the broader agenda. Aspects of this Bill are directly connected to this point and I acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Society in general often ignores this issue. We must consider the role of fish and health issues in society. We need new creative ideas. We have a terrible situation of a massive cancer epidemic in society. This is obviously connected to diet and the modern way of life. Statistics show that the high rates of cancer represent an epidemic much worse than the TB epidemic in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. This is not accepted as a reality. A sensible strategy by the Department of Health and Children would recognise the importance of fish in the diet of Irish people. This is particularly true of oily fish in respect of heart disease, blood and cholesterol. Creative Ministers for Health and Children and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would recognise the need to focus on marketing and development. A planned campaign should encourage people to eat fish two or three times per week rather than once. A campaign on the value of fish is needed and I encour<Col N="1852"/>age the Minister not to price fish out of the market.</P>
    <P>Major concerns about this Bill must be acknowledged. The Dumping at Sea Act also refers to the proposed fill-in of 52 acres in Dublin Bay. I commend Dublin Bay Watch Limited for its campaign,which I support. I will continue the tradition of Mr. Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Broughan, attempted to defer the Bill. As party Whip I supported this, perhaps for different reasons to the other two Opposition parties. The Green Party&rsquo;s position on this Bill has nothing to do with opposition for the sake of it. As our party spokesperson has highlighted, we support this Bill in its intent and content. However, we find it hard to believe the Government supports it. Regular reports suggest disagreement between the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Several contributions from Government Deputies suggest faith in this legislation is not what it should be from a Government presenting a Bill to this House. While supporting this Bill on Second Stage, I fear the Bill we will see after Committee and Report Stages will be a different type of animal. That would be most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I come from an island and fishing background. My family history would have been irredeemably altered if my grandfather had not stayed for another drink and instead took his place on the ferry before the Arranmore boat disaster. I know the risks to which people engaged in the fishing industry are exposed. That has changed somewhat with the modernisation of our fleet. Unfortunately, a Cinderella industry has seen its modernisation occur at a time when the raw material for the fishing industry has been most damaged.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge overfishing in our oceans. When Ireland was a smaller fishing nation it was easier to blame other nations for the size of their fleet and their capacity to take our stock. It was easier to blame inefficiency and ineptitude of other governments for the Common Fisheries Policy, in failing to negotiate proper standards and quotas for our fishing industry. The reality is that the modern Irish fishing fleet contains too many large vessels that are, in conservation terms, vacuum cleaners. The 20 ft boat is no longer the mainstay of our fleet. If we are serious about sustaining fishing stocks and how the industry can sustain coastal communities around the country, we must acknowledge that Irish people take some responsibility for overfishing.</P>
    <P>The more we have modernised, the more we have moved away from the concept of the captain owner of a vessel. Many of those who benefit from the Irish fishing industry are not those who go out on boats and fish. They sit at home in citadels, wait for the fleet to come in and count the profits. With such distance between the nature <Col N="1853"/>and danger of the industry and the community that needs to benefit from the industry, questions must be asked on past legislation and how it can benefit people at which it is targeted.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate aspect of the need to rigorously enforce conservation measures for our fishing stocks is that it leads to confrontation between many in the fishing industry and those policing on behalf of the State. It is regrettable that the Irish Naval Service, which does an excellent job on fisheries protection, finds itself confronted by people who seek to bend rules, exceed quotas and gain a competitive advantage by challenging the forces of the State. That cannot be condoned by this House.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about a fishing industry of which we can be proud and developing that industry for the future, we must speak with one voice to ensure this happens. That said, I look forward with interest to the amendments if proposed by the Government. If they are of a number and type that changes the nature of this Bill, the strong support of the Green Party can no longer persist.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OllieWilkinsonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilkinson</NameTxt>
	<P>I come from Waterford, the historically famous port of Helvick and Dunmore East, adjacent to the Celtic Sea and a rich fishing ground. As we examine the fishing industry, it bears a resemblance to the agriculture industry in that it is difficult to attract young people to it. We realise the great danger associated with this hazardous occupation but I wonder if this is factored into legislation. In monetary terms this is a small but important industry. God be with the days when fish on Friday was set in stone. As in many other areas, change is prevalent in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputies Martin Brady and Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, who know the fishing industry well, on their contributions and the concerns they have raised. Why is the enactment of this Bill urgent? Two judgments of the Supreme Court, the Browne judgment of 2003 and the Kennedy judgment of 2005, have undermined the legal basis for implementing fishery law under the current Acts. The Commission is monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s performance on control and is likely to pursue the State in the European Court if we do not take action. This could result in financial penalties being imposed on the State, to be paid by taxpayers. France was recently fined &euro;2 million, with a continuing fine of &euro;57 million, in respect of enforcement failures.</P>
    <P>Many concerns exist about this Bill, mainly that the current fine structures should be replaced by administrative sanctions. Fines are too high and an independent control agency should be set up. The Navy should not have the power to fire at fishing boats and there is unequal treatment of Irish and foreign boats in the Bill. Attempts should be made to take these concerns on board. I compliment the Minister of State on his commitment to the fishing industry, not only in D&aacute;il <Col N="1854"/>&Eacute;ireann but also in Brussels and Strasbourg, where he represented the people of Connaught-Ulster with distinction. We are very lucky to have a man with his great knowledge of fishing handling this situation.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to modernise the legislative framework for sea fisheries. The principal Act currently in place was adopted in the mid-20th century and was subject to a number of amendments. It was designed for a sea fishing industry that primarily involved short trips by small Irish boats. The sea fishing industry has changed almost beyond recognition since then, in terms of the size of the fleet. It now includes many multi-million euro businesses with large Irish boats operating in far away regions and large non-Irish boats fishing in Irish waters. The latter often land their catches in Ireland and many Members will be familiar with the number of French vessels landing in Killybegs and Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>The industry is now substantially regulated at EU level, through the Common Fisheries Policy. In that context, the Bill is designed to fill a major gap in the Fisheries Act regarding the implementation of the EU common fisheries policy, following litigation which resulted in the impugning by the Supreme Court of certain secondary legislation for lack of cover in the current Acts. It is necessary to amend the legal framework to have regard for these realities and to modernise our systems and structures so that best practice in fishery management and control is implemented. The Bill represents a sound basis for progress. However it needs further work and I am confident the Minister of State will take my views and concerns on board before enactment.</P>
    <P>The regulation of the fishing industry must accommodate the small vessel as well as the enormous fish-processing boats that fish European waters. In this regard, I suggest a number of changes to the Bill. It must provide for administrative and graded sanctions and decriminalise fishery offences. According to EU data, 86% of all EU fisheries offences are now dealt with by way of administrative sanctions.</P>
    <P>The section relating to the seafood manager should be deleted as it is only a mechanism for resolving an internal Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources management issue, adds little or nothing to the provision of improved control and enforcement, lacks accountability and undermines and sidelines the role of the Minister. Should such a position be necessary, then a fully independent officer of a seafood control regulator should be established, with an appropriate appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>The automatic confiscation of catch and gear, which only applies to Irish vessels, must be changed to allow the issue to be decided at the discretion of the courts. The fines and penalties detailed in the Bill lack proportionality and must be reduced and changed. The underlining principle must be that only serious fisheries offences <Col N="1855"/>attract serious penalties. There is no reason the small fisherman should be put out of business because of a once-off indiscretion. Proportionality must be borne in mind when the issue of fines and penalties is being discussed.</P>
    <P>The provision on the use of firearms against fishing vessels must be deleted. In recent months we have seen what happens when firearms are used to solve disputes. We have spent more than 30 years, and some would say a great deal longer, trying to take firearms off the scene in Ireland, for many reasons. Great progress has been made and the use of firearms against fishing vessels should be deleted from the Bill. Emotions run high on the seas and tense situations might only be inflamed by the use of firearms. In society, we condemn the use and prevalence of firearms. We should try to curtail the prevalence of firearms rather than legislating for their use on fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to take on board my views and concerns. I am very grateful for the opportunity to comment on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Deputy Wilkinson&rsquo;s courtesy in agreeing to share his time with me. I welcome the opportunity to comment on this legislation and compliment and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for his work in this area.</P>
    <P>I will not rise to the lecture we got this morning about the motives of those of us who wish to speak on this legislation who do not live by the sea or who cannot see the sea from our front windows. It is very important that we take our role in the Parliament seriously and that all of us uphold that principle. I could easily be very insular and stay in Tallaght without worrying about anything else going on around me, but that is not the kind of parliamentarian I want to be. It is important that we all examine legislation and if we were to apply the same rules that have been suggested for Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers to the Opposition, there would not be a word out of them any day of the week. The earlier comments were a little unfair.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be flippant, but I can stand on the hill in my parish of Belgard and see Dublin Bay just as clearly as can Deputy Finian McGrath. My paternal grandfather died on the seas, so I have an interest in the area. Deputy Finian McGrath, in a very fair contribution, made the point that we are all consumers. He and other colleagues referred to eating fish and I come from a generation where fish on a Friday was very much a ritual. Some Members will know that I had a health scare six years ago, where I had serious heart surgery. I have taken my diet seriously since then, although perhaps I should have been taking it seriously all along, and my dietician tells me that if I am telling her the truth, she is happy. I agree with the serious point made <Col N="1856"/>by Deputy Finian McGrath because I have found that including fish in my diet has helped my health enormously. I try to have fish at least three times a week, if not more. I encourage others to include fish in their diet. My colleague from Dublin Bay, Deputy Finian McGrath has already made the point, which is an important and fair one in the context of this discussion, that we should promote Irish fish and I hope all Members will do so. My diet is relatively small but the point is a serious one.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the complimentary remarks concerning our colleagues, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Deputies O&rsquo;Donovan and Martin Brady. Their statements to the D&aacute;il and the brave and courageous manner in which they have taken on this debate indicates that they have a particular interest in the issue. Some Members will know that I am a near neighbour of Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan on the Fianna F&aacute;il corridor and have had many opportunities to talk to him and understand where he is coming from, given that we represent completely different kinds of constituencies. I made the point in a debate yesterday that it is good for Deputies, particularly new Deputies like me, to have the opportunity to share experiences and information with colleagues and there are a number of issues on which I have been able to take advantage of Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s skill and understanding. I hope when he has to tackle serious urban problems he will pick my brain and I will be happy to facilitate that. I have listened very carefully to what Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan and other colleagues have been saying. It is good that we can take the opportunity to show solidarity and to understand where they are coming from and to try to help to promote the views they are expressing.</P>
    <P>I suspect I do not have much time to deal with the concerns expressed about the legislation and I do not know if I will have an opportunity to do so in the future.</P>

   <Title>Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Second Stage.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is unable to be here owing to another commitment but I welcome this opportunity to bring the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004 before the House. The debate and discussions that have already taken place in the Seanad were constructive and helpful and the Minister tabled a number of amendments in response to concerns raised there. He also took the opportunity to insert a <Col N="1857"/>new Part in the Bill, Part 2, which provides for establishment of the property registration authority. This new authority will be responsible for the control and management both of the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry and for promoting registration of title to land. The explanatory memorandum has been updated to take account of the amendments made during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>On the substance of the Bill, it is beyond doubt that effective and efficient property registration structures and systems are essential requirements for a successful economy. There are several reasons for this. Registration of ownership of land confirms and underpins the owner&rsquo;s rights to use and enjoy that land. For example, it is necessary to be able to demonstrate good title to sell or transfer the land, whether the owner is trading up or down. This is important whether the owner is a private individual or a business enterprise.</P>
    <P>Having good title to land allows the owner to make use of the asset to borrow funds which, in the case of a company, may be needed to launch or expand a business enterprise or to diversify into another area of commercial activity. In the case of private individuals, remortgaging a property may be undertaken to extend a family home or to assist a family member to gain a foothold on the property ladder. Looked at from this perspective, it is clear that effective land registration systems have the capacity to contribute in a meaningful way to entrepreneurial and economic activity in the country.</P>
    <P>Efficient registration systems, by which I mean systems in which registration procedures are straightforward, delays are avoided and costs are kept to a minimum, also have the capacity to enhance national competitiveness by making the country a more attractive investment location within the international community. In this context, it is interesting that the World Bank has recently drawn attention to the importance of sound property registration systems as a means of improving the climate for business and enhancing business activity.</P>
    <P>The main aims of the Bill are to restructure and modernise land registration structures in the State, update and streamline the law relating to registration of deeds and reform the law relating to the registration of title to land. The new property registration authority will be a statutory body with a representative board on the lines of the existing Courts Service. The Minister&rsquo;s intention is that the composition of the new authority will bring stakeholder expertise to bear in the discharge of its functions. This new structure is intended to facilitate stakeholder involvement in the strategic management and modernisation of registry services, provide channels of knowledge of and feedback from the conveyancing and property sectors leading to increased responsiveness to customer needs and ensuring quality customer service, make commercial and business expertise available to the new authority to ensure cost-<Col N="1858"/>effectiveness in the provision of services, facilitate staff representation to ensure staff participation in the management of change within the new organisation and increase the visibility and profile of the property registration services.</P>
    <P>Part 2 contains provisions relating to establishment of the property registration authority, including its membership, functions and staffing. One of its main functions, apart from managing and controlling the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry, will be to promote and extend the registration of ownership of land. When the Registration of Title Act 1964 was enacted more than 40 years ago, hopes were high that registration of title in the Land Registry would gradually replace the Registry of Deeds system. Specific provision was made in section 24 of that Act for extending the compulsory registration system on a geographical basis. Subsequently, a 1969 ministerial order extended compulsory registration to counties Carlow, Laois and Meath.</P>
    <P>For whatever reason, no further extension of compulsory registration took place until the Minister made an order last September which has the effect of extending compulsory registration to counties Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath with effect from 1 April 2006. The result of inaction over several decades is that the new authority will face a considerable challenge in its task of achieving a decisive shift toward the registration of title system within a reasonable timeframe. This task is urgent for another reason, namely, that the Law Reform Commission has concluded that the comprehensive system of e-conveyancing to which we aspire can only operate in respect of registered land.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes the active involvement of all stakeholders, especially conveyancing and business interests, will be crucial to creating a climate which supports progress in this area. He intends in due course to request the new authority to address this particular challenge in its first strategic plan.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for establishment of the new authority, while section 10 deals with its functions. These include the management and control of the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry, the promotion and extension of the registration of ownership of land, the processing of applications under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No. 2) Act 1978 and the undertaking of research projects relating to the registration of land. The authority will also keep the Minister informed of progress on the registration of land and perform any additional functions conferred on it.</P>
    <P>Provisions relating to membership of the authority are contained in section 11. The authority will have 11 members, including a chairperson to be appointed by the Minister. Membership will include representatives of the Law Society, Bar Council and the staff of the authority. The section also deals with the resignation or removal of a member from the authority. Section 12 deals with <Col N="1859"/>the filling of vacancies, while section 16 deals with meetings of the authority.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, are standard provisions for this type of authority. Section 13 deals with membership of the Oireachtas or European Parliament. Section 15 deals with the disclosure of interests by members of the authority under section 14 and non-disclosure of confidential information.</P>
    <P>The appointment of specialist advisory committees, advisers or consultants is provided for in section 17. Such appointments can only be made with the approval of the Minister. This section also provides that the authority may engage contractors to provide such services as it considers necessary with the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the preparation and submission to the Minister of strategic plans by the authority, while section 19 deals with the making of other reports to the Minister. It is intended that such plans and reports shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the Minister may issue general policy directives to the authority on the registration of deeds or the registration of ownership of land or any other function of the authority. However, nothing in the Act can be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise control or power in specific cases being dealt with by the authority.</P>
    <P>The fees to be charged by the authority for its services are provided for in section 21. It provides that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by order fix the fees to be charged by the authority for its services. It provides that they shall not be fixed at a level which would produce an annual amount less than that required to meet the salaries, remuneration and other expenses of the authority. Fee income shall be paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for appointment of a chief executive, the delegation of functions and the carrying out of the functions of chief executive in his or her absence. It is intended that the current Registrar of Deeds and Titles will become the first chief executive of the new authority and this is provided for in subsection (9). Section 23 provides that the chief executive shall be the Accounting Officer for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts, while section 24 makes provision for attendance of the chief executive before Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>The appointment of staff to the authority is dealt with in section 25. Section 26 provides that every person who immediately before the establishment day was a member of the staff of the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds shall become a member of the staff of the authority on that day. Staff shall remain civil servants in the service of the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the transfer of land and other property to the authority on establishment <Col N="1860"/>day. It also provides that all records and documents held by the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds before establishment day will stand vested in the authority on that day. Sections 28 and 29 are transitional provisions relating to contracts and proceedings pending at establishment day.</P>
    <P>Section 30 is also a transitional provision relating to the validity of acts done prior to establishment day on behalf of the Registrar of Deeds and Titles.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill contains new provisions relating to the registration of deeds. The registration of deeds system, operated by the Registry of Deeds, provides for the registration of documents relating to land with a view to establishing priorities between documents dealing with the same piece of land. The act of registering a document does not in itself guarantee title to the land covered by that document. In this important respect, registration of deeds differs fundamentally from the registration of a title which, in effect, registers ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>The Registry of Deeds was established under the Registration of Deeds Act (Ireland) 1707 and many of the registry&rsquo;s current practices and procedures are still governed by that Act, and by other antiquated statutes dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The result is that the registry simply does not have the required margin of operational flexibility to respond adequately to the changed conditions of today. In short, there is now an urgent need to replace the current system with provisions more suited to modern conditions. This requires the outright repeal of the eight old statutes under which the Registry of Deeds still operates and their replacement with appropriate provisions geared to the changed conditions of today.</P>
    <P>At this point, it should be acknowledged that the Registry of Deeds has served this country well since its establishment in 1707. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the current Registrar of Deeds and the registry&rsquo;s staff for their work and commitment. Rather than replace the repealed statutes with equally detailed provisions, it is intended that the detailed registration and other formalities will be set out in general rules to be made under section 47. Where possible, the detailed provisions regarding deeds will correspond with those relating to the registration of title under the Registration of Title Act 1964. This will help the authority to ensure a coherent approach to the registration of both deeds and title.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is a standard provision that contains definitions of terms used in this Part. It should be noted that the definition of deed includes a reference to information in electronic or non-legible form which is capable of conversion to legible form. This is included in order to permit the computerisation of records and other data.</P>
    <P>Section 32 makes provision for a registry of deeds under the management and control of the property registration authority. Section 34 pro<Col N="1861"/>vides that a register of deeds, which may be in an electronic or other form capable of conversion into a permanent legible form, shall be maintained and that the form of this register shall be prescribed in general rules. Section 33 contains transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides that the application procedure, and the procedure by which registration is to be given effect, shall be prescribed in general rules. Section 36 changes the way in which applications for registration are to be recorded. In future, applications for registration will be allocated a serial number. Section 37 provides generally that the priority accorded to registered documents will be based on the serial number allocated under section 36. A deed which is not registered will continue to be void against a registered deed affecting the land concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is a technical provision which relates to memorials of deeds in cases where execution by grantees only is proved. The rectification of errors is provided for in section 39. The section is based on the corresponding section 32 of the 1964 Act. Section 40 deals with registration, or attempted registration, by means of a false deed.</P>
    <P>While section 34 provides for the keeping of a register of deeds, section 41 relates to the retention of other records by the Registry of Deeds. It provides for the keeping of records such as indexes in a prescribed form, including by electronic means. Section 42 provides for searches of records kept by the Registry of Deeds, while section 43 deals with the inspection, search and examination of such records. Section 44 provides for judicial notice to be taken of certified copies of entries in the register etc., including reproductions of documents and records kept in electronic format.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, the Registry of Deeds was required to maintain an index of lands. For whatever reason, this has not been done for almost 60 years. Section 45 deems the index to have closed on 31 December 1946. Section 46 deals with the closing of certain other records. The Registry of Deeds Act 1832 required that certain books be kept in parchment form. However, these books were not maintained during certain periods. The purpose of this provision is to deem the books to have been closed during the periods when they were not properly maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 47 is a key section of the Bill. It provides for the making of general rules by the registration of deeds and title rules committee established under section 63. As I mentioned earlier, the keeping of registers, forms of application etc., is governed by the old statutes. It is necessary to replace this detailed legislation with a mechanism which will allow the Registry of Deeds to operate in a flexible and efficient manner. It is proposed, therefore, to give the registration of deeds and title rule committee the task of making general rules which will take the form of regulations under the Act. Section 48 is a transitional pro<Col N="1862"/>vision relating to the priority and registration of deeds registered prior to commencement of Part 3 or to deeds lodged for registration before such commencement.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill contains a series of amendments of the Registration of Title Act 1964. These amendments are intended to clarify certain aspects of the law relating to the registration of title, to improve efficiencies within the Land Registry and to extend the registration of title system. In particular, they will provide the Land Registry with the means to develop and operate an e-conveyancing system.</P>
    <P>Section 49 amends certain definitions in section 3 of the 1964 Act. In particular, it substitutes an amended definition of register and inserts a new definition of index in order to facilitate computerisation of records. Both definitions will contain references to material &ldquo;kept in electronic or other non-legible form which is capable of being converted into a permanent form&rdquo;. It also provides for deletion of the definitions of &ldquo;local office&rdquo; and &ldquo;local registrar&rdquo; since the computerisation of registers will obviate the need to keep and maintain duplicates in local offices for inspection locally. In future, access to the registers will be available by electronic means.</P>
    <P>Section 50 substitutes a new section 7 in the 1964 Act and provides that the Land Registry will be under the control and management of the property registration authority. Section 51 amends section 23 of the 1964 Act. It responds to a recommendation by the Law Reform Commission to exempt lands covered by the Irish Church Act 1869 from the compulsory registration provisions of the 1964 Act. Following its consideration of practical problems arising in this area, the commission concluded that what was required was a provision that would absolve non-compliant owners from the obligation to register. This is the purpose of paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i>. These changes are in turn linked with the amendment in section 49 which deletes the reference to the Irish Church Act 1869 from the definition of the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 52 amends section 24 of the 1964 Act. It will permit extensions of compulsory registration, not only to specified geographical areas as at present, but also to specific categories of buildings or land. In addition, the Minister will be empowered to extend, by order, compulsory registration to dispositions other than sales or assignments of land. In short, the section provides the means of extending compulsory registration by means other than the geographical route set out in the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 53 substitutes a new section for section 25 of the 1964 Act. It provides that in cases where compulsory registration applies, the person acquiring the interest in land must register the change of ownership within six months of such acquisition. Section 32 of the 1964 Act is amended by section 54. It will enable the authority to amend errors originating in the Land <Col N="1863"/>Registry where it is satisfied the error can be rectified without injustice to any party.</P>
    <P>Increased use of digital maps will be important in the context of e-conveyancing and the Land Registry is undertaking a major project in this area. Section 55 substitutes a new section 84 in the 1964 Act which will allow the authority to use electronic or digitalised maps. Section 56 deals with the description and identification of registered lands and substitutes a new section for section 85 of the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 90 of the 1964 Act is amended by section 57, which widens the powers conferred by it to include the granting of a lease, easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i> in respect of property. The amendment also provides that the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall have powers previously conferred on the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of registers, maps and indexes will of necessity require changes to the inspection and searches of registers and maps. Section 58 amends section 107 of the 1964 Act to allow for inspection of material in the form in which it is stored or in a legible reproduction of it.</P>
    <P>Section 120 of the 1964 Act deals with compensation for error, fraud or forgery related to the Land Registry. Section 59 removes a reference in section 120 to the determination of a claim by the registrar, a matter that has been the subject of adverse comment by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has stated section 123 of the 1964 Act does not appear to apply to the granting of appurtenant rights such as an easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre. </i> The absence of these words of limitation would probably mean the easement or profit would last for the lifetime of the grantee only, which is obviously not the intention. This is remedied in section 60 which inserts three new subsections in section 123 of the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 61 is a new provision which will permit judicial notice to be taken of certified copies of entries in registers etc., including reproductions of documents and records kept in electronic format. Section 62 amends section 126 of the 1964 Act to take account of the new registration of deeds and title rules committee. The intention is that this new committee, which will replace the registration of title rules committee established under section 73 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936, will make general rules relating to both for the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>Part 5 deals with the new registration of deeds and title rules committee. Section 63 establishes the new committee to perform the functions assigned to it under sections 47 and 126 of the 1964 Act, while section 64 provides that it shall meet at least yearly and report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Schedule lists the enactments relating to the registration of deeds repealed by section 4. Part 2 contains a listing of provisions relating to registration of title also being repealed <Col N="1864"/>as a consequence of establishment of the property registration authority.</P>
    <P>While it addresses a range of structural and technical issues, the Bill is enormously important in the overall context of the registration of ownership of land. I commend it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael welcomes the introduction of this long overdue legislation. The review and reform of the systems of registration of title are badly needed. Land law, property law and conveyancing here are hugely complex and extremely archaic.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have been touting a major programme of reform of Irish land law and conveyancing law in conjunction with the Law Reform Commission. The Law Reform Commission, under Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, is an agency of great integrity and achievement. It has an exemplary record of producing quality, thought-provoking and targeted documents that are invaluable to legislators and this Bill is no exception. The commission published a consultation paper on this subject just over a year ago and, as promised, published its report on reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law last July. The commission&rsquo;s consultation paper comprised a comprehensive review of all legislation in the area of land law and conveyancing, highlighting those statutes which should be repealed and suggesting how they might be replaced.</P>
    <P>The programme of reform had three stated aims according to the Minister, namely, to simplify the law in this verbose area and to make it more easily understandable for both legal practitioners and the general public, to update the law in this area in the light of changes in social, demographic and economic needs and to make conveyancing easier and faster, thereby reducing the sometimes enormous costs that are associated with this legal service.</P>
    <P>This last point is something that will strike a chord with many people, particularly young people who are trying to buy their first home or to move house. They are all too well acquainted with the many substantial costs associated with such a move, not least of which are solicitors&rsquo; fees. Professional fees are measured on the recommended scale of 1% of the total price plus &euro;100. The main outlays are stamp duty, Land Registry fees and fees for searches, but there is also normally a charge for miscellaneous outlays such as telephone, postage and photocopying.</P>
    <P>Last year a conference was held at University College Dublin which examined the proposals put forward by the Law Reform Commission. This conference, entitled Modernising Irish Land Law and Conveyancing, also examined other areas of reform in Irish conveyancing practice, including the ongoing modernisation of the Land Registry and preparation for e-conveyancing. This Bill, therefore, is not so much ordinary legislation as a reforming statute that is the result of a <Col N="1865"/>long consultation process in which the considered input of many legal practitioners, academics and experts in this field were weighed.</P>
    <P>Land is something to which there is great attachment in the Irish psyche. Following the Famine, the campaign for agrarian law reform became the focal point in Irish politics. The intensive campaigning of the Land League led to the passing of the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, which established the Land Commission and granted tenant farmers the three Fs &mdash; fair rent, freedom of sale and fixity of tenure. Subsequent Acts established land purchase schemes, whereby tenants could obtain long-term loans at reduced interest to purchase the freehold title to their land.</P>
    <P>From the time of the evictions in the 18th and 19th centuries, when small Irish farmers tried to feed their families from indescribably small plots of grossly over-farmed land, through the Famine, to modern Ireland, where property seems impossibly expensive and is so far out of reach for so many people and so many young families, the Irish have retained a love of the land and a desire to own a small part of it. Today, Ireland has the highest rate of domestic owner-occupation in the European Union. It is right and proper, therefore, that we should take a strong interest in reform of this law and that we should make what efforts we can to make it as accessible and as legible as possible for ordinary, lay people.</P>
    <P>To that end, I am sorry that not all the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report have been incorporated into the legislation. I hope the Minister sees this Bill as the first of many steps along the road. I understand there are to be other Bills arising from that report and that the Minister made a commitment in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on Second Stage of this Bill, that he would bring such Bills before the Oireachtas as are necessary to complete the reform process.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provisions in this Bill for e-conveyancing. As I said, the conveyancing process appears to be unduly costly. It is undoubtedly protracted and the evidence suggests it takes a great deal longer than it should or than it does in other countries in Europe. The one or two month process of buying a house in Ireland should and could be greatly reduced and I welcome any measures that bring new efficiencies to this process to bring it in line with our counterparts, particularly in this day and age of technology and instant monetary transfers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is a throwback to the system established here under English law, an archaic and outdated structure based on feudal presumptions and tilted in favour of particular sections of society. Certainly, there is an imperative need to update such a system and to modernise it for the 21st century. Effective and efficient property registration systems and structures are essential requirements of a market economy. They are particularly important. Never in our history have we seen such a volume of land sales and expan<Col N="1866"/>sion in all types of businesses, particularly the service sector. Capital for house and land purchases will always depend on a clear and good title being available as security for financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Considering the massive increase in transactions in recent years, the Land Registry has been doing an excellent job, despite the fact the legislation it uses is totally out of sync with the capabilities of new technology. A World Bank report this year emphasised that doing business in the future will depend on every country having a quick and effective registration system. While Ireland was ranked 15th out of 145 countries surveyed, England was ranked seventh and is doing considerably better, despite the impressive information and communications technology advances made by the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry in recent years.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>It is easy to understand why the Land Registry received an award for its electronic services at the National Showcase and Public Service Excellence Awards. The annual report of the registry states that, despite a record intake of work, registry staff succeeded in boosting output to an unprecedented 206,000 cases, resulting in more than 333,000 registrations, thereby meeting current customer demand and reducing the backlog of cases. Unusually for a State body, the chief executive reported the document imaging project was completed on schedule and within budget. This project also contained elements relating to disaster recovery and business continuity, which are fundamental planks in the overall strategy and security of the system.</P>
    <P>An indication of the success of the Land Registry access service is that almost 3,500 on-line business transactions are conducted daily and at least 80% of its customer base is using on-line facilities. Of the 769,000 electronic transactions availed of by customers, 86% were conducted instantly. This is in marked contrast to the old system under which service providers, county councils, health boards, solicitors, accountants and many businesses had to employ people on a permanent basis to visit the Land Registry offices daily where they manually struggled through the records with the assistance of staff. These new efficiencies have achieved a significant saving to the Exchequer. However, it is not clear whether these savings are being passed on to the consumer. Solicitors&rsquo; offices are still the cornerstone of the registration of property and many are steeped in old fashioned traditions. They are aloof institutions which frustrate the will of ordinary citizens and small businesses. Such aloofness and tradition is used to confuse and justify unrealistic delays in solicitors&rsquo; offices.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in the Seanad to the World Bank demanding an effective registration system to facilitate doing business effectively and efficiently. The progress of the Land Registry in recent years has been impressive but, for many <Col N="1867"/>individuals and small businesses, solicitors continue to slow the system through their outdated practices and unless the Minister deals with this logjam, improvements made by the registry and legislative changes will make little difference.</P>
    <P>Solicitors should realise their very survival may depend on whether they modernise and become more responsible and accessible to a more demanding public. Many firms depend on conveyancing as a large element of their business. As the Land Registry becomes more effective in marketing its services on-line, legislation is amended to simplify transactions and more understandable, and consumers become more familiar with on-line transactions, there will not be as much demand for solicitors unless they modernise, change their attitude and realise that if they cannot provide a speedy and efficient service more professionally, consumers will work around them. If they continue as they are, the logjam in the registration system will remain at least in the short term.</P>
    <P>I have come across instances where solicitors blamed the Land Registry for delays in registration, even though they were responsible. Members&rsquo; facility to question the status of a transaction has exposed this problem on occasion. However, I refer to the major problem I have with this legislation. It provides that the Minister will not be accountable to the House. If a provision is not made in this regard, when we table parliamentary questions following the enactment of the legislation, we will receive a standard reply from the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office stating the Minister has no responsibility for these matters. Parliamentary questions tabled to the Minister for Health and Children have been ruled out more frequently since the foundation of the Health Service Executive. At least under the old system the Minister forwarded the question to the chief executive of the relevant health board who would reply to the Member directly.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry has made tremendous progress in computerisation in the past two years. The office will continue to make progress and, with the aid of legislative changes, it will become more efficient. I question the need in these circumstances to set up the property registration authority, a separate organisation that has no democratic accountability. The Minister correctly refused to set up a police authority, maintaining that the Minister of the day should be democratically accountable to the D&aacute;il for policing matters, yet under this legislation he seeks to establish an independent registry of deeds even though the current body is doing an excellent job and is making major advances in providing all its services on-line. If anything, the office is well ahead of legislators and is awaiting legislation so that it can complete its task. If the Minister persists in this regard, he should incorporate into the Bill a system whereby the new registry of deeds will be obliged to answer Members&rsquo; queries in the <Col N="1868"/>same way the Minister has done so effectively in the past. However, the Bill&rsquo;s objectives are welcome, although it is surprising it has taken so long to recognise that our registration system and laws are well out of date. We in Fine Gael will do everything to facilitate the passage of the Bill and other reforming legislation the Minister may introduce in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. As Deputy Gerard Murphy stated, the legislation, while long overdue, is welcome. I commend the Law Reform Commission on its work preparing consultation documents, reports and draft legislation in this area. The commission has pointed the way forward and made it simpler for legislators to go about their business in an informed, professional fashion.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the legislation is to provide a statutory basis for the registration of titles and deeds on computers and for a digital mapping system in preparation for electronic conveyancing. The registration of deeds has been dealt with by the Registry of Deeds since 1707 while the registration of titles was under the remit of the Land Registry. These functions will transfer under a new system to the property registration authority. Deputy Murphy felt that this body would not be democratic but it is more appropriate to establish such an authority to carry out this work rather than leaving it in the hands of the Minister. The issue is how these bodies and authorities are made answerable to the Oireachtas. I agree with Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s point that if one asks the Minister a question about the operation of the authority which will now be in place, he will kick to touch and say the issue does not involve him but the authority. He will give no answer.</P>
    <P>I hope we can operate as we currently do with the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds which fall within the Minister&rsquo;s remit. It is up to us to amend the legislation in the Oireachtas to ensure that when we go down the road of appointing regulatory bodies and authorities, the relevant Minister should be able to come to the House and answer for them. It is not good for democracy if, when we table questions, as we do on a regular basis, whether involving the Health Service Executive or any other authority, the Minister then claims to no longer have any responsibility in the area since the passing of the relevant legislation. If we are lucky, a question will be referred to the authority in question, but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not even do this. If I table a question which involves the Prison Service, or the Courts Service, the Minister refuses to answer, says it is not his business and tells me to contact the prison or courts service directly. He will not even refer my question to the Prison Service or the Courts Service. The Minister is deliberately reneging on his responsibilities. If I table for his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, a <Col N="1869"/>question which involves the Health Service Executive, she will courteously and cordially say that the matter is no longer her area of responsibility and that she will transfer my question to the Health Service Executive for a direct reply to me.</P>
    <P>Different Departments operate differently. I welcome this legislation but call on the Minister to ensure that if we are setting up another authority, as we are doing under this legislation, it contains its democratic element in terms of responsibility through the Minister to this House. The Minister of State might talk to the Minister and see what mechanism can be put in place to ensure this.</P>
    <P>The legislation is timely, although we would like to have had it before us earlier. I have been looking at the Estimates for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds, which were published last week. It seems that whoever compiled the Estimates did not know anything about this legislation or did not expect it to be passed in the year 2006, and certainly not this year. There is no increase at all in salaries, wages and allowances for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds. It is clear, therefore, that no extra staff will be recruited. All the solicitors and barristers on the authority being established, the property registration authority, will get nothing from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because there is nothing in the kitty for them, nothing in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might indicate how this legislation will, if passed, be progressed, since there is no funding in place to progress it. There is not much sense in passing legislation, putting it on the shelf and then giving no funding to progress it. This will be expensive legislation. How will we compulsorily register all the land in the country currently not compulsorily registered unless there are employees and staff of the property registration authority registering it in every county? We can talk forever about e-conveyancing but if the land is not registered there is nothing with which to do e-conveyancing. That is the starting point. How can we get the land registered if we do not make provision for any extra staff? The authority will exist as a quango but will not exist in terms of doing the work. Unfortunately, this is reflective of much of the work of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He is strong on rhetoric but weak on action when it comes to delivering.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He tends to be like that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>He does, and this legislation reflects that ministerial strength, but the strength of rhetoric rather than of delivery. However, I am not telling the full story regarding the Estimates for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds because in the final item, under the heading of consultancy services, which &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; delivered &euro;118,000 this year, an increase of &euro;3,000, there is a new heading: &ldquo;<i>information <Col N="1870"/>society, electronic government, Land Registry external access service project</i>&rdquo;. What is that? Is it the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill in electronic fashion? Presumably it is. That is the nearest interpretation we can put on it. However, there is no allocation of funds. There is a heading but there is no beef. Details are given at the bottom of the page, under the funding line: &ldquo;A. From 2006, the ongoing costs associated with the Land Registry external access service project will be accommodated within the general administration sub-heads&rdquo;. In other words, whatever is above the line will cover the work this legislation will create. There is nothing new and no extra funds. As I said, there is not a single percentage increase for extra staff in the salaries, wages and allowances. There is a 68% increase for incidental expenses and for travel and subsistence. Office machinery gets a 19% increase but there is nothing for the work which will follow from this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the amendment, section 57 of the legislation, provision is made for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to have all the powers which previously rested with the Land Commission. Right now we are dealing with the registration of property, its title and deeds. Is the Department of Agriculture and Food the appropriate Department to have that property in its ambit? If the Land Commission is now transferred in terms of its operation to the Department of Agriculture and Food, would it not be proper to have all property, in terms of the Land Registry, Registry of Deeds, which is now part and parcel of the new property registration authority, transferred to it? This has to do with land, farms, houses and property in general. Would the Department of Agriculture and Food be the appropriate Department?</P>
    <P>It is a little difficult to see how some areas attach to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Child care is an obvious example because nobody can see where the justice element is involved, and it is not. It is just a historical anomaly that child care is attached to that Department for funding purposes, but in reality it is not the pertinent Department.</P>
    <P>It might be more appropriate to have the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds in the first instance under the Department of &ldquo;Agriculture and Land&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agriculture and Property&rdquo; or something of that nature. The Minister might look at that issue.</P>
    <P>In terms of what we are trying to do today, the report of the Law Reform Commission puts it quite well in its introduction:</P>
    <P LI="1">The following principles were adopted in carrying out the project: first, updating the law so as to make it accord with changes in society; second, promoting simplification of the law and its language so as to render it more easily understood and accessible; third, promoting simplification of the conveyancing process, in particular the procedures involved, including the taking of security over land; fourth, facilit<Col N="1871"/>ating extension of the registration of title system with a view to promoting a system of title by registration; and fifth, keeping in mind the overall aims of the e-conveyancing project and facilitating introduction of an e-conveyancing system as soon as possible.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That informed this tome as well as the consultation document that preceded it. It is a fine piece of work and full compliments must go to Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, president of the Law Reform Commission, and all the staff who do Trojan work in the area of law reform.</P>
    <P>The first question is why it took so long and why we have not done something about this issue already. When I was a member of Seanad five or six years ago, I recall dealing with the e-commerce legislation which was taken by the then Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke. The same arguments were used at the time as are being used today such as society was modernising, Ireland was lagging behind, and it was time Ireland put its commence in a mechanism with modern technology that would make it accessible in a broader scope on the domestic scene and internationally. That is even truer in terms of the conveyancing of land, registration of title and deeds, ease of access and cost.</P>
    <P>Any of us who has bought a house, not to mention buying a farm, which is even more complicated, will be aware of the tortuous nature of acquiring title and the deeds to the house and the length of time it takes. The average time solicitors take to do this is 38 to 40 days with searches and so on. The consequent cost is often exaggerated because of the amount of searching required. Even if it is just the transfer of a title that has already been searched for, the same tortuous process must be gone through again. It is an overlapping process and it is redundant in terms of what needs to be done. We need a mechanism for certification that can be relied upon but every time there is a fresh transaction there is no need for every solicitor to search for titles with the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds. It is an issue we should have dealt with long ago.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about e-commerce, e-government, e-conveyancing and even e-mail. Yesterday we discussed the fact that within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, not a single garda has an e-mail address, the basic form of e-governance. Nowadays one cannot contact one&rsquo;s local garda through e-mail. He or she cannot give one an e-mail address or a telephone number, unless he gives his own mobile phone number, because there is no proper system of telecommunications in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are very much behind in this kind of area and the Estimates do not indicate an urgency in ensuring, once the legislation is put in place, that registration will take place effectively.</P>
    <P>Good title to land and property is important in terms of ownership. Ease of access to getting that <Col N="1872"/>title and checking it is important for conducting business and in terms of cost. It is important for a country such as Ireland, which is a busy market economy, to be able to do the transaction in an accurate and speedy manner and to avoid, as far as possible, the legal fees, the various stamp duties and searches, all of which can be expensive.</P>
    <P>I understand the time it takes to register a property here is 38 days &mdash; at least that is what is was last year &mdash; 21 days in the United Kingdom, 14 days in Finland and only five days in the Netherlands. That is a huge discrepancy in terms of efficiency and, no doubt, in costs. Obviously, the system in the Netherlands has been streamlined in such a way that it is easy to verify title and to have it transferred and registered. We are lagging behind in technology in terms of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The enactments to be repealed are contained in the Schedule to the Bill. They are an interesting combination of historical and social reflection from the Registration of Deeds Act (Ireland) 1707 which is being repealed. It is amazing that we are operating under an Act which is almost 300 years old in terms of the registration of deeds. How outdated that is.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutes go back to the Statute of Westminster 1285. Given that there are 150 pre-1922 statutes, it is great that we are at last getting around to repealing many of them. The codification of law and the repeal of pre-1922 statutes should be part and parcel of ongoing Government activity. This Bill has the effect of dealing with many of those statues. When one considers what has been covered in military and social history from the Flight of the Earls to the confiscation of the land, Tudor times, the acts of settlement, the Penal laws, land Acts, the burning down of the Customs House, the burning of the Four Courts and ground rents, the difficulty in establishing deeds and titles is colossal and can certainly be a tortuous and complicated process. A few problems arise as a result of this. Who will <Col N="1873"/>carry out the work of registration? Who will supervise it? Who will ensure there are no errors in the registration?</P>
    <P>I understand when the genealogical records were being transcribed for computerisation purposes that it was an absolute disaster. Those who were employed were not <i>au fait</i> with the archaic and the arcane language one gets in genealogy. The texts were obviously complicated. Errors were manifest and manifold. We are talking about the most arcane and archaic language one is ever likely to come across. While the authority is established to carry out and supervise the work, how will it take place? From where will the skilled staff come to carry out this work? How are we to ensure mistakes similar to those made in the transposing of genealogical records for computerisation purposes will not be made? Who will check mistakes do not take place? It is a serious matter. Obviously, the paper trail will remain. However, once the register is computerised, who will go through the searches to double check? How will we ensure such errors in the most complicated deeds, documents and titles can be avoided?</P>
    <P>In some cases there are no deeds or title. Dublin City Council has built on acres of land for which it has no title. As it cannot find deeds or title, it creates the title but it only creates it when a tenant decides to buy his or her home. Local authorities are sitting on portions of land. Many other portions have no title. The Minister knows all about the burning of the Four Courts and the Custom House as his family was involved.</P>

    <P>What will we do with limbo cases where there is no title? How will they be computerised? What about cases where there have been verbal agreements? A lot of property is held in that fashion, for example, where it is passed from father to son. <Col N="1874"/>Written title and deeds are not easily available in such cases.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem with this Bill is that it provides for compulsory registration of title. Only three counties have done this so far. While it was unfortunate it did not happen earlier, fair play to the Minister for making an order last September in respect of counties Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. He probably found there was no title to a plot of land in Rooskey.</P>

	<P>He included the other counties to make it look good.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Through whatever perspicacity, the Minister determined no action had been taken for decades in the registration of land and that only counties Carlow, Laois and Meath had been registered. He decided to give us another three, Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. This relates to compulsory registration. Apart from those counties, none of the remaining 20 has provided for registration, with the exception of occasional registration. A huge backlog of work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>What is the situation regarding &mdash; I say it with Deputy Morgan present &mdash; the 32 counties? Six other counties are part of the whole country.</P>

	<P>Se&aacute;n Garland.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>How will this appear in our computerised system? Has Northern Ireland engaged in this process ahead of us? Do those people with land on both sides of the Border have a computerised register of title for the land in the North but not for that in the South? These anomalies need to be reviewed. The major issue is to have all the land registered. The system cannot be computerised until it is registered. Before the Minister arrived, I pointed out that the Estimates for 2006 did not provide funding to deal with this new legislation, or to employ additional staff or services. It is hard to imagine anything happening next year without a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Why should church lands be exempt? I do not see why the church should be treated differently. While it could be argued that the Law Reform Commission recommended this course of action, the Minister has been known to step out of line with recommendations made to him. Why should <Col N="1875"/>we not have the same system for all land? Why should we allow one section to be non-compliant with compulsory registration? Do I see the Minister shaking his head indicating this has been changed? We might see an amendment to this effect.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary. I will not say it is timely &mdash; we should have had it before now. Much work remains to be done before we reach the computer age in having the title and deeds registered in a fashion that will allow them to be computerised. We will also need a paper trail. We know the problem we have experienced with electronic voting and intoxalysers not having a paper trail. The documents will need to be carefully stored, indexed and accessible. I understand little work on the indexation of land records has been done. In the past 60 years not a single parcel of land has been indexed. We have had no indexation of any of the land and property that has changed hands in the past 60 years. That paper trail needs to be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the repeal of all the redundant, archaic statutes, mainly pre-1922 and some which were enacted since. I urge the Minister to provide funding in order that we can carry out the necessary work referred to in the legislation leading to a computerised system of deeds and title for all the lands in the country.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004, of which modernisation and efficiency are key parts. Land is very important in the psyche of the people. Our history is strongly connected with the land and steeped in it. This goes back to the time of the Land League and the rights of tenants. Some amazing historical figures such as Michael Davitt pursued that agenda. It is important to modernise the legislation because of our background and history. We should broaden the debate on these issues.</P>
    <P>The matter is also relevant to what is happening in County Mayo and the Rossport five. I use this opportunity to commend them for representing the rights of small farmers and local tenants, as well as for their bravery and integrity in taking on the big international companies. It is important that we include this in the debate.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this legislation, the rights of people and the issues of land and private property, it is essential that property never becomes more important than the people. Recent cases have given rise to hot and heavy debate, particularly in the Nally case, in this regard. People have the right to defend themselves and their property but they do not have a right to kill some<Col N="1876"/>body on their property. I was amazed, shocked and horrified and I find it a disgrace that some weak-kneed politicians used this issue in their own personal and political interests.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the rights of Travellers and challenge people in this House who have not shown leadership on this issue. I refer here to Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, and Deputy Kehoe who said at a meeting in Bunclody last Thursday that he would have done exactly the same. Their comments were disgraceful and out of order. Property should never be more important than people and I challenge them on that. I raise this matter because it is important for all Deputies to show leadership on these issues. The Nally case was sad but the reality is that the person involved crossed the line. We must all accept that. Those of us who have been personally attacked over the years for defending the rights of Travellers know this. Many of us have often been in abusive and dangerous situations but we did not cross the line. It is important to highlight that fact. I commend Michael Collins and Pavee Point for showing leadership on this issue and for defending their interests.</P>
    <P>Criminality is everywhere; it is in the Traveller community and in the settled community. Some 95% of complaints in my constituency about anti-social behaviour and crime relate to the settled community but we do not see that on RTE or in <i>The Irish Times</i> or <i>Irish Independent. </i> Let us face facts. We cannot condone or support criminality but neither should we label or brand a certain community for what is going on in society. I raise this matter because it is directly connected with the issue of land and property.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as ... the Property Registration Authority . . . with the functions conferred on it by the Act. Its principal functions will be to control and manage the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds and to promote and extend the registration of ownership of land. Part 2 of the Bill contains provisions relating to the establishment and operation of the Authority and to staffing and related matters.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It further states:</P>
    <P LI="1">There are two separate systems of registration in relation to land in this country. The registration of deeds system, which is operated by the Registry of Deeds, provides for the registration of documents relating to land with a view to determine priorities between documents dealing with the same piece of land. There is no statutory requirement to register a document but failure to do so may result in a loss of priority. The effect of registration is generally to achieve priority over documents that have not been registered or have been regis<Col N="1877"/>tered later. However, registering a document does not in itself guarantee the title to land dealt with by that document.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The registration of title system &mdash; which is operated by the Land Registry &mdash; was introduced in this country in 1865 and was extended in 1891. [As we can see, the legislation is outdated.] It is now governed by the Registration of Title Act 1964. Unlike the Registry of Deeds, the Land Registry registers actual ownership of land.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It is important that we highlight this matter. Land ownership is an issue that has emerged in my constituency in the past two years. I refer to the crisis with regard to the property of those in Marino, Fairview and Santry where land has been confiscated to construct the Dublin Port tunnel. A total of 214 homes in my constituency were damaged as a result of the tunnelling and more than &euro;1.5 million has been paid out in secret deals to residents as compensation, with nobody saying anything about it. There are major cracks and flooding issues with regard to the tunnel and people have contacted my office to inform me of these matters.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the flooding of the Tolka as a result of 5 million litres of waste water being pumped into our beautiful river. This is a disgrace and I challenge the Minister for Transport and Minister of State on these issues. With regard to finance, the Dublin Port tunnel is &euro;200 million over budget and people expect that it will now cost in the region of &euro;1 billion. I raise these issues because they are directly connected to the debate about land.</P>
    <P>Another important land issue in my constituency is Dublin Bay. The proposed infill of 52 acres should be highlighted. I will continue the tradition of Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus in this House and oppose the 52 acre infill. There is much empty space in Dublin Port and we will not accept this. From the point of view of flooding, if these 52 acres are filled with concrete and more development, it will affect tides and we will have further flooding in Clontarf and Marino. The people of these areas will not accept this and I will defend their interests in the House, even if the other three Deputies who represent the constituency remain silent on the issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to land, I am in favour of sensible planning and development, particularly around Dublin Port. I challenge Peter Bacon&rsquo;s recent report in which he discusses the development of the port. In economic terms, Dublin&rsquo;s productivity in handling containers is only 32% that of benchmarked EU container ports. Traffic congestion is a much greater constraint on Dublin&rsquo;s growth than port capacity. Surely, the way forward is increased port productivity and the diversion of port traffic from Dublin to satellite ports in the region. Let us have more regional development and end the congestion. Filling in 52 acres of Dublin Bay is not the solution. It also brings <Col N="1878"/>the added nightmare of flooding in Clontarf and Fairview. We need to preserve our bay and develop our ports and we need to give everybody a share of the cake. This makes economic and environmental sense.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum also states:</P>
    <P LI="1"><i>Section 60</i> responds to a 1998 recommendation of the Law Reform Commission by inserting three new subsections in section 123 of the 1964 Act. They are necessary because section 123 does not appear to apply to the granting of appurtenant rights such as an easement . . . The absence of these words of limitation would probably mean that the easement or <i>profit</i> would last for the lifetime of the grantee only.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I commend the Law Reform Commission, which pumps out reports and excellent proposals many times a year, on the excellent work and research it carries out.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial implications, the memorandum states: &ldquo;The proposals set out in this Bill are intended to streamline and modernise the operation of the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry, in particular by preparing the way for introduction of and electronic conveyancing system.&rdquo; This is a key element of the legislation which tries to streamline and update the legislation in a common sense fashion. I welcome this important debate and the sensible proposals in the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which is a much needed step forward in addressing the needs of 21st century land conveyancing. I regret the introduction in the Bill of one of the most difficult words, &ldquo;e-conveyancing&rdquo;, I have seen in the English language. It is awkward rather than difficult. I would prefer if we had done without it as it does not flow that well from the tongue.</P>
    <P>We should be going further with this legislation. The Minister suggested that we be radical or redundant and, in that vein, I believe we should have mandatory registration of deeds within a particular timeframe and should include a sunset clause. In other words, I believe that every parcel of land in the State should be registered within, perhaps, a ten-year period. If it is not registered in that time, it should revert to the State.</P>
    <P>Developers and others experience practical problems on a daily basis in trying to establish title in both inner city and rural areas. In the inner city, many developments are held up by the sheer difficulty of establishing very complex title. It can often take years to tie down who owns a small parcel of land. That small obstacle can hold up significant development. We should consider the introduction of some kind of legislation to ensure that all property is registered by a certain date. This is particularly necessary at a time when we are trying to encourage brownfield development. The docklands area and parts of the inner <Col N="1879"/>city which have been in decline for some time need to be developed. We need some kind of radical action to deal with such areas, where it can be difficult to ascertain the nature of the title.</P>
    <P>This is also an issue in rural areas, particularly those which have suffered significant depopulation over the last 150 or 200 years. It can be quite difficult to trace the ownership of property if people have emigrated. This problem is found not only in agricultural areas but also in smaller towns and villages where it is not unknown for property to be derelict, under-used or vacant for many years. A great deal could be done to hasten the acquisition of such sites or to put in place some mechanism to enable them to be developed. The identification of the proper owners of lands under the Derelict Sites Acts has been a significant obstacle to the use of such lands. We are all familiar with sites in our constituencies and counties which have sat unused for many years, if not decades. Some kind of short sharp shock is needed if we are to make the best use of such assets. Local authorities, which own some such sites, do not have the best record in property acquisition or development. We need to make a radical change to the registration of title regulations if we are to make progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the introduction of electronic identification of and access to title. The Bill alludes to and provides for the significant amount of great work that is being done in this regard. In countries like Denmark, which offer their citizens a significant level of on-line access to information, it is practically possible to use to Internet to identify land holdings and to ascertain the name in which land is registered. I accept that there are privacy issues in this regard, but I do not think there would be any harm in establishing an easily accessible geographical information system that would allow any person to identify the real owner of any piece of land. Such a system would help us to deal with derelict and problematic sites which have been idle for many years. We could provide for a ten-year lead-in to the full operation of the system to allow people to resolve gently the many boundary disputes which exist. I do not suggest that such disputes can be resolved with a wave of one&rsquo;s hand, but the possibility of an information system being established would concentrate the minds of certain people. For example, it would put pressure on adjoining owners to sort out their property demarcation issues.</P>
    <P>This discussion on matters relating to the registration of deeds and title gives us an opportunity to examine the rights of property owners, an issue that has been considered in some detail by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. One of the difficulties with property rights in this country is that, to the best of my knowledge, they extend all the way to the centre of the earth. That leads to practical problems when land is being purchased and acquired to facilitate major infrastructural projects such as the Dublin Port tunnel and <Col N="1880"/>the rail interconnector. We need a practical definition of how far into the earth property rights extend. The problems I have mentioned could be resolved if it were known that such rights extend 10 m or 20 m down into the earth. Nobody would object to a demarcation of rights that would give people the right to have enough soil or earth under their houses to protect them from vibration and structural damage when tunnelling operations or other major infrastructural works take place.</P>
    <P>We should not debate this Bill without mentioning the difficulties with commercial leases. The former Deputy, Mr. Alan Shatter &mdash; I was about to say the late Mr. Shatter, but he is very much alive and well &mdash; introduced a very good Bill relating to property leases. We need to expand on that legislation by making provision for the assignment of leases and updating the provisions relating to the time limits on leases. We should introduce legislation to remove the cobwebs in this regard and to make clear to people the rights they enjoy when they purchase property leases. The intractable issue of ground rent also deserves to be highlighted as part of this debate. Legislation is needed to prevent the continuation of ground rents by another name under the existing law and to clear up the problems which have existed in this regard since this State achieved independence.</P>
    <P>We need to address the issue of the taxation of land. The Green Party has proposed a site value tax on land along the lines of similar taxes which have been implemented in other countries. The possibility of introducing such a tax, which has been discussed at great length, was alluded to in a report that was launched yesterday. It is not an easy bullet to bite but some measures need to be taken to provide for greater equity in taxation. I would welcome any move away from a tax on labour to a tax on real assets like land. I accept that the family home would be exempt from any such tax. There should be some kind of taxation on land that is zoned for development but has been lying undeveloped for many years. There should be some form of taxation on second homes. We should consider the possibility of introducing a site value tax for commercial property. Such a tax would concentrate the minds of property owners.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps there will be a clash of cymbals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s remarks about ground rent. The time when that issue should have been dealt with by successive Governments has long since passed, but it still needs to be grappled with. This country&rsquo;s system of land registration is outdated and inefficient. Although I welcome this Bill in so far as it goes, it is clear that it does not go far enough. The legislation before the House will not deliver the kind of reform and simplification that is necessary and long overdue. The Government has a duty to ensure that the State has an effective land regis<Col N="1882"/>tration system, which is needed by individuals and business.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>This Bill updates the law on registration of deeds and ownership of land and provides a statutory basis for the electronic registration of deeds and title. It will modernise the system that is in place in the Land Registry. It will also modernise the Registry of Deeds, which is archaic at present. The current system places unnecessary financial and time burdens on people buying property, including the already financially stretched first-time home buyers. One could surmise this position has been allowed to persist because of the financial benefit of the system to the legal profession. When buying a house one must go through a solicitor who will then use the services of a law searcher to carry out the various searches that need to be done on the property and the people buying and-or selling it. These include property searches in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, judgment and bankruptcy searches in the High Court and sometimes planning searches in the local authority. These can be costly and if the sale does not go through straight away, they may have to be carried out again. For example, just because a judgment was not filed against a person on 1 May does not mean the sale can through on 5 May. Obviously, it is an inefficient system and the net result is that people buying and selling property end up spending extra money on solicitors&rsquo; fees and unnecessary time on the process</P>
    <P>There is a strong case which Sinn F&eacute;in would support &mdash; I am sure the Minister would be pleased to hear Sinn F&eacute;in could support him on any issue &mdash; for compulsory registration of property and the phasing out of the registration of deeds system in favour of a simplified system of land registry. While this would involve considerable work during the transition stage, it would pay off in the long term.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has spoken of the fact that his Department was involved in a joint project with the Law Reform Commission aimed at the modernising of conveyancing law which involved the publication of a consultation paper and consultation process. He indicated he would seek Government approval for proposals for future legislation in this area towards the end of the year. The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law was published in July and included a draft land and conveyancing Bill. When does the Minister expect this legislation to be published? The sooner the better it is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Many of us would be of the view that the Minister would be much better deployed involving himself in this type of legitimate activity rather than much of the propagandising he does on issues well outside his portfolio.</P>

   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Trying to malign Irish republicans, as he does on a daily basis, in an attempt to thwart the Irish freedom struggle will not deal with this type of issue, to which the Minister should apply himself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair of the Deputy to say that.</P>

	<P>It is organic growth.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps that has been even helped by the activities of the Minister because sometimes it acts as a spur to encourage people to examine the situation on this island, to reflect and arrive at the conclusion that republicans are right after all. We need to deal with this issue once and for all, and the only people who are trying to deal with the Irish freedom struggle issue are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;republicans. Therefore, I wish the Minister happy days.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this legislation is designed to prepare the way for e-conveyancing, even though some people have a problem with that term. I look forward to the day when all this work can be done on-line cutting out the need for law searchers and, who knows, perhaps even the need for solicitors. This Bill is only a first step along that path. If the Minister would take seriously this part of his portfolio, it would be of great benefit to private individuals and businesses across this land. I look forward to the day when that will happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill. The Minister&rsquo;s colleague said he was disappointed the Minister was not able to be here and I am glad he is here now. I wish to pick up on a number of points touched on by previous speakers. As an aside, I was impressed by the rapport between the representatives of the leafy suburbs on the south side who are enthusiastic in their welcome of any possibility of acquiring, appreciating and sharing the areas outside their remit. I never cease to be amazed by the middle class attitudes in areas where everything is curtailed within the curtilage of the homes in those areas, but the representatives of those areas are in agreement with the sharing of everything else with everybody else and preferably among themselves. I would love to share with those representatives all the leafy shades, the swimming pools and the high amenity areas the rest of us do not have in our areas. I look forward to the time when there will be a joint sharing of those amenities between us mere humble country folk and our betters in those leafy or silvan settings.</P><Col N="1884"/>
    <P>Much has been made of the modernisation of the system and I agree there is a need to modernise the registration system. Modern technology makes registration relatively easy. Through the use of the GPS an aerial satellite photograph can be scaled down to a 1:500 scale on a map. It is possible to zoom in on a photograph and bring the information on it down to a map scale. I mention that point in the context of when a boundary dispute arises in respect of a property, particularly in the case of a housing estate in a development area, all hell breaks loose. A large black or red line is drawn around the outer perimeter and it is impossible to establish the exact boundary. The information is imprecise and it gives rise to all kinds of difficulties. I am sure the Minister, in his legal capacity, must have dealt with countless cases requiring him to devote long hours to figuring out where the boundary might lie. Countless cases have ended up in courts and they have been resolved, although not necessarily to the satisfaction of either party.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have transferred many of their deeds on to microfiche. The records are, to say the least, imprecise and unclear. Is there a back-up system? Deputy Costello also referred to this matter. It is a little like the electronic voting system in that often there is no paper record held, particularly in the case of local authorities. The lack of that back-up system is obvious when trying to find precise details in a case.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one or two further points with which the Minister will be familiar given his legal knowledge. He referred to the ability of people to allow their properties to be remortgaged to finance the house purchase of junior members of the household. I do not know the reason for that reference. It is an admission by Government that the price of houses has gone beyond the reach of ordinary people and that some means must be found to deal with the matter, as for example in a case where the property concerned was not registered or whatever the case may be. I fail to understand the necessity to make that reference unless it was by way of an admission of failure to provide, in a realistic way, for the housing needs of the next generation.</P>
    <P>The registration of lands held in common can give rise to difficulty. A technique that used to be employed, particularly by developers who seem to know how to handle the system, was that they would approach a number of tenants with tenancy rights in common and acquire them by one means or another and eventually they could register their property. I am not certain of the degree to which consultation takes place with those who might have such an interest. I refer to a scenario whereby all the people in this Chamber would have an interest, by way of family relationship, in a property or properties held in common in terms of tenancies or a commonage. A particular individual could acquire a property held in common by virtue of moving from one tenant to another so as to eke out an agreement. Eventually, if he <Col N="1885"/>or she isolated a sufficient number of the tenancies, he or she would be able to make a move to register the entire property. That has happened, with scant reference to the extended family members of the tenants. Perhaps the Minister would examine the matter in the context of this modernisation, which I agree should take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to lending and burdens on titles. He has had his own experience with planning permission down the country similar to what we humble citizens have to deal with every day. It is a common occurrence for some smart guy somewhere to decide to put a burden on somebody&rsquo;s property by way of section 37 of the planning Act which sterilises the property in terms of future residential use. It is totally illegal. It is up to the local authority, as the planning authority, to grant or refuse planning permission at some stage in the future, which it might have to do, and not be precluded from so doing by some smart alec who has decided to stick a burden on a property registered against the title. This obviously devalues the property but, funnily enough, if it is zoned or acquired by material contravention at a later stage, the sterilisation no longer applies. The sad thing is that this poor clown who owns a few acres of bogland or other propoerty, who might well have a need to realise some of his or her assets would have great difficulty getting planning permission if there was an objector. In such situations, as we all know, objectors do appear, very conveniently for themselves in many cases, although I fully recognise the right of a person to object for genuine reasons.</P>
    <P>Local authorities do not have any right to place such a burden on the title because they have other mechanisms to ensure the control and development of properties at any time. Some local authorities impose burdens, while others do not. Why should some people be disadvantaged by virtue of somebody having the right and power to ruin a property for future development purposes? This is unfair situation and although no money has changed hands and nobody, especially the local authority, has lent any money or offered it to the unfortunate landowner or house owner, the burden applied has the same effect as if a loan had been drawn down on the property. If a person wanted to apply for planning permission 20 or 30 years later, the local authority would have discretion and could overlook the sterilisation of the property. It can still follow that he or she could get permission if it was not registered as a burden on the title, as it is not registered in every case.</P>
    <P>Somebody with extra time on his or her hands makes a decision to register these burdens. In the event of an objection, it guarantees that, by virtue of their being such a burden on a title, a person cannot develop a site for future residential purposes, although his or her next door neighbour who might have secured similar planning permission with no registration of burden on the title &mdash; for no other reason than he or she was lucky <Col N="1886"/>&mdash; can do what he or she wishes with a site in accordance with the law. It has been said by many involved in the planning sector that there is no necessity to do this at all, that it is a matter for local authorities to grant or refuse planning permission without reference to anybody else and that they would be doing so within the law, whereas they are breaching this part of the legislation by doing what they want.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the number of unregistered properties. The Derelict Sites Act did work. It worked if there was a will but I could never understand the reason there was such a reluctance to implement it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is amazing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of several properties that were left idle for years, on which somebody from the local authority had placed derelict site notices. When I first became a member of a local authority, which was not today or yesterday, there was such a sign on a building in my local area for several years. Innocent that I was, I inquired for how long more the plaque would remain on the wall. I was told it had been in place for some years. I replied that the building was falling down, that there was a risk that part of it could fall out onto the road or that somebody could be injured or killed and that there would be a major claim against the local authority which had powers under the Derelict Sites Act. Lo and behold, the property was acquired. There was no difficulty in doing so once there was the will to do it. I do not know why there has been such a reluctance to enforce the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Property has become very expensive in this and other cities, as well as towns. It is hugely expensive, especially if there is development potential. The Derelict Sites Act could and should be used more effectively and efficiently and at a much earlier stage to acquire properties fairly that fall within its remit. I can think of a few around this city that might well fall within its terms. A previous speaker, whose ideological bent I would not necessarily support, referred to a property with zoned land that had remained derelict for 20 years and said something should be done about it. It is always beneficial for planning permissions to have a lifespan. They are supposed to be granted for a specified term. Zoning is also supposed to have a lifespan, with which I also agree.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with which we are faced is that the economy is based on property prices &mdash; wrongly and very dangerously. We have low interest rates. Obviously, people want to hold on to whatever property they have, be it buildings or plots of land. This even applies to tunnels, the only exception being the one that leaks water. People wish to hold on to property because it is a safer bet than financial institutions or other speculative ventures. While this happens, there is a dearth of property available for development purposes. I could go on for hours on this subject <Col N="1887"/>but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear I will not do so. There is merit in what my colleague proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy think there is any merit in a site value tax to which the speaker referred?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The value of property generally and the economy should not necessarily be decided in Ballybrit. Some other means should be found. It is extremely dangerous to have an economy based on property values. Higher wages, benchmarking and all such things grew from the fact that people were no longer able to buy a house. That came about in a variety of ways. I heard an opinion expressed that 100% loans were an invention of recent times. They were not. Such loans have been given during the past ten years. In many cases 100% loans were given on properties that had appreciated in value by 100% during the previous year. That is where the problem arose and it will cause much more serious problems. It is the reason major industries consider relocating to lower wage economies and the occurrence of the present problems in Irish Ferries. Many businesses are deeply concerned about the costs imposed upon them which derive directly from high property values.</P>
    <P>The economy should not be based on high property values. It is an extremely dangerous and precarious position to hold. When or if a bump or crunch comes, everybody will feel the draught quickly and the financial institutions will be the first to feel it. I hope they do not repossess left, right and centre given that they caused the problem in the first instance. That is enough ideology.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did not speak about the site value tax yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was thinking about going down to the Shannon and looking at sites there. I will see what it is like there before we have a site value tax. Much benefit could arise from such a tax but we must examine it closely. A person or a family might own a plot of land of three, four or five acres, which might be valuable. A plot of land measuring 100 sq. m. would be extremely valuable. That person should not be penalised for disposing of it. The man in the tent in Ballybrit should not be the person to capitalise from it. Unfortunately, that is what happens. Many people who disposed of property found its value dramatically appreciated as soon as it left his or her ownership. That is peculiar to this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the time to discuss many aspects of the legislation again. I would like to entertain the Minister and I am sure he would love to entertain me. I hope the property registration authority is effective. It is another quango and I am sick of them. Every time I come into this house to speak on a Bill, another quango has <Col N="1888"/>been formed. The Minister will not be able to answer questions. One almost has to get a screwdriver to get information about the Courts Service by way of parliamentary question. The degree to which accountability extends to this House is decreasing with every passing day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>More blather has arrived.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister invented it, he should know all about it. Each passing day and night that he performs as he traverses between television and radio stations, he is overly occupied and overburdened with the degree of blather in which he indulges on a daily basis. I am surprised the Minister does not have the international franchise for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also said &ldquo;it is necessary to be able to demonstrate good title to sell or transfer the land&rdquo;. Many of us are aware of instances of peculiarly registered title. In some cases members of the legal profession were involved in registering that title. It is appalling that situation should have happened, but it has. People a few generations from now will have to pick up the threads again.</P>
    <P>In defence of the legal profession, a few years ago I dealt with a case where title was unsafe, the property was never registered and 170 years had passed since a will was made. It was great fun and I am sure the Minister would have relished it. A young newly qualified solicitor tackled it, and she had the title registered and everything in order after six months. The solicitor went to Australia afterwards. I do not know if it was in disgust after going through the title search, but she did an excellent job and left the property with clear and precise title.</P>
    <P>I mentioned quangos and lack of accountability to the House and I will finish on that point. Hardly a day passes without a new quango. The Department of Health and Children is a disgrace with no accountability. This Bill introduces another quango and I am sure we will have more of them. I know the Minister personally agrees with me. We are elected to this House and accountable to the public. All the institutions created by this House should be accountable through a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why there is no Garda authority.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I considered that. I agree with it. It is not party policy. Nobody wants to be accountable and everybody rushes away from responsibility. If someone is asked to make a decision, let him or her do so, do his or her best and not run away from it. I ask the Minister not to create any more quangos and to examine the GPS system. It would create clearer maps to the benefit of everyone seeking to register property.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this legislation. I am delighted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present to listen to some of the issues raised.</P>
    <P>Before I speak on the legislation, the Minister mentioned the Garda authority. I welcome it and fair play to the Minister for his stance on it. I wish to bring to his attention as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a matter I witnessed in my constituency last Tuesday. During recent weeks non-nationals have come to one town in particular where women run shops on their own. The Minister must address this issue.</P>

	<P>I will speak to the Minister on it in greater detail at some other time. I feel strongly about it.</P>
    <P>Some people must deal with registration of title more than once or twice in their lifetime. Many people register their house or land. I inherited a family farm and one of the matters that most frustrated me was the length of time it took to go through the registration process and transfer the land from father to son. If this Bill and computerisation help to change that, then they are welcome.</P>
    <P>Many land owners are frustrated because they must wait for such a long time. We all attend constituency clinics regularly. Solicitors approach their clients who in turn approach us to speed up the process of title registration. At times, when we make a representation through a parliamentary question, it comes through rapidly and I acknowledge that. However, it is not good enough that people must involve politicians to speed up a normal procedure for which they pay large amounts to solicitors. If this Bill puts something in place to deal with that, it is welcome.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>his views on the impact of the reformed bilateral aviation agreement between Ireland and the US on Irish airlines and airports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[36200/05]</QRef><Col N="1890"/>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated in the House on many previous occasions, it is clear that an EU-US open skies agreement is inevitable and I am delighted with the successful conclusion of the negotiations in Washington last week that bring open skies even closer. I expect that all member states will find the contents of the draft agreement to be acceptable and that the only issue left to be considered before finally approving the agreement will be the outcome of US moves on revising its policy on control of US airlines by foreign airlines or investors. The final position of the US is likely to be known in the early months of 2006 and I expect this will allow EU-US open skies to come into effect in November 2006.</P>
    <P>The impact of open skies on Irish airlines and airports will be positive. For Irish airlines, open skies will give them access to every city in the US and enable them to negotiate with different airports to obtain the best commercial deals for new services. Aer Lingus, for example, has stated that it expects to double its transatlantic passenger numbers in the first few years of open skies and that it has been approached by several US airports with a view to starting new services. The additional access to the US, as well as the increased numbers of US tourists into Ireland, will greatly benefit Irish tourism, aviation and business links generally.</P>
    <P>This is the conclusion reached by a number of recent reports for the European Commission, the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, all of which support the move to open skies. Under open skies, each airport in Ireland that can physically receive transatlantic aircraft, including non-State owned airports, will be free to negotiate with Irish and US airlines for business. Another possibility the EU-US agreement will offer is that EU airlines will also be able to operate from Irish airports to the US and it will be a matter for Irish airports to draw in as many of the huge number of EU airlines as possible.</P>
    <P>I have also been aware all along, however, that open skies will present challenges for Shannon and that transitional arrangements are needed to allow the airport to meet those challenges. I have at all times made it clear that Ireland&rsquo;s support for the EU-US open skies deal is contingent on a satisfactory transitional period for Shannon. For this reason, I travelled recently to Washington to secure such a transitional arrangement for Shannon, details of which I published on 11 November. That arrangement, which is folded into the EU-US agreement, will give Shannon Airport a total of two and a half years of Shannon stop arrangements before open skies is fully introduced in Ireland in April 2008. This additional time for Shannon will enable it to plan an orderly move to open skies and to explore how it can exploit the opportunities that open skies offers.</P><Col N="1891"/>
    <P>I have sought and obtained assurances from Aer Lingus that, in the context of a level playing field between the airline and its competitors, it will maintain the current level of transatlantic traffic, approximately 400,000 passengers per year, with regular year-round scheduled services between Shannon and Boston and New York.</P>

  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>All of these transitional arrangements will allow Shannon Airport to plan the move to open skies in 2008 in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>Over and above the transition secured for Shannon, the Government&rsquo;s recently approved &euro;34 billion Transport 21 investment plan will greatly enhance the infrastructure of the Shannon region and broaden the catchment area of the airport. In addition to this, I propose to prepare an economic and tourism development plan in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that Shannon Airport sustains and grows transatlantic air services.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am pleased with the new opportunities that open skies will offer Irish airlines and airports. Open skies will mean even more prosperity for Ireland through increased services, tourism and trade links. I am convinced that the transitional arrangements secured for Shannon Airport means that, through its own proven resourcefulness, it will fully share in that prosperity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that open skies offers opportunities as well as challenges for airports and airlines in Ireland, the EU and the United States. We are most concerned about what is currently the State airline, Aer Lingus. If it is to compete for routes, it must be present from the outset or it will miss the boat. Aer Lingus hopes to capitalise on the opportunity for additional long-haul routes and is gearing up for this in terms of staffing.</P>
    <P>Everything hinges on the availability of capital to buy new planes. Aer Lingus has lost value as a result of Government inaction and indecision in recent years but it is clawing its way back. It has the opportunity to prosper if it gains access to capital in time for the open skies opportunities. Can the Minister commit to a deadline of the third quarter of next year for access to capital and for privatisation by flotation or private placement? According to Aer Lingus, this is the last date possible if it is to capitalise on the opportunities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mind answering the Deputy but the matter about which she asks her supplementary is entirely different to that covered in Question No. 1. A question on capital investment in Aer Lingus will be dealt with later. <Col N="1892"/>This question is concerned with the EU-US aviation agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>My question concerns the implications for Irish airlines and airports. Aer Lingus is an Irish airline.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be another question on investment in Aer Lingus and I suggest that we wait until it is asked. We want to move quickly to secure investment for Aer Lingus because this is important for the new fleet. Three criteria are always required when a public or private company goes to the market: that the market is in a good position, that the sector is healthy and that the company is in a good situation. My expectation is that all three criteria will be fulfilled next year.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Olivia Mitchell&rsquo;s assertion that the value of the company has decreased substantially as a result of Government inaction. If we had been obliged to privatise the company three years ago, the value would have been much less. Good work has been done by management and unions over the past few years compared to other national airlines, many of which have closed and more of which will do so. Aer Lingus is probably the most successful of the traditional national carriers in the way it has turned its business around.</P>
    <P>I am confident about the future of Aer Lingus, its staff and the potential customers in Ireland who would like to fly to destinations in the United States. A number of destinations in the United States are interested in having direct flights to Ireland with Aer Lingus. All of this is made possible through open skies. The conclusion of an EU-US open skies agreement enhances the value and attraction of Aer Lingus.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>if he will report on the implications for the ban<Col N="1893"/>ning of so-called super-trucks in view of the November 2005 European Court of Justice ruling on such bans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers to two different issues, namely, the super-truck, or super-cube, and the November 2005 European Court of Justice ruling. Although the Deputy does not quote the reference, I presume the question refers to the weight issue. There is a distinction between height and weight.</P>
    <P>EU law permits member states to have national weight and dimension limits for road vehicles provided they are not in conflict with European law. I understand the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice, to which the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers, relates to the prohibition by the Austrian authorities on the use of certain motor vehicles over 7.5 tonnes in weight on a section of motorway in the Tyrol region. I understand that this limit was lower than that the weight limit specified in the relevant EU directive on vehicle weights and dimensions.</P>
    <P>The issue I am considering relates to the possible reintroduction of a statutory maximum height for vehicles in excess of a limit of four metres which is the current threshold at or below which the free circulation of vehicles within the European Union must be permitted by member states. In the event that it is decided to reintroduce a statutory height restriction for vehicles, it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for consideration and for referral to other member states in accordance with the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister and the Minister of State for agreeing to allow me to substitute for Deputy Shortall who could not be in the House today.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has said he is giving consideration to a regulation on statutory weight and maximum height. His predecessor, Deputy McDaid, told the Labour Party, in answer to a parliamentary question three or four years ago, that the Government was drawing up proposals to regulate the maximum height of vehicles. Much research has already been done on this issue. Why have we not seen that research and why are we having this debate? Is it the case that the Minister and Minister of State have caved in to lobbying by specific interest groups to prevent such regulation being brought forward?</P>
    <P>The recent EU ruling on the Austrian, Italian border issue clearly indicates that restrictions may be justified by imperatives relating to the protection of the environment and the court stressed that point. Therefore, does the Minister of State agree that he has power, both at Irish and EU level, to bring forward necessary regulations in this regard?</P><Col N="1894"/>
    <P>Will the Minister of State inform the House how many EU countries have regulations on the height and weight of vehicles and what they are? What is the general pattern across Europe?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was reported in the media as saying that the contents of the EU ruling do not apply to us. Did the Minister, Deputy Cullen, or the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, discuss this matter with the Taoiseach before he made his remarks?</P>
    <P>What does the Minister of State believe should happen with the types of vehicles that will be permitted on the roads of our capital city? Both the Minister and I have served on Dublin City Council and I am interested in his view on the numbers of axles, weight and height allowed following the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan has asked a series of questions and I will try to answer them as best I can.</P>
    <P>On the Dublin Port tunnel and the proposal for a HGV management plan, Deputy Broughan is quite correct in that the matter rests with Dublin City Council on which both of us once served. The office of the director of traffic is working on proposals for an appropriate HGV management&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State ask the new director of traffic, and I presume there will be a new director of traffic, to bring this issue forward urgently?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is my understanding that work is ongoing on this issue. The Deputy will appreciate it is my desire and that of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to have the plan in place for the opening of the tunnel, which we hope will be in the early part of 2006.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue, as Deputy Broughan put it, of Government withdrawing regulations on HGV&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to the drawing up of regulations and that Deputy McDaid, the former Minister of State, said he would do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>My good colleague and friend, Deputy McDaid, was doing a number of things in the Department. I am not too sure if he was in the Department at the time, but a HGV order was made in 1991 which had to be revoked in July of 2000. The Deputy will appreciate that where we put in place a regulation, whether on height or weight, we want to ensure we do not find ourselves in a situation where we bring forward a regulation and revoke it at a later date, as we have done previously. I want to ensure we proceed appropriately, correctly and consider related issues, including business competitiveness, rail safety, road safety, environmental considerations and the protection of our existing, costly infrastructure.</P>

	<P>What of our European colleagues?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a list of 18 or 19 countries. The maximum height allowed in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey is four metres. Having said that, I should draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the UK which, as one would appreciate given its proximity, is one of our bigger trading partners, does not have a height restriction. These are the issues I am trying to consider.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Crowe</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>when he intends to implement a single body with ultimate responsibility for road safety.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35795/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The road safety authority will be the single body with responsibility for road safety. Work on the process of establishing the authority is well advanced in my Department.</P>
    <P>The authority&rsquo;s functions will include those undertaken by my Department relating to driver testing, driver licensing, vehicle standards, certain functions relating to the road haulage industry, the road safety functions undertaken by the National Safety Council and certain functions relating to accident research and statistics undertaken by the National Roads Authority. The authority will also have responsibility for the regulation of driving instruction, the introduction of compulsory basic training for motorcyclists and the introduction of vocational training for professional drivers in the transport industry.</P>
    <P>The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Amendments to the Bill are being drafted to give effect to the wider functions being assigned to the authority and the Bill is to be renamed the Road Safety Authority Bill 2004.</P>
    <P>A project team is in place in my Department to progress the establishment of the authority. Issues relating to staffing, the organisational structure and the financial arrangements for the new authority are being dealt with by the project team in consultation with the staff associations and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I expect that the authority will be established on a statutory footing in 2006. However, in the interim I am arranging that the necessary structures be developed with the support of the acting chief executive who has already been appointed. Pending the establishment of the authority, I propose to appoint an interim board shortly to facilitate the transitional phase of the establishment process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to 2006 but can he tell us whether the authority will be estab<Col N="1896"/>lished early in that year? We are all conscious, particularly at this time of the year, of carnage on the roads and in recent weeks there have been a high number of road deaths.</P>
    <P>In bringing all the bodies together, we must be conscious of the need to target different types of road accidents. In that context, the Minister has spoken in the past of a dedicated traffic corps. Does he see that as part of the bringing together of various road safety bodies? Will the road safety authority have any role in the proposed dedicated traffic corps?</P>
    <P>There is more traffic on the roads and people are more stressed as a result. How does the Minister see the authority functioning? How many people does he envisage will be on the board, how often will it meet and to whom will it report directly? Will it be a separate body and will Deputies be able to ask questions of the Minister relating to the authority?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked if we will see the road safety authority early in 2006 and the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The amendments are with the Parliamentary Counsel. I hope the process is completed as soon as possible and it is my intention to return to the House with all of the amendments in 2006, prior to which I will forward them to all Opposition spokespersons for their perusal but their content has been well flagged.</P>
    <P>A project team is working through some of the issues of scale and resources raised by the Deputy which will become clear when I receive the report and introduce the Bill. I also want to set up the board on an interim basis to begin working through some of the issues involved. I also wish to complete the discussions on the backlog in driving tests in the next 18 months.</P>
    <P>The Garda traffic corps is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and an integral part of the road safety strategy. I announced yesterday that the Garda Commissioner intended to increase the number in the corps by 50% in 2006, which I welcome. The corps will make a significant contribution to road safety but has no functions directly related to the Road Safety Authority. In their primary function as garda&iacute;, members of the corps come under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>At the launch of Transport 21, I said I was convinced that we needed a new <Col N="1897"/>approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority with the power to ensure joined-up thinking and delivery across all transport modes. In pursuit of this objective I have appointed a team chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed authority. When considering the remit of the authority, I have asked the team to have regard to the importance of timely and effective implementation of the Transport 21 investment programme in the greater Dublin area, delivering an integrated transport system and ensuring effective inter-agency co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>In modernising the regulatory framework governing public transport there is also a need to ensure proposals in that regard are coherent with the institutional arrangements being made for the implementation of Transport 21, particularly in the greater Dublin area. I will review how best to proceed with public transport reform and the proposal for a public transport commission after Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s team has reported and the Government has made decisions on the proposed transport authority for the greater Dublin area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am thoroughly confused. I received a reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question a couple of months ago to the effect that he had moved away from the idea of a Dublin transportation authority. He mentioned a transport commission and then announced a Dublin transportation authority. I wonder what is in and what is out. Will the remit of the Dublin transportation authority merely be to deliver Transport 21, the driving force behind infrastructural projects? Who will organise the competitive tendering process for the liberalisation of the bus market and provide public service contracts? Every time there is a problem a new body seems to be set up. We now have the promised transport commission, the Dublin transportation authority, the RPA procuring rail services, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Quality Bus Network Office, apart from local authorities and everybody else who organises the delivery of transport services. Is there any chance of rationalisation? What plans are in place to liberalise the bus market and when?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>I am answering the Deputy&rsquo;s first question about a question I answered some time ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is proposing two things.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is consistent with what I am now saying. The Deputy is correct to say there is a range of bodies involved in all aspects of the delivery of transport services in Dublin. Everybody was agreed it was time to rationalise that state of affairs. That is why I invited somebody with the skills and international standing of Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony to look into it. She has discussed many of the issues with me and did not want to be restricted in any way. Accordingly, I gave her a blank sheet of paper and asked her and her three-person establishment team to adopt a holistic approach to all the issues involved and report back to me. I was open to this because she had good ideas and a deep knowledge of all the issues involved. I do not want to pre-empt what the establishment team will come back to me with on the future delivery of all aspects of public transport services in Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am as confused now as I was before the Minister started to speak. Who will be in charge of liberalising the bus market in Dublin? The Minister and his predecessors have promised this for at least nine years, during which time negotiations with Dublin Bus have been ongoing. When will he stop negotiating and take action? It will be years before Transport 21 will deliver its major infrastructural projects but buses can be delivered quickly, at minimum cost and with minimum disruption. They are not a total but an interim solution. A decision must be made. Is the new body headed up by Professor O&rsquo;Mahony to deliver infrastructure or will she be, in effect, the regulator for Dublin Bus?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All of the issues about which the Deputy has asked me and more are being looked at by Professor O&rsquo;Mahony and her team to see if all the bodies involved can be amalgamated into one. This may or may not be possible but Professor O&rsquo;Mahony rightly asked not to be circumscribed in what she could look at. There are many inter-connecting issues in trying to deliver an integrated public transport system. I will not pre-empt the outcome of Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s report but all of the issues raised by the Deputy and more are part of the pofessor&rsquo;s remit and she will report back to me in a short time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>If he does not know what the body will do, can the Minister, at least, say if he is committed to a competitive tendering process <Col N="1899"/>for the acquisition of buses in Dublin? If so, when?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am committed to opening the market in Dublin and have made this clear to all stakeholders. In fairness to them, they all accept that the time has come for the market to be opened. To give further weight to that statement, over &euro;529 million will be provided for the acquisition of additional buses in Dublin alone, with some &euro;250 million being provided for the rest of the country. A significant capital amount will also be allocated under Transport 21 for the same purpose.</P>

     <asker>Ms Shortall</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>the way in which he proposes to open up the rail freight market to competition; his policy in relation to the subsidisation of rail freight operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[36251/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The rail freight market is to be opened to competition from 1 January 2006, in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 for domestic freight operations. Liberalisation is in accordance with the terms of Directive 2004/51/EC on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways. Significant progress has been made on the transposition of this directive and I will be finalising the matter in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>My Department has already transposed a number of EU directives as preliminary steps for the liberalisation of the rail freight market. These include mechanisms for the licensing of rail operators and the allocation and charging for track access. While no formal applications have yet been received for a railway undertaking licence or track access, my Department has received a communication from an operator stating its intention to establish itself as a freight operator in Ireland. I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>In respect of the subsidisation of rail freight, my policy priority remains that additional Exchequer funding should be focused on the expansion of passenger services. For example, a significant additional subvention will be required to expand bus services in Dublin and provincial cities under Transport 21. Expanding public transport passenger services to address increasing travel times and relieving road congestion provides better value for Exchequer funds. However, I am open to considering proposals for interested parties on any innovative or new approaches to rail freight which offers value for money, where a real and tangible return on Exchequer investment can be demonstrated and which compares favourably with investment in passenger services.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a fact that the 2003 strategic rail review set out four policy options for the <Col N="1900"/>development of rail freight? Is it also the case that throughout the time the Minister has been in the Department he steadfastly refused to set out which of the policy options he favours? Is it also a fact that less than 2.5% of the country&rsquo;s freight is transported by rail, even though rail freight is four times cheaper in its overall impact on the economy than other modes of transport? The Minister has been lethargic in this area. He said that he wants to put resources into passenger rail transport but he has no plans for freight.</P>
    <P>Is there a percentage target for rail freight transport in the future because it is time to take a proactive approach in this regard? The Minister said there is one expression of interest in this area. Given that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is the operator of the network &mdash; this refers to my Fine Gael colleague&rsquo;s comments on Dublin &mdash; how does the Minister see this operating? Is he considering the establishment of a transport regulator? Is this what Professor O&rsquo;Mahony suggested? Is there a conflict of interest between the incumbent operator and any new operators?</P>
    <P>How will charges for rail freight and the pricing framework be worked out under SI 643 on liberalisation? Will we end up in the same boat as bus licensing? The Minister said there has been an expression of interest in this issue. How can he avoid the danger of an operator getting a profitable piece of network or a slot in a busy network, selling his or her interest and making a pot of money and the operation ceases? The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who represents the north side of Dublin will be aware of a major bus company which got valuable road space, disappeared off the network and no longer operates a transport service.</P>
    <P>The Minister who has a grave responsibility to the House to provide a dynamic policy in this area has been incredibly lethargic. Up to now his policy has been a message in a bottle policy to the industry. He has not been proactive and he is not doing his job in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Deputy made a great speech, I am not sure what he asked me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked five difficult questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy misunderstands how rail freight operates. There is a problem in this country in this regard. In terms of freight going onto rail, it usually works over long distances carrying heavy bulk, which is not Ireland. This is part of the problem.</P>
    <P>I will give the Deputy an example. In the past 12 months, a major shipping company persuaded Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to put on extra rail journeys to carry a substantial amount of cargo to a port. In fairness to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, it decided that as it was a very innovative and excellent request it would provide the service in a cost-efficient manner. This was all said publicly by the private operator. However, the private operator had to admit <Col N="1901"/>that the project was an entire failure because the private sector companies were not interested. They could not persuade private sector companies to put their product on rail freight, even though Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provided the service at great cost. We must not say that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not been innovative in trying to provide new services.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>By EU agreement and under law, the market is being deregulated. In 2006, the international services carriages will be deregulated, and from 2007, the Irish market will be deregulated. A significant player has already indicated that it is interested in entering the Irish market, which I welcome. My role is as a regulator. I would not like to have that role in the future, whereas Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has control of the access to the hard infrastructure. This must be and is being worked out well in advance of deregulation.</P>
    <P>I would be pleased to see an increasing amount of goods off roads and being transported on rail. However, it is not as simple as it is presented and international experience confirms this.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>the improved transport links he intends to put in place in the Shannon region to improve access routes to Shannon Airport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 is primarily about connectivity. As the Deputy will be aware, there has been substantial investment in recent years in upgrading the national roads network in the Limerick, Shannon and Ennis region. Major projects completed include the Limerick southern ring road, phase 1, the N20 and N21 Adare-Limerick and N18 Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass. The N19 to Shannon has also been upgraded. These projects have greatly enhanced the access from Limerick city and its hinterland to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 will go much further and widen this access to the surrounding cities and regions by upgrading the transport links between Limerick and its neighbouring cities, towns and regions, thereby further enhancing access to Shannon Airport. In particular, the completion of the major inter-urban motorway programme under Transport 21 will provide a motorway between Limerick and Dublin, as well as linking other towns such as Nenagh, Roscrea and Portlaoise with Limerick by motorway. The development of the Atlantic corridor and the upgrading of the N24 will result in greatly improved road <Col N="1902"/>connections between Limerick, Cork, Galway, Sligo and Waterford as well as improving links between Limerick and intermediate towns such as Mallow, Tipperary and Tuam. The upgrading of other key national primary routes such as the N21 and N22, and of national secondary routes such as the N67, N68, N69 and N85, will facilitate easier accessibility to Shannon Airport from towns such as Tralee, Killarney and the coastal towns of Clare.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 provides for the phased reopening of the western rail corridor. In addition, a study on a rail link from the Limerick-Ennis line to Shannon Airport is also being carried out to assess the feasibility of linking the airport by rail to the cities of Limerick, Galway and beyond. Hourly peak and two hourly off-peak rail services will be introduced on the Limerick-Dublin route once new rail cars on order enter into service.</P>
    <P>The improved transport network under Transport 21 will facilitate easier access to Shannon Airport by providing greater connectivity between Limerick city and other cities, towns and regions. Transport 21 will widen the catchment area of Shannon Airport and provide more direct, more reliable, and quicker access directly to Shannon and Shannon Airport.</P>

   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the Minister&rsquo;s list, one would think Shannon was going to be the centre of the universe as a result of all the roads that will be built. The reality is that Shannon is facing an extremely difficult challenge in the coming year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy has just one minute, she should ask a question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Atlantic corridor, which was supposed to open up the whole western seaboard and which is essential to Shannon if it is to prosper, has no timeframe. There is no start or finish date. The western railway will go nowhere near Shannon. It is unbelievable to build a railway in the west and not connect it to the major international airport. A feasibility study is even worse than the kiss of death. It is a kiss of a long lingering death because nothing happens.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give a commitment to the west, at least in terms of transport infrastructure? Will he carry out an impact study to determine how to prioritise future investment to ensure that Shannon will survive as a major international airport serving the rest of Ireland and that the pull towards Dublin does not continue?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1903"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must give way because other Members are offering and I would like to facilitate them, if possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that Shannon faces many challenges but I do not agree that there is not sufficient focus; there is a massive focus in Transport 21 on infrastructural development for Shannon. Work is well under way on the Atlantic corridor, as the Deputy well knows, and it will be complete in its entirety within the ten-year framework of Transport 21.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>his proposals for a road safety authority; its remit, functions, powers, number of board members, staff numbers and budget; and when same will be formally established.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35976/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 71 together.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 3. Work on establishing the road safety authority is well advanced in my Department. It was originally intended that the new body would be called the driver testing and standards authority and would deliver the driver licensing and driver testing service only. The Government decided in July to assign a range of additional road safety functions to the new body, thereby creating the road safety authority. The authority will be tasked with playing a lead role in the area of road safety.</P>
    <P>The authority&rsquo;s functions will include those currently undertaken by the Department in respect of driver testing, driver licensing, vehicle standards, certain functions relating to the road haulage industry, the road safety functions currently undertaken by the National Safety Council and certain functions relating to accident research and statistics being undertaken by the National Roads Authority. The authority will also have responsibility for the regulation of driving instruction, the introduction of compulsory basic training for motorcycles and the introduction of vocational training for professional drivers in the transport industry.</P>
    <P>The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Amendments to the Bill are being drafted to give effect to the wider functions being assigned to the <Col N="1905"/>authority and it is to be renamed the road safety authority Bill 2004.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the Bill will become law by the middle of 2006, following which the authority will be established on a statutory footing. The Bill provides for a board to oversee and direct the work of the authority that will comprise a chairperson and not less than six and not more than 11 ordinary members. Pending the establishment of the authority, I propose to appoint an interim board to facilitate the transitional phase of its establishment.</P>
    <P>A project team is in place in my Department to progress the establishment of the authority. Issues relating to staffing, the organisational structure and the financial arrangements for the new authority are being dealt with by the project team in consultation with the staff associations and the Department of Finance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>From the Opposition&rsquo;s point of view, the establishment of this new authority is a pig in a poke. We do not know what it is going to do or if the new legislation will be more than enabling in nature. What powers and functions will the body possess? What value will the body add if it simply amalgamates the testing and road safety functions? All that is wrong with those bodies is they are not resourced; they could do the job of the new body if they had the resources.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that the Deputy is being asked to buy a pig in a poke. I have appeared before two committees and explained in detail what I am doing. I have here laid out, in broad but direct terms, the responsibilities of the authority. I have also stated that the National Safety Council will become part of the authority to create, on a statutory basis, one body that will have responsibility for co-ordinating all matters, some of which lie with the NRA, the driver testing authorities, local authorities and various sections of the Department. Everyone has recommended that the functions should be overseen by a single statutory road safety authority with real teeth.</P>
    <P>I have answered this question many times. When the amendments are ready, I will give them to the Deputy in good time before we deal with them. I hope that is acceptable and that the Bill will be a substantial improvement on the original proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the timeframe for the amendments? This is an unsatisfactory way to do business. Why did not the Minister not come up with a major safety authority Bill in the first instance? Why must this Government always introduce a Bill and then radically change it?</P>
    <P>In April, the Minister appointed a chief executive officer designate of what was then to be the driver testing standards authority. What is the position as regards that appointment? Has that person been paid since April? What compen<Col N="1906"/>sation implications exist due to the change of the functions of the authority and his role?</P>
    <P>The Minister promised action on a number of outstanding issues, including the practical training of motorcyclists and the regulation of driving instructors. Must we wait until the authority is established before we can take action in these areas?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing this and we are waiting because the Labour Party asked me to do it on Second Stage of the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had asked for it before then as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This came to fruition during the debate and in another forum. The momentum gathered and I said I would stand back. If there is a better way, I try to work with it if it is possible to do so. It has caused some delay but the consensus is that it was better to establish the new authority from scratch and appoint the interim chief executive officer, who is already working away on getting things in place.</P>
    <P>The amendments should be ready early in the new year and we can then start the debate early in the new session. I have set a deadline of the end of next year&rsquo;s first session for the Bill passing through both Houses and establishing the body on a statutory basis.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 172, 183, and 186 together.</P><Col N="1907"/>
    <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to a Priority Question earlier. The conclusion that open skies will be good for Irish tourism, aviation, business links and the economy generally is clear and I do not intend to delay those benefits further by commissioning another study on the impact of open skies. As already stated in reply to the earlier priority question, however, I have also been aware all along that open skies will present challenges for Shannon and that transitional arrangements are needed to allow the airport to meet those challenges. I have at all times made it clear that Ireland&rsquo;s support for the EU-US open skies deal is contingent on a satisfactory transitional period for Shannon and I have published details of that arrangement, which will give Shannon Airport a total of two and a half years of stopover arrangements before the open skies policy comes in fully for Ireland in April 2008. This additional time for Shannon will enable the airport to plan an orderly move to open skies and to explore how it can exploit the opportunities the policy offers.</P>
    <P>I have sought and obtained assurances from Aer Lingus that, in the context of a level playing field between the airline and its competitors, it will maintain the current level of transatlantic traffic &mdash; approximately 400,000 passengers a year &mdash; with regular year-round scheduled services between Shannon and Boston and New York. All these transitional arrangements will allow Shannon Airport to plan the move to open skies in 2008 in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>In addition to the transition secured for Shannon, Transport 21 will greatly enhance the infrastructure of the Shannon region and broaden the catchment area of the airport. I propose to prepare an economic and tourism development plan in consultation with the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure Shannon Airport sustains and increases transatlantic air services.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am pleased with the new opportunities that the open skies policy will offer Irish airlines and airports. It will mean even more prosperity for Ireland through increased services, tourism and trade links. I am convinced that the transitional arrangements secured for Shannon mean that, through the proven resourcefulness of those who run the airport, it will fully share in that prosperity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying he will not undertake the economic impact assessment requested by my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, and instead will prepare a regional plan for the future in conjunction with the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Enterprise, Trade and Employment? Will that take into account the necessity to compensate for the jobs and business that may be lost following the curtailment of the stopover? The Minister announced this fundamental change to air services in New York while he was negotiating Ireland&rsquo;s position in the open <Col N="1908"/>skies policy. Does he agree the fundamental problem in this regard is he allowed too short a lead-in to the change? Thirty months is too short for a major development in any region.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While Shannon Airport faces significant challenges, it will also be presented with major opportunities. The change should be embraced positively, not negatively. I instanced why management at Knock Airport, which has a smaller hinterland compared with Shannon Airport, is positive about the open skies policy and looks forward to providing many transatlantic routes. As Shannon Airport is a major international brand in America, it should grasp the opportunity rather than look backwards. An economic impact assessment would have examined a <i>fait accompli</i>. We should look forward and my plan has been well received by management, unions and politicians in the area. It will embrace the future and maximise opportunities for Shannon Airport.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the open skies deal? Will it be in place prior to April 2008? If so, is he satisfied both Shannon and Dublin airports will not be disadvantaged and miss the boat by not establishing routes and so on?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there limits to the development of air travel? If the increase in air transport continues, it is predicted that by 2020 it will account for all the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions Ireland is permitted under current EU targets. In addition, the peak in global oil production is imminent and that is likely to impinge on development. Has the Minister&rsquo;s Department set limits on the expansion of air travel?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell would make a good snooker player as she tries to position me between two opposing points of view. The negotiations were difficult because I was trying to strike a balance to benefit the entire State but, equally, I wanted to achieved a transitional arrangement for Shannon Airport. The balance has been struck and even though open skies will be in place next year, there will not be an immediate explosion. All airlines whether they are based in America or Europe, will need to build capacity to take advantage. That transitional period will facilitate domestic airlines, particularly Aer Lingus, to do the same and they will not be disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The deal agreed in the EU-US negotiations, which was concluded last week, went well and more technical arrangements were agreed than everybody expected. It remains to be seen whether we will sign off on it at our December Council meeting. A two-step approach is likely. All member states will agree the deal in December but they will allow two or three months to monitor what happens in the control <Col N="1909"/>and ownership of airlines in America. It will be ratified at the March Council meeting and will be in place next year. That is generally the indication from all member states.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15, 19, 25, 39 and 98 together.</P>
    <P>The licensing and allocation of track access for rail operations are governed by two EU directives which have been transposed into Irish law: SI 537 of 2003, the European Communities (Licensing of Railway Undertakings) Regulations 2003 which transpose into Irish law EU Directive 2001/13 establishing a mechanism whereby an operator can apply for a licence to operate as a railway undertaking; and SI 643 of 2004, the European Communities (Allocation of Railway Infrastructure Capacity and the Levying of Charges for the use of Railway Infrastructure and Safety Certification) Regulations 2004 which transpose into Irish law EU Directive 2001/14 providing for the allocation and charges for track access.</P>
    <P>These regulations establish a fair and transparent system for granting licences and allocating track capacity and set out the criteria to be considered in awarding a licence and in granting track access. These regulations are to be used where member states decide to open their market. However they do not create an obligation on member states to liberalise services by having more than one railway operator.</P>
    <P>Directive 2004/51/EC on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways creates an obligation on member states to open their rail freight markets to competition from 1 January 2006 in the case of international freight and from 1 January 2007 for domestic freight operations. Significant progress has been made on the transposition of this directive and it will be finalised in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I am the regulator and I am responsible for granting licences, while Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as the operator of the railway infrastructure, is the infrastructure manager and is responsible for the allocation of track capacity. The provisions of the directive will guide me in considering applications for licences. An intending freight operator dissatisfied with the terms and conditions offered by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for access to the rail network has a right of appeal to me as the regulator.</P>
    <P>While no formal applications have been received for a railway undertaking licence or track access, my Department has received a communication from an operator stating its intention to establish itself as a freight operator. My Department has been in touch with the operator and a formal application is expected in the new year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of a liberalised rail freight market, as the emergence of alternative fright providers has the potential to increase capacity and choice for freight users. It will also increase choice for Irish exporters moving goods by rail within the rest of the European Union.</P><Col N="1911"/>
    <P>With regard to the subsidisation of rail freight, as I said in reply to Question No. 5, my policy priority remains that additional Exchequer funding should be focused on the expansion of passenger services. However, I am open to considering proposals from interested parties on innovative or new approaches to rail freight where a tangible return on Exchequer investment can be demonstrated and which compares favourably with investment in passenger services.</P>
    <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s decision to stop proving a single unit container service was a business decision made by the company. Container freight levels had dropped to about 35 containers a day when the service ceased in July of this year. Container freight traffic is only commercially viable on a large scale. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann estimates that 18 40-foot containers are needed for a commercially viable train load. The company would welcome proposals for full train load container freight services from any quarter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief, in recognition of the fact that the Minister has dealt with part of this issue during Priority Questions. Could the Minister make a bold move in this area rather than waiting for operators to come to him with expressions of interest? Can he advertise and set out a policy framework to encourage interest, rather than inquiring about a European directive regarding compulsion or requiring operators to come to us? Can he not spell it out that the Government is trying to encourage, support and develop this area? I am interested to see if he is willing or able to take that approach rather than wait to see who comes along and makes an application.</P>
    <P>On the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he does not want to support rail freight service because he wants to concentrate on passenger services, does he agree that the connected issue about road safety is increasingly important in this area because road freight helps create accidents, so there is motivation for us to subsidise, support and develop rail freight which is a safer transport mode which also has environmental and social benefits? What will it take for the Minister to revise the policy he has of not supporting rail freight services when most other EU countries are quite willing to support them?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case. I have enunciated my priority to the Deputy but I am not going to start liberalising the market by suggesting to the market generally that there is a pot of taxpayers&rsquo; money to be shovelled out to it willy nilly. That is not the route I am taking, and I hope the Green Party will support me in that. New and innovative ideas may well come forward which may involve new ways of looking at support for rail freight and, if so, I will be happy to consider <Col N="1912"/>them. However, at this point I am not going to make the opening gambit of market liberalisation by asking the market to come to us with a promise of a great deal of taxpayers&rsquo; money. I will not approach the issue in that manner.</P>
    <P>Regarding the active participation or pursuit by my Department or me in encouraging rail operators to the Irish market by setting out a framework, we are well ahead of some countries in embracing the directives. It is known that the directives take effect in two ways from 1 January 2006, just a few weeks away, and 1 January 2007. I have made it clear that the Government welcomes any additional carriers onto the rail network. Already there are indications of at least one company being interested.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Investors look at the overall climate, so the problem is that anyone looking at this country now would see that those in power have only been interested in organising the demise of rail freight and an exit from it. In those circumstances the Green Party would support financial assistance to encourage new entrants to the market and to set a market which would attract them.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he would consider this, so how would he do so? Has he commissioned a study? Has he asked the Department to look at the options, is he looking at international examples or should the Opposition parties suggest specific means?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said earlier, perhaps when Deputy Ryan was not in the House, what the Irish rail freight market offers is clearly very limited. Rail freight is only viable over long distances. The island of Ireland, being the size it is, does not provide that type of capacity in its network.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Minister know that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike most other European countries, which are connected to each other, we are not. We are quite isolated in the context of the international rail freight market. While I encourage entrants to the Irish market, it is not rocket science to figure out why there is not a great interest in the market.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Minister know that? He does not seem to have a strategy. Is anyone looking at a situation where subsidies might be beneficial, given the overall cost benefit to the economy? How does the Minister know? He is simply shaking his head and saying it is not possible. After Christmas, the ports, which are part of the portfolio for which I have responsibility in the Labour Party, will come within the Minister&rsquo;s Department. Can the Minister come up with some innovative ways of using maritime and rail <Col N="1913"/>freight to move vast amounts of goods by public transport?</P>
    <P>The Minister said there has been one expression of interest in the Irish rail freight market. Clearly, I am strongly in favour of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as the infrastructure operator but as the regulator, how will the Minister shape the pricing structure, charging mechanisms and so on? Does he envisage a situation where there will be a regulator mechanism, perhaps arising from the comments he made earlier regarding Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s work? Is that what we are expecting? Down the line, is it possible that some of the likely disputes about limited rail space and charges will end up in the courts, as happened with telecom companies?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder if people listen to me. I have been saying all along that a major, substantial international operator is very interested in coming onto the Irish market. That is terrific news. Are we saying that one such operator is not enough, that there should be ten or 20? One substantial competitor would have a dramatic effect on the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Let us be realistic about the scale of our infrastructure in terms of rail. We have invested more than &euro;1.5 billion in recent times and will be spending more in terms of upgrading the quality, track signalling and all the safety issues. In terms of infrastructure, we have made the rail system attractive to operators by putting rolling stock onto it because they know they are getting a very good system in place. Accordingly, we already have a substantial international operator, a name which will be known to everyone internationally, interested in coming onto the Irish market. I have already told the Department that when the opportunity arises early next year, that operator will be seeking a licence. That is very good news.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that in the past it seemed that only long distance rail freight was economically viable. However, change is now occurring. Does the Minister accept that this situation will almost certainly change further for environmental reasons? Road freight will become increasingly expensive as petrol costs grow because we will probably have increasing supply instability in the future. It would thus be folly on our part to allow what is currently going on, which in effect is the disposing of capacity by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the selling off of almost new wagons, the removal of track and so on. Will the Minister agree to stop this? It may be five, ten or 20 years before it becomes economically viable but some day we will reap the folly of that if we allow this to go on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one operator came along and then left because he could not get private sector people interested. Just because one operator fails to do his marketing should not be a reason <Col N="1914"/>to write the market off for everyone. Will the Minister act as a regulator and not refer interested parties to negotiate with CIE, which has made it clear to those who approached it in the past that it does not want competition? It is up to the Minister to ensure the opportunities exist when we have full liberalisation. I am delighted to hear there is an operator interested but it is up to the Minister to ensure that we capitalise on that opportunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I can put on the record, because it is already known, that the company which came and did the deal, and publicly stated that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann did everything to facilitate it, was the Norfolk Line which runs major railways internationally. I was at the meeting, which was not organised by me, where it made its statement. The problem is that getting the unit load from the factory door to where the railhead is, getting it on, storing it, getting it off and organising its collection at the other end, involves a truck. Those costs become prohibitive. That is the difficulty. The point made by Deputies Ryan and Mitchell is an interesting one and it is correct. As we put more pressure on our environmental issues there may well be a cost benefit to operators looking back to rail. That is the reason we have made huge investment in the infrastructure. No rail infrastructure will ever be removed again, certainly as long as Fianna F&aacute;il is in Government. That is the reason we have invested to date.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is selling off new wagons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

This is an outrageous development. Will the Minister come into the House before the end of this session today, on behalf of the Government, and make a statement on the Government&rsquo;s attitude to this incredible act of high sea piracy on foot of Irish Ferries campaign to sack 540 workers and replace them with the most exploited labour from eastern Europe and taking this unprecedented action today on the high seas in Pembroke and in Holyhead?

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>his views on whether a greater than recognised number of road traffic accidents are due to road conditions; the steps he is taking to ensure that public safety is protected through proper observance of recommendations that already exist and may not be complied with or enforced, which enforcement would ensure a major reduction in road traffic accidents due to road conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35847/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest available analysis from the National Roads Authority, NRA, of the factors contributing to fatal and injury accidents, as published in Road Collision Facts &mdash; Ireland 2003, indicates that behaviour of drivers, 86%, and pedestrians, 10%, are the key contributory factors, whereas road factors were identified as contributory factors in only 2.8% of fatal and serious injury collisions. The corresponding figures for 1998 were 79% driver behaviour, 12% pedestrians, and 5% road conditions. We have almost halved the road conditions factor.</P>
    <P>However, despite the fact that the level of injuries and fatalities that can be directly attributed to road related issues is relatively small and decreasing, it is still vitally important that any risk posed by the road is minimised. In recognition of <Col N="1916"/>this the NRA funds an extensive programme of engineering works with the aim of improving road safety and dealing with accident blackspots on national roads.</P>
    <P>The NRA has an extensive high risk accident blackspot remedial programme that aims to reduce the number and severity of accidents occurring on the existing network of national roads. An average of 80 such locations are treated each year. In addition the NRA has introduced a new initiative this year, the high cost remedial measures programme, where more expensive works are required to solve the accident problems at particular locations. A total of 12 sites has been targeted this year, at a cost of almost &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>The major investment in the upgrade of the national roads network, in excess of &euro;18 billion over the lifetime of Transport 21, is also delivering a major road safety dividend. New roads, constructed to best practice standards, help to reduce road accidents and fatalities. The safe management of road improvement works is a matter for the road authorities involved and their contractors. I understand that requirements and standards in regard to pavement improvement works and resurfacing and the signage of such works are set out in the NRA specification for road works and two circular letters issued by the NRA in March and May 2002. I understand that the NRA has since consolidated and re-issued these circulars supplementing, where appropriate, the previous guidance.</P>
    <P>The timely completion of road improvement works in accordance with these requirements is a matter for the local authority concerned and, as part of its overall supervision of the national roads programme, the NRA.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accommodating me. The Minister said road factors contribute to only 2.5% of fatal injuries. I think road factors account for a much higher percentage of fatal injuries. I raised this issue on a previous occasion in the case of Aisling Gallagher who died just after St. Stephen&rsquo;s day last year. I was asked by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to submit information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Why did the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, not come back to me even though I submitted all the information on that case? Why did the NRA not take responsibility for this accident which was due to road conditions? Why is there not a centre for public safety as recommended in the 2000 report? Why does not somebody shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;? In the Kentstown accident, road conditions were to blame but it looks as if there will be a cover up in this case.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would sympathise with any family that has lost a family member under any circumstance, tragic circumstances, road accidents and so on. That goes for all of us in the House. I simply made the point in reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question that the latest figures show that road factors were responsible for only 2.8% of fatal and serious injury accidents. I went on to say that notwithstanding that relatively low figure it is vital to continue to invest in the roads programme. We are investing in quality new roads and have innovative programmes to upgrade existing roads. That is a small figure in terms of the overall proportion. I would like to see a huge improvement in driver behaviour, given that 86% of fatal and serious injuries are caused by driver behaviour. Therefore, it comes down to individual responsibility.</P>

The report spelt out that to proceed with the Corrib Gas project as laid down would be hazardous and would pose too great a danger to those who live beside the pipeline. This is a narrow peninsula. Even taking into account any safe distances, clearly it is not safe for those people to live beside this pipeline. Given that the peninsula is narrow there is no room for the pipeline so near to the people in those houses. Something has to give. As envisaged, it is clear the two elements do not fit.</P>
    <P>The independent consultant was employed to investigate the position and he did so. It is clear the pipeline rule is not safe. While the Government has said it would be safe and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has said on many occasions that it is safe to live within 70 metres of the pipeline. Even applying international standards, people living within 200 metres and 400 metres of these pipelines, but with <Col N="1919"/>much lower levels of pressure, have died, having been scorched totally. There are minimum safe distances but one cannot apply those distances to this narrow peninsula.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State whether there is any rationale in proceeding with the Corrib Gas project as envisaged. Nobody is against the gas coming in but surely people have a right to be safe in their own homes. Five people from Rossport spent 94 days in jail to protect their right to be safe at home. I am sure the Minister of State will tell me about all the investigations that took place. These quantitative risk assessments, QRAs, were based on historical precedent. However, no historical precedent exists for this pipeline. It is an exotic pipeline project that has never been done before. No QRA will assess the risk. I am sure the Minister of State will talk about the study by Advantica, commissioned by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, this will not consider the consequences of a rupture to the pipeline. If that pipeline ruptures, the local people will be dead, as they know, which is why they were prepared to go to jail.</P>
    <P>Someone wanting to build a house needs to get planning permission from the local authority and can then make an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. It can then be further appealed to the High Court on a point of law. However, this pipeline was exempted by the former Minister for Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey. No proper planning for the pipeline took place. It was rushed through on the basis of ministerial consent.</P>
    <P>The study points out that representatives of Shell met An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Shell and its partners, Statoil and Marathon, met the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Certain assurances were given regarding the planning process. Four days later the full board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la met representatives of Shell, Marathon and Statoil. The rest is history. The project was passed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la following undue access to that board.</P>
    <P>The oil and gas companies have been given latitude allowing them to hold a licence for 19 years and then walk away. I raised this matter with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and suggested he should restrict the licence to five years.</P>
    <P>How can the project be allowed to proceed when a report by a reputable independent expert from America has made it clear that it poses too great a hazard to the people who will be obliged to live beside the pipeline?</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware <Col N="1920"/>that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has appointed Mr. Peter Cassells as mediator in the Corrib gas project dispute. Mr. Cassells was general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions from 1989 to 2001 and was one of the main architects of the social partnership agreements. He is chairperson of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has closely followed the progress of the mediation process, under the leadership of Mr. Cassells, and is grateful to all concerned for their active participation in it. The Deputy will also know that the Minister has ordered a full safety review of the Corrib onshore upstream pipeline. Pending the outcome of this review Shell E&amp;P Ireland has, at his request, ceased all works on the onshore pipeline. In addition it has ceased works on the offshore pipeline to allow for a period of public discussion and dialogue. Essential environmental and geotechnical maintenance and monitoring at the Bellanaboy terminal site are continuing but all other work on the terminal site has been suspended.</P>
    <P>The current safety review is both thorough and comprehensive and is being carried out by independent internationally recognised experts. Advantica, the successful bidder, is a world leader in the development and application of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies for gas pipelines.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt Deputy Cowley. I have listened to the Deputy times out of number. Our Constitution happily protects people and gives them the right to meet to discuss any issue.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should allow the Minister of State to continue without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The study involves a critical examination of all relevant documentation relating to the design, construction and operation of the pipeline and associated facilities. Advantica has been asked to conclude whether in its opinion the proposed installations have been or will be designed, constructed, installed and operated to appropriate standards and to identify deficiencies, if any, regarding the safety aspects of the proposed Corrib gas onshore pipeline and to make recommendations as to how these can be remedied.</P><Col N="1921"/>
    <P>The Minister has been conscious that people who have views relating to the safety of the pipeline should have the opportunity to have those views considered by Advantica. Views have been invited from local residents, communities and any interested parties. Advantica has visited the Corrib site as part of its work and a two-day public hearing, chaired by John Gallagher SC, was held in Mayo last month. I understand the Minister intends to publish the draft safety review shortly. In addition to the safety review, a new strengthened project monitoring procedure has been put in place to ensure the developer complies with all legal consents issues.</P>
    <P>Extra personnel have been assigned to the petroleum affairs division of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and a new technical advisory group, independent of the petroleum affairs division, has been established to advise, monitor and verify works being carried out on this project. Authorised officers are empowered to inspect works on a regular and on-the-spot basis. These revised monitoring arrangements have been included in the terms of the most recent consent issued to the developers. The Minister also recognises the necessity to spell out more clearly the safety regime, which will be in place before the first gas flows through the pipelines from the Corrib field.</P>
    <P>It is his intention, as outlined in the House recently, that a clear regime for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline will be in place. This will be an open and transparent system which will ensure that the highest standards of safety will apply. Obviously, if Advantica makes any recommendations on these issues in its final report the Minister will take them fully into account in the preparation of the final consents.</P>
    <P>The Corrib gas field is a major infrastructural project, which has the potential to play a significant role in the economic and social regeneration of County Mayo and the north-west region. It will facilitate the improvement of the region&rsquo;s infrastructure and increase local employment, in both the short and long terms. The development will also increase Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply by providing a reliable, secure and indigenous source of gas.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the potential benefits, it is crucial that the project proceeds having regard to the views of all the interested parties. The mediation process has a vital part to play in this. Copies of the report published by the Centre for Public Inquiry have been forwarded to the consultants. The Centre for Public Inquiry will be in a position to comment on the findings made therein at a presentation to be held at the beginning of December. The mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells, will chair this presentation and the consultants from Advantica will also be present.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the resolution of issues surrounding the Corrib project has been a <Col N="1922"/>priority for the Minister. I share his hope that the mediation process under way, augmented as needed by the results of the safety review, will allow all those concerned to work together to resolve the difficulties that have arisen on this very important gas project.</P>

    <sTitle>Gender-Based Violence.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Tomorrow marks the beginning of 16 days of activism to eliminate all forms of violence against women. While to some this may seem a lofty ideal, if we do not aspire to this noble goal how can we even begin to achieve it? It begs the question how much violence is tolerable. I support wholeheartedly this campaign and I am glad to have the opportunity to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>To coincide with these 16 days a consortium of Irish human rights, humanitarian and development agencies along with Development Co-operation Ireland have produced a report on gender-based violence entitled, A Failure to Protect; a Challenge to Action. The report is recognition that gender-based violence is rooted in gender inequality and unequal power relationships. It is usually, though not exclusively, perpetrated against women and girls and is particularly prevalent in areas of armed conflict. War has exacted a particularly high price on women. Rape is a common and devastating weapon of war. As the subject of gender-based violence is shrouded in silence, impunity and complacency, the horrific violence has been permitted to flourish.</P>
    <P>Shockingly the report reveals that gender-based violence and sexual exploitation are also found in humanitarian situations, where sex is traded for food rations, for safe passage and abuse is also perpetuated by people in positions of power in the community such as teachers. In Mozambique last year I spoke to parents who refused to let their daughter attend school because of the price in sexual favours the teacher was exacting from the child to achieve grades.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The report acknowledges the onus and responsibility on humanitarian agencies and governments to provide for the protection of all citizens in conflict and post-conflict situations. It also recognises that failure to act on gender-based violence compromises women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; ability to benefit from development programmes and is a hindrance to the achievement of the millennium development goals.</P>
<P>The cost of not engaging with gender-based violence is significant. Human rights are abused, atrocities and individual trauma and suffering continue and development interventions are undermined. The statistics are truly gruesome. Some 75% of women in Liberia were raped during the conflict. In Bosnia, between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped during five months of conflict in 1992. In Thailand, 14% of gross <Col N="1923"/>domestic product comes from prostitution and sex trafficking. In Germany in 2002, some 811 women, mainly from eastern Europe, were freed from white slavery rings. Silent voices permit these injustices to continue.</P>
    <P>The report describes itself as a call to action. It demands those of us with a strong voice to use it to highlight, to provoke and to insist upon change. I salute this initiative and particularly the leadership of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on this issue. It is but a beginning, but a very important first step. How we use the information contained in the report will measure our solidarity with the most vulnerable groups in the most atrocious conditions. I trust we will not be found wanting.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>

   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is the first day of 16 days of activism to stop violence against women and I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Violence against women is a pervasive human rights abuse and is, unfortunately, an increasingly common feature of today&rsquo;s conflicts. It is used as a means of brutalising women. The violence is often extreme and can cause lasting physical and psychological damage. HIV-AIDS is a real risk for the victims. Such rapes may cause pregnancies which can result in victims being socially outcast and greatly impoverished. They may also ruin existing marital relationships or destroy the prospects of marriage.</P>
    <P>The consequences of such violence are not solely confined to the victims. The intention of those who practise this violence is not only to terrorise their victims, but to terrorise the groups and communities to which they belong. Violence against women is often part of a ruthless and barbaric strategy to ethnically cleanse certain areas and is a prime instrument in the displacement of people internally and as refugees.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, gender-based violence must be recognised by the international community. Measures must be put in place to ensure we tackle it effectively. This means preventing it, in so far as is humanly possible, and properly dealing with the aftermath for those unfortunate to be its victims.</P>
    <P>Last year, at the initiative of Amnesty International, a group of Irish development and human rights non-governmental organisations came together with the Department of Foreign Affairs to discuss how best to respond to the high levels of rape being reported in the conflict in Darfur, Sudan. All concerned recognised that the problem must be looked at in a systematic manner, rather than on a case by case or area by area basis.</P>
    <P>Officials in the Department and representatives of the agencies involved formed a consortium to identify how best to develop institutional <Col N="1924"/>capacity to respond on a systematic basis to violence against women. The consortium included personnel from the Department, Amnesty International, Concern, Christian Aid, Child Fund of Ireland, Dtalk, Goal, Tr&oacute;caire and Self Help. It commissioned research to identify current practice and this led to a report, launched by Mrs. Mary Robinson and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on 18 November. On that day, a round table meeting was held with the NGOs involved and they made commitments in their programmes to tackle violence against women. I am pleased to say that Mrs. Mary Robinson has taken on an oversight role in this regard and will review progress in 12 months&rsquo; time.</P>
    <P>The Department recognises violence against women as an extremely important human rights issue. It is an integral element of armed conflict and extremely widespread. It is systematically used as a weapon of war and is on the increase, especially in Africa. Some of the statistics are truly staggering. It is estimated that up to 75% of women in Liberia were raped during the conflict in the 1990s. In Rwanda, between 250,000 and 500,000 women were raped during the genocide, and a decade later 67% of survivors are HIV positive.</P>
    <P>Even in the context of humanitarian relief operations women are vulnerable to sexual exploitation in return for food rations, safe passage and access to essential goods and services. This reflects a profound failure by the international community to protect the fundamental rights of populations affected by conflict.</P>
    <P>The report published by the Department of Foreign Affairs in co-operation with the Irish NGOs recognises the need to listen to the voices of women, especially those who are victims of violence. Their voices need to be heard at a political level. We must co-ordinate our response, not just at political level but in the field. Programmes must be designed that aim to reduce the incidence of violence and respond to the needs of women in areas where widespread abuse has taken place. In this regard, the Government is committed to putting in place significant appropriate financial resources.</P>
    <P>This report is only the beginning of a process which I hope will, over the coming years, make a real difference to the lives of women in developing countries. I thank all involved in the preparation of this excellent report, including Mrs. Mary Robinson, for agreeing to be part of this important initiative. I am sure she will play an important leadership role in ensuring that the Initiative will be effectively implemented over the coming years.</P>

    <sTitle>Public Facilities Access.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Sports and <Col N="1925"/>Tourism must answer questions as to why the National Aquatic Centre pool at Abbotstown, which has cost the taxpayer more than &euro;60 million so far, is off-limits to people with a severe physical disability, including the children of Scoil Mochua in Clondalkin, a school that caters for severely disabled children.</P><?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
    <P>I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach and the Minister. First, is it true that doors and other access points to the pool centre are too narrow to permit access for people with severe physical disability? Second, will the Minister publish the disability access audit recently carried out which identifies the access problems of the centre? Third, how much will it cost to make the centre fully accessible and how long will it take to do the work? Fourth, whose responsibility is this work? Is it the responsibility of the Government company, Campus Stadium Ireland Development, the architect who designed the complex, or the centre&rsquo;s management company, Dublin Waterworld Limited?</P>
    <P>It appears that the children of Scoil Mochua and other people with a severe disability are victims of gross ineptitude on the part of Government. The centre was designed for the Special Olympics and was supposed to be a world class, state-of-the art facility. It is unbelievable that &euro;60 million plus of taxpayers&rsquo; money could have been spent on a pool, opened for the Special Olympics, which fails to meet fundamental disability access criteria.</P>
    <P>In most other jurisdictions a Minister responsible for this kind of fiasco would do the honourable thing and resign. Let us remember that this the centre whose roof blew off in a storm, where water has been leaking, where an almighty legal row continues and off-side arrangements with regard to the centre are costing taxpayers up to &euro;9 million a year in tax breaks. In any other jurisdiction the Minister responsible would resign, but instead the children of Scoil Mochua and other severely physically disabled people are faced with a Mexican stand-off between Campus Stadium Ireland and the pool&rsquo;s management company.</P>
    <P>The pool&rsquo;s management company, Dublin Waterworld Limited, claimed to have installed a hoist and lift for disabled access, but these are not fully useable because of access and design flaws such as narrow doors and the position of the plant equipment. It is over to the Taoiseach and the Minister to sort out this sorry saga.</P>
    <P>Swimming is part of the curriculum of Scoil Mochua. The Minister may not be aware, but Stewart&rsquo;s Hospital, St. Raphael&rsquo;s in Celbridge and Cheeverstown on the south side &mdash; all in the vicinity of Abbotstown &mdash; have smaller pools which are very important facilities. Although those pools were built years ago at a fraction of the cost of this world class facility at Abbotstown, they provide access for disabled people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will throw some light on this continuing shambles. I think we will wake up one day to find that the National <Col N="1926"/>Aquatic Centre has literally drained away. Part of it has already blown away and water is dripping out of it. It is a pity it is such a shambles because it should be a key facility.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is aware of the facts of this matter. On 22 November last, she received a full answer to two parliamentary questions which she had submitted on this issue. She had already received a letter from Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited outlining the circumstances of this case and giving details of the facilities which are available at the National Aquatic Centre. It has been explained to the Deputy that the centre was designed and built in accordance with the prescribed building regulations and to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited has confirmed that all requirements under disability legislation were met when the facility was being developed. The company consulted Special Olympics Ireland and all the other relevant interest groups during the project&rsquo;s design and build stages to ensure that the new facility would meet the requirements of disabled persons using it. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited has always tried to ensure that the National Aquatic Centre is accessible to everyone. As the landlord of the centre, the company&rsquo;s driving motivation at all times has been to ensure that this ambition is fulfilled. I assure the House, on behalf of the Government, that the National Aquatic Centre&rsquo;s facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. They can be and are regularly used by such people.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They cannot access the facilities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is anxious to ensure that access to the centre&rsquo;s splendid facilities is available to everyone, he has asked the board of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited to investigate whether further work can be done to meet the requirements of the people in question. At the Minister&rsquo;s direction, the company has undertaken a process in recent months that will lead to improved accessibility at the centre for people with severe disabilities.</P><Col N="1927"/>
    <P>The company arranged for experts to carry out an audit of access to the centre. The Deputy will be interested to learn that the report of the audit, which has been completed, stated: &ldquo;Accessibility to the centre is good.&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government publish the report?</P>
   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is intended that a list of further improvements will be agreed with the operators, to be put in place as quickly as possible. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, who is responsible for putting a state-of-the-art aquatic centre in place at Abbotstown, has made an unprecedented level of investment in sports facilities throughout the country. The National Aquatic Centre has drawn well deserved admiration from those who have visited it and used its facilities.</P>
    <P>We heard complaints for many years about this country&rsquo;s lack of proper sporting infrastructure. The Government has made a tangible contribution in this field since 1997 by providing for capital investment in sports facilities of more than &euro;600 million. The Government developed the National Aquatic Centre to provide a 50-metre pool for Ireland&rsquo;s needs and specifically to provide a suitable location for the aquatic events of the Special Olympics World Summer Games, which was achieved to universal acclaim.</P>
    <P>This wonderful facility provides a fantastic service to Deputy Burton&rsquo;s constituents, who are fortunate enough to have it on their doorsteps. Almost 1 million people visited the centre in its first year of operations, making it one of the top attractions in Ireland. It will continue to be a leading facility because it is planned to make its service even better by improving the facility further. Particular emphasis will be placed on providing the best possible service to people with disabilities, so that they can use it to the same extent as everyone else who enjoys the aquatic centre.</P>

    <sTitle>Planning Issues.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important issue, which relates to the perceived independence of a State body, An Bord Plean&aacute;la. It is vital, in the interests of proper planning and political support for the <Col N="1928"/>planning process, that An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be independent.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Roche, is aware that when An Bord Plean&aacute;la made its decision on the first planning application for a gas terminal building in Bellanaboy, the inspector came to the conclusion that the application was for the wrong site from a strategic planning perspective. The inspector said in his report that the site chosen by the company in question was the wrong one when considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s policy of fostering balanced regional development, from the perspective of minimising environmental impact and in the interests of sustainable development. More alarmingly, the inspector said he was under the impression that the granting of planning permission in this instance was a <i>fait accompli</i>. He concluded that the proposed site was unequivocally an incorrect choice.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that, according to briefing documents from a meeting five months later between the Taoiseach and Shell, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources acted as a bag carrier or messenger for the development company in question. The briefing document contains expressions of concern about An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s lack of understanding of many aspects of the projects and the petroleum sector. It refers to the fact that the company in question had lost money as a consequence of the delays caused by An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision. It highlights the serious reservations of the company, Enterprise Energy Ireland, about An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision and states that there were are no alternatives to the Corrib gas field.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what role, if any, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government played in asking An Bord Plean&aacute;la to give assurances that any further appeal decision would be considered with absolute urgency. The Department was able to present a memo at the meeting between the Taoiseach and representatives of Shell, stating that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had given a commitment to treat the appeal with utmost priority and to deliver a decision within 18 weeks, as statutorily required. I want the full details in this regard because it is vital that the planning process should be conducted in an open and fair manner. Anyone who examines from the outside the process that led to a decision being made on the appeal in this instance would agree that it was not conducted in an open and fair manner. The appellants, including those who represented the Green Party in the appeals process, did not have the same level of access to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the developer, which was able to make a presentation on the wonderful work it was doing.</P>
    <P>I have serious concerns that the Government constantly took Shell&rsquo;s side, in effect, throughout this process. The Taoiseach downgraded the role <Col N="1929"/>of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by proposing to introduce a critical infrastructure Bill. He continually expressed his support for the project in this forum and elsewhere. While such evidence is circumstantial &mdash; the Taoiseach is entitled to act on behalf of Shell &mdash; I contend that he put remarkable and untold pressure on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to accept the Government&rsquo;s will and to do the right thing in this case. It is to be deeply regretted that such actions have been bad for the long-term position of An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a credible and independent body. I am keen for the Minister to provide as many details as possible about this sorry process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Deputy Eamon Ryan for raising this matter and allowing me to put the facts on the record of the House. As Members are aware, An Bord Plean&aacute;la plays a key role in ensuring that major developments in Ireland are delivered in accordance with proper planning and sustainable development and in line with best land use practice. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the board is subject to a statutory objective to determine all matters before it within 18 weeks. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been assigned legislative responsibilities by the House relating to the timely delivery of planning decisions on strategically important infrastructure. Members of this House have encouraged the Taoiseach and me to speed up the preparation of the proposed strategic infrastructure Bill because they recognise the urgent need for a responsive planning process that does not take years to deliver critical decisions. Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s comments about the Bill represent a rather perverse movement away from the generality of the views held by Deputies.</P>
    <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has made major efforts over the last four years to clear its existing backlog of cases. Even though its intake of new cases increased by 11% in 2004, compared to 2003, the board met its statutory objective of deciding cases within 18 weeks in 85% of cases, compared to 74% of cases in 2003. The board has demonstrated that it is robust and more than capable of doing its job. An Bord Plean&aacute;la quite rightly gives special priority to major infrastructure projects &mdash; there is nothing new about that in legislative terms. The chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and his staff are to be congratulated on their exemplary record. The chairman attended today&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government to discuss the board&rsquo;s 2004 annual report and to brief the committee on the issues being faced by the board.</P>
    <P>In April 2003, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused planning permission for the terminal for the Corrib gas project on certain specific grounds, primarily relating to the issue of peat transfer and storage <Col N="1930"/>within the proposed site. Following that refusal, the company wrote to the Taoiseach indicating that it was considering the future status of the project. It indicated that the costs of the delays to the project had impacted seriously on its viability and that if it was to proceed it needed to be confident that future planning decisions would be taken in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Mayo county manager enclosing that letter and seeking their views on the issues regarding timely processing of the planning application which had been raised by the company. Both the chairman and the manager responded that any application would be treated expeditiously, as one would expect. The chairman stated that should an appeal be made to the board against a planning authority decision relating to a development of the Corrib gas field it would be afforded top priority by the board as an item of national infrastructure. However, the chairman also noted that his assurances on the timing of such an appeal were &ldquo;totally without prejudice to the consideration of any merits of any appeal by the Board&rdquo;. In other words, his reference was to the time limits and the manner in which an appeal would be handled. Copies of the letters exchanged on this matter between the Department and the board, and Mayo County Council, are available in the Oireachtas Library and I have passed copies to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, there is a bar on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government exercising any power or control in relation to any individual planning application or appeal with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned, with the exception that the Minister may comment on planning applications or appeals or give expert advice to planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the protection of the built and natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I make the point to the Deputy, in order that he can be assured on this matter, that it has been the practice of Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to respond even to their own constituents when they raise a query about planning in the terms of the paragraph I have just read. It is certainly my practice. It should be evident from what I have described, and from the content of the correspondence I am making available to the Oireachtas, that neither the Minister nor the Department has sought at any time to influence the decision taken by the local authority or the board on the planning application or appeal in question. I assure the House that, knowing as I do the members of the board and particularly the chairman of the board who is a fine public servant, any attempt to do so would be rejected.</P><Col N="1931"/>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that the Minister has a specific role under the 2000 Act of directing, if necessary, that the board should give priority to determining appeals relating to classes of development of special strategic, economic or social importance to the State. While no such <Col N="1932"/>direction has been issued to date, the Department&rsquo;s approach in the present case was in the context of this general statutory responsibility.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>the way in which and when he intends to legislate for open road tolling; and the distinction drawn between barrier free tolling and open road tolling.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Open road tolling, that is, the collection of tolls by automated means in a barrier free environment, is the optimal means of toll collection where the traffic volumes and toll revenues justify the investment required.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the need to change, where necessary, the legislative framework so as to facilitate the introduction of open road tolling. In particular, it is likely that legislation will be needed to implement appropriate deterrents for non payment of tolls in an open road tolling environment. I anticipate, subject to the other priorities on the legislative programme, that the draft legislation will be introduced early next year.</P>
    <P>Open road tolling implies that there are no toll booths for manual collection, that is, all tolls are collected by automated means. The only route where a move to full open road tolling, that is, no manual collection and barrier free, is being considered is the M50. Automated toll collection is currently in use on existing toll plazas and provides for one toll lane in each direction dedicated to the automated collection of tolls. A physical barrier is used on the lanes to prevent non-payment of tolls. A mixed operation toll plaza could involve both manual and automated lanes but without barriers on the automated lanes. I have made clear to the NRA that I am anxious to move to barrier free tolling on the M50 as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>Although there is no statutory basis for it, there is a long-<Col N="1934"/>standing convention that increases in standard single CIE fares of CIE and the RPA are approved by me. This control covers only the basic standard single journey fares for adults and children. It does not extend to return fares or to weekly, monthly or annual fares or to other concessionary, premium or promotional fares. The level of discount applied to these fares is a discretionary commercial decision for the board and management of CIE and its operating companies. Fare structures are a matter for the individual operating companies. The fares of private operators are not regulated by me.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Plans for a metro line from Tallaght via Kimmage to the city centre have not been dropped. Transport 21 provides for feasibility studies for this and other projects, including the proposed Luas line from the city centre to Dundrum via Terenure, over the course of the programme. While Transport 21 involves a very large commitment of financial resources, those resources are also finite. It has, therefore, been necessary to prioritise the investments to be made over the ten-year period. Tallaght is served at present by the Luas red line. The other areas mentioned by the Deputy are currently served by two QBCs, Rathfarnham and Tallaght, and a significant number of bus services.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 includes a substantial financial provision for the development of bus services and for the doubling of the quality bus network over the period of the programme.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 169 together.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s ten-year transport investment framework, Transport 21, which was launched recently, provides for significant funding for an expansion of public transport infrastructure and services. At the same time I will provide significant additional funding under the rural transport initiative, RTI, for public transport in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Since 2002, my Department has been operating the RTI, a pilot rural transport programme. Under the initiative, funding is provided for 34 rural community organisations throughout the country to address the public transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, administers the RTI on behalf of my Department. ADM and the individual RTI projects are solely responsible for all the operational aspects of the initiative, including the areas to be served by the RTI projects, and neither I nor my Department have any role in these matters.</P>
    <P>I have provided &euro;4.5 million in funding for the RTI in 2005, which is a 50% increase on the 2004 allocation and I will provide &euro;5 million for the initiative in 2006. By the end of 2005 total funding for the initiative will have been over &euro;13 million which compares with the original proposed allocation of &euro;4.4 million in the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I announced the extension of the pilot phase of the initiative to the end of 2006. In this I was taking account of the principal recommendation of the appraisal of the RTI, carried out in 2004. I also announced that from 2007 onwards I intend to put the scheme on a permanent footing. Pending the conclusion of the pilot phase of the RTI, it is not proposed to expand the number of RTI projects.</P>
    <P>I have already announced that in parallel with the implementation of Transport 21, I will double the cash funding available to the scheme by 2007. Thereafter, I will steadily increase the funding available for rural transport services, ultimately <Col N="1936"/>to a cash level about four times what it is this year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the roll-out of a permanent structure for the delivery of rural transport services in the post 2006 period are currently under consideration in my Department. When finalised, they will be the subject of a public consultation process. In developing these proposals, I will pay particular attention to the transport needs of rural areas that are not currently served by public transport.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 includes the completion of the Luas line from Sandyford to Cherrywood by 2010 and from Cherrywood to Bray by 2015. Subject to compliance with the relevant statutory procedures, I expect construction of the Cherrywood extension to start during 2006. On 7 November 2005, I received an application from the Railway Procurement Agency for a railway order in respect of a proposed Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood. I have directed that a public inquiry be held into the application and an inspector to conduct the public inquiry has been appointed.</P>
    <P>While the proposed extensions will not be developed as public private partnerships, I expect that the private sector will fund a significant proportion of the cost through,<i> inter alia</i>, levies on developers under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Pending completion of planning work, public consultation and the statutory approval process, it is not possible to be precise about the location of the terminus at Bray.</P>

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 30, and 40 together.</P>
    <P>It is a key aim of the Department of Transport to develop an integrated transport system that will be an attractive alternative to the private car and help to minimise traffic congestion in urban areas. Provision of adequate park and ride facilities at appropriate locations around the country is an essential component in achieving this goal. In this context, Transport 21 includes substantial funding for traffic management measures, including a provision for doubling of park and ride sites in the greater Dublin area and for park and ride sites in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Furthermore, this summer I approved the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, strategy for the development of rail-based park and ride facilities in the greater Dublin area, GDA, and included a provision that bus-based park and ride will also be considered.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be in a position to say that my Department will provide capital funding for the development of new park and ride facilities across the country. The allocation of funding to specific projects will be subject to the submission to my Department of proposals from private or public bodies based on comprehensive business cases. Among other criteria, applications will be evaluated in the light of the strategic benefit of each proposed location from the perspectives of public transport provision and traffic congestion relief. It is not possible to say at this juncture that park and ride facilities at each and every railway station will be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Financial provision has been made for park and ride in Transport 21. However, it is not possible pending the receipt of specific applications to predict the cost of individual proposals or the total number of spaces which will ultimately be made available. My Department has received several expressions of interest regarding potential park and ride projects, and expects to receive specific proposals in the near future, which will then be evaluated.</P>
    <P>Apart from specific proposals for funding which may be submitted on the basis set out above, park and ride will also be provided as part <Col N="1938"/>of major transport projects, such as the Cork suburban rail and Kildare route projects. The question of providing shuttle bus services to rail stations will be considered as part of the bus investment programme under Transport 21. As I indicated at the launch of Transport 21, the role of the bus will change as the major rail investments are completed, with a greater emphasis on orbital, feeder and local bus services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 20, 32, 57 and 178 together.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, in its decision of 18 May the Government agreed to the State disposing of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus and retaining a stake of at least 25% to protect strategic interests provided that both myself and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that this level of disposal is warranted on foot of the analysis prepared by the Department&rsquo;s advisers for the transaction.</P>
    <P>Following a competitive tender process, UBS and AIB Capital Markets were appointed to provide financial advice and assistance to both myself and the Minister for Finance in relation to an Aer Lingus sale-investment transaction. William Fry Solicitors and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer were appointed as legal advisers for the assignment.</P>
    <P>Work on phase 1 of the assignment is currently at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed in December 2005. This phase involves recommending the most appropriate transaction mechanism, including advice on its size, type and timing which will then be considered by myself and the Minister for Finance. Phase 2 of the advisers assignment will involve the execution of the chosen transaction.</P><Col N="1939"/>
    <P>For its part, in accordance with the Government decision of 18 May, Aer Lingus is currently preparing a plan for future growth on the basis that additional equity capital will be available within a reasonable timescale. The company has appointed Goldman Sachs and Merrion Capital as financial advisers to provide advice and assistance in the context of the investment process.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to timing, and subject to the views and recommendations put forward by the advisers, I recognise the need for an early completion of a transaction to support Aer Lingus&rsquo;s new plan for growth and in the context of a move to open skies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 66 and 97 together.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the delivery of a high quality, effective public transport system in which buses will continue to play a central role. At the launch of Transport 21, I said that I was convinced that we need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority with the power to ensure joined-up thinking and delivery across all transport modes. In pursuit of that objective, I have appointed a team chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed authority. When considering the remit of the authority, I have asked the team to have regard to the importance of timely and effective implementation of the Transport 21 investment programme in the greater Dublin area, of delivering an integrated transport system and of ensuring effective inter-agency co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>As regards modernising the regulatory framework governing public transport, officials in my Department have held extensive discussions with <Col N="1940"/>representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and the private bus sector, along with other stakeholders during 2005. In the light of my proposals for a Dublin transport authority, there is also a need to ensure that proposals in that regard are coherent with the institutional arrangements being made for the implementation of Transport 21, particularly in the greater Dublin area. I will review how best to proceed with public transport reform and the proposal for a public transport commission after Professor O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s team has reported and the Government has made decisions on the proposed transport authority for the greater Dublin area.</P>

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1997, this Government has been implementing a sustained programme to develop key elements of our transport system and reduce congestion. Transport 21 has secured funding for a major public transport investment programme designed to inject a large amount of additional capacity into the public transport network over the next ten years. Existing programmes, such as my Department&rsquo;s traffic management grants scheme will ensure continued and enhanced funding, through the DTO, to local authorities and the quality bus network office, for investment in traffic management schemes throughout the greater Dublin area. The main objective of this scheme is to improve operating conditions for the fleet of buses serving the GDA. A major investment in additional bus capacity is also planned which will be used to meet the immediate and short term requirements for additional public transport while other infrastructure is being put in place.</P>
    <P>The opening of the Dublin Port tunnel in mid-2006 will have a positive impact on Dublin&rsquo;s traffic removing substantial volumes of heavy goods vehicles daily from our roads. This will not only help to ease congestion on the roads network but will also ensure greater road safety in the city centre and residential areas.

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 82 together.</P>
    <P>The question of the adoption of changes in the circumstances where the driver of a vehicle can be made the subject of a preliminary roadside breath test has been the subject of considerable debate and consideration for some time.</P>
    <P>The current road safety strategy recommends that the introduction of random breath testing should be pursued within its operational time frame of 2004 to 2006. Against that background, my Department is examining the development of a scheme for a more general basis for roadside testing in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Drink driving laws are regularly challenged in the higher courts so it is important that any such initiative can withstand legal challenge. This requires that a balance be struck such that measures aimed at reducing road fatalities, which are clearly for the common good, are proportional in that they have proper regard to the legal rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>I wish to find an approach to extending the scope of roadside breath testing in a manner which, both has regard to the legal concerns regarding proportionality, but also gives garda&iacute; significant additional scope to demand that motorists submit to roadside breath testing.</P>
    <P>I recently met the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and party spokespersons for a discussion focused solely on this issue at which I outlined the legal concerns as I <Col N="1942"/>understand them. I am endeavouring to work with my colleagues on the committee to find a solution to this issue which crosses party boundaries.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, garda&iacute; are empowered to require that all drivers involved in road collisions or detected committing any traffic offences must submit to road-side breath tests. This is in addition to the power to demand that a driver who in the opinion of a garda has consumed alcohol must submit to such a test.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the road safety strategy to advance random breath testing represents one of a number of linked initiatives in the area of drink driving that will be pursued together. These include a specific proposal for an increase in the charge imposed by the courts under section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, on those convicted of drink driving as a contribution towards the costs of the medical bureau of road safety in carrying out their analysis.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 46, 72, 81, 182 and 187 together.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 is a fully costed programme. The &euro;34.4 billion cost is based on the aggregate cost <Col N="1944"/>of the constituent projects and these are in turn primarily based on costs provided by the transport agencies. However, I do not propose to release this commercially sensitive information until the public procurement processes for the individual projects are completed. Some elements of Transport 21, such as traffic management, have global financial provisions rather than individual project allocations.</P>
    <P>Since 2002 the Department has undertaken substantial work on integration in consultation with other Departments and State agencies. This work takes account of Government policy documents, particularly the national spatial strategy 2002 and the regional planning guidelines. The result was a set of guiding principles for integrated transport policy, which is published in our current statement of strategy. These principles provided a policy backdrop for the preparation of the integrated investment strategy contained in Transport 21.</P>
    <P>In addition, in preparing Transport 21, my Department took account of the work already done on investment priorities under the existing capital envelope to end 2009 and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the national road needs study. The Department also engaged with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority, the Dublin Transportation Office and relevant Departments in order to identify the broad direction and priorities of the investment framework.</P>
    <P>The result of this work is a transport investment strategy which for the first time addresses Exchequer capital expenditure in an integrated way across modes, and which emphasises connectivity and which provides for the development of an integrated transport network in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>My Department will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of Transport 21 by the various transport agencies and local authorities. A monitoring group is being established which will be chaired by my Department. The group will include representatives of the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and other relevant Government Departments and agencies. It will be responsible for the high-level monitoring of Transport 21 and for reporting annually to Government on issues such as financial and physical progress.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we also need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority, with real powers to ensure joined up thinking and delivery across all the transport modes. A team, chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony and reporting directly to me, has been appointed and charged with finalising a structure for the new transport authority, detailing its remit and responsibilities as well as identifying the human resources which <Col N="1945"/>are critical to the success of the body taking into account best practice and best experience internationally.</P>
    <P>In recent times, the majority of transport projects have being coming in on budget, with many ahead of schedule, and this augurs well for the implementation of Transport 21. Nevertheless significant safeguards will be implemented to ensure that Transport 21 is delivered within budget.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, projects within Transport 21 will be subject to capital appraisal in line with Department of Finance guidelines and the value for money initiatives set out in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s speech of 20 October last. Transport 21 clearly sets out the completion dates of key projects. On the basis of the preparatory work that has been undertaken, I am satisfied that those dates are both realistic and achievable. My primary focus is on ensuring that the completion deadlines are fully met. It is the responsibility of the relevant implementing agencies to identify the project milestones necessary to achieve these completion deadlines. The structures that I am putting in place &mdash; the new transport authority for Dublin and the high-level monitoring group &mdash; will assist in ensuring that projects are delivered in the timeframes already published.</P>
    <P>There has been no shortage of public debate about the future direction of transport investment policy. A number of significant studies have been published which contributed to that debate, including the strategic studies I mentioned earlier and other studies such as those on the western rail corridor. The Government has taken account of all these inputs and has decided the future direction of transport investment. The focus now needs to be on delivery and not on further debate. Of course, the individual projects included in Transport 21 will be the subject of public consultation and the normal statutory approval processes.</P>
    <P>No consultancy costs were incurred by my Department in the development of Transport 21 as the Department did not engage any consultants or other advisers for this purpose. However, my Department did benefit from the advice of Goodbody Economic Consultants who were engaged before work on the investment framework commenced, to review the business cases submitted by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in support of various projects, including its greater Dublin integrated rail network proposals, much of which is included in Transport 21.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish a more detailed document on Transport 21 in due course and this will involve printing and translation costs. Also, there were costs associated with the launch of Transport 21, details of which I gave to the House in response to Parliamentary Question No. 277 of 9 November 2005.</P>

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 16 of the Road Transport Act 1999 provides for an on-the-spot fine in lieu of prosecution for offences under the Road Transport Acts and EU regulations on drivers&rsquo; hours and rest periods.</P>
    <P>The commencement of this section has been the subject of discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and the advice now is that a provision in primary legislation will be required to ensure compatibility with current fixed penalty charges legislation before the proposed fines system can be brought into effect.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in contact with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office with a view to including a suitable provision in the Road Safety Authority Bill. Such a provision would provide the basis for introduction of the fines system by ministerial regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to road safety legislation, the European Union rules governing drivers&rsquo; hours and the use of tachograph recording equipment in heavy goods vehicles and large buses, promote road safety by prescribing minimum breaks and rest periods and limiting the amount of time spent driving. Enforcement of these rules is by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by a dedicated team of transport officers from my Department at the premises of the operator and at roadside.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has tabled proposals to update the existing drivers&rsquo; hours rules and to significantly increase the quality and quantity of enforcement checks that must be carried out by member states. These proposals are currently in the conciliation procedure between the Council and the European Parliament with a view to finding a compromise leading to final adoption. I am satisfied that once adopted, the measures proposed will result in greater levels of drivers&rsquo; hours monitoring and, through the introduction of the digital tachograph, a more secure and tamper proof system of controlling drivers and ensuring adequate rest and breaks.</P>
    <P>While enforcement of drivers&rsquo; hours rules clearly makes a contribution to safer driving, the ultimate qualification standard is the HGV driver licence, which shows that a driver has trained and passed a recognised level of competence in relation to the particular vehicle classification covered by the licence.</P>
    <P>EU Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the training of professional drivers, will require professional bus and lorry drivers to follow a programme of professional driver training. The training will be compulsory for all persons seeking to become professional drivers and will comprise of training for an initial qualification followed by periodic <Col N="1949"/>refresher training equivalent to one day training per annum. Member states have until 10 September 2006 to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive. Such enhanced training regimes will make a further contribution to road safety in relation to the operation of heavy goods vehicles and buses.</P>
    <P>As regards vehicle standards, an extensive range of requirements must be satisfied in order to use a HGV or bus in a public place. In this regard, all HGVs and buses are required to comply with statutory requirements relating to the construction, equipment and use of vehicles as set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996.</P>
    <P>Safety standards applied under these regulations relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to maximum dimensions, overall vehicle weight and axle weight limits, the fitment of speed limiters, and, in the case of buses, maximum passenger accommodation including the circumstances where standing passengers may be carried. Notwithstanding the general speed limits that apply to vehicles, HGVs and single deck buses are subject to a maximum speed limit of 80 km/h with double deck buses subject to a maximum speed of 65 km/h. HGVs and buses over one year old are liable to annual roadworthiness testing in accordance with the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 2004.</P>

     <Quest>if the proposed new transport authority to be established by Ms Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony of Trinity College Dublin will have a national remit or if it will exclusively be involved in transport planning within the greater Dublin area; the proposed future role of the Dublin Transportation Office in relation to the new authority; and the way in which the new authority will be able to incorporate land use planning considerations in its role.</Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 69 and 76 together.</P>
    <P>The reduction in funding in 2006 under subhead C3 of my Department&rsquo;s Vote arises because the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, will not require any operating subsidy for the Luas. Additionally, the RPA had to make an exceptional payment in 2005 towards the funding of a pension scheme deficit which will not recur in 2006. The capital and current funding provided in 2006 will be adequate to enable the RPA carry out its remit under Transport 21.</P>
    <P>On 6 November last, I announced the appointment of a team led by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony, charged with establishing a new transport authority for the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The team will finalise a structure for the new transport authority, detailing its remit and responsibilities as well as identifying the human resources which are critical to the success of the body, taking into account best practice and best experience internationally. In this context, it will be a matter for the team to make recommendations in relation to the Dublin Transportation Office. The new authority will have responsibility for transport in the greater Dublin area. However it is not intended that the authority will have a role in land use planning.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made in my Department&rsquo;s 2006 Estimate for the proposed transport authority for Dublin pending the outcome of the work being undertaken by the establishment team. However, I intend to bring proposals to the Government for decision as soon as I have considered the report of the team. The funding requirements for the new authority will be considered by the Government at that time.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to promoting cycling, as is made clear in the Programme for Government, and it is Government policy to make provision for the bicycle as a separate mode in the design and maintenance of roads. The provision of cycle ways and cycle parking is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the greater Dublin area, GDA, funding for cycling is provided to local authorities in the area through the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, traffic management grants scheme. Some &euro;29 million has been provided by the Exchequer for the provision of cycling facilities in the GDA since 1994. Overall, there are now 300 kilometres of cycle networks in the GDA.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of a decline in cycling over recent years, although the decline in the greater Dublin area, where cycling investment is highest, is not as pronounced as in other cities. Funding for cycling facilities will be provided through the enhanced traffic management grants provision in Transport 21, subject to the outcome of a review of cycling policy, including the effectiveness of existing public investment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 50, 59, 61 and 77 together.</P>
    <P>The operation of the penalty points system commenced with effect from 31 October 2002 in respect of speeding offences and has subsequently been extended to apply to the offences of driving without insurance, careless driving and offences relating to the non-wearing of seat belts. Since its introduction over 278,700 drivers have incurred penalty points.</P>
    <P>Extensive ongoing consultation is taking place between my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Courts Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in order to finalise draft regulations and a commencement order for the extension of the fixed charge and the penalty point systems respectively. A meeting of all the agencies involved took place on 17 November.</P>
    <P>The extension of the penalty point system to other offences under the Road Traffic Acts will be progressively commenced once the appropriate Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na IT processing system is fully operational and related administrative supports are in place. The delivery of those measures is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform respectively.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have indicated to my officials that the systems in question will be operational by April next year. I have asked <Col N="1955"/>my officials to continue liaising with their colleagues and those agencies, to seek to advance the date of next April if at all possible.</P>
    <P>The majority of penalty point offences will also attract fixed charges. Therefore, in addition to the making of orders to facilitate the application of penalty points to offences from a particular commencement date, regulations to extend the operation of the fixed charge system to relevant penalty point offences will also be made. Those regulations will also facilitate the application of the fixed charge system to all of the offences that are currently the subject of the on the spot fine system.</P>

    <P>The group&rsquo;s report, which was published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on website <i>www.justice.ie </i>on 2 August 2005, provides a clear template for the pursuit of this initiative on the grounds of the promotion of road safety.</P>
    <P>The group&rsquo;s recommendations include the establishment of clear management structures both at the strategic and operational levels under the general supervision of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, it proposes that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will make the site selection for the placement of cameras with the assistance of the National Roads Authority. The criteria for site selection will be grounded on collision history and the history of speeding incidents. The group has also recommended that there can be no connection between the receipts of fixed charge payments resulting from detections by privately operated cameras and the funding of the operation.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan, NDP, provides for an increase in capacity and the improvement in the quality, reliability, frequency and speed of bus services in the Dublin region. The investment programme involved the expansion of the bus network to meet demand, through the phased purchase of additional buses to increase passenger capacity and meet the development requirements of the network.</P>

My Department has had preliminary discussions with Dublin Bus regarding future network and service developments. The company is expected to submit a business case for additional fleet requirements shortly which will need to have regard to the emerging findings of the network review. The financial provisions for bus investment in Transport 21 will now supercede the provisions in the NDP.</P>

     <Quest>in relation to the recent announcement that the new Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway will lift its toll barriers if there is a build-up of five or more cars, his views on whether this new arrangement should be extended to the East and West Link toll bridges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority, NRA, under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the NRA that a strict performance regime is provided for in current PPP contracts &mdash; for example, the M1 and M4/M6 Kilcock-Kinnegad &mdash; to ensure compliance with requirements, including level of service provisions. Defaults in performance by the PPP company lead to the imposition of a financial penalty together with the award of points under a penalty points system which may trigger increased levels of monitoring at the PPP company&rsquo;s cost and ultimately contract termination. These provisions incentivise the PPP company to maintain high service levels but the agreement does not require the lifting of barriers if queues arise.</P>
    <P>As regards the West-Link toll bridge, the service obligations contained in this agreement, which date back to the 1980s, are not as developed or as comprehensive as those contained in current PPP contracts. In the context of the overall upgrade of the M50, the NRA is currently engaged in negotiations with NTR on the upgrade of that section of the M50 operated by NTR, including a move to open road tolling at Westlink. Issues relating to the operation of the <Col N="1959"/>East Link bridge are matters for Dublin City Council and NTR.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 58 together.</P>
    <P>The reduction in current expenditure for regional airports in the 2006 Estimates reflects the reduced level of subvention required under the new PSO air service contracts, which came into force in July 2005.</P>
    <P>Under the new PSO regime, annual subvention required for all six PSO routes is reduced from approximately &euro;20 million to approximately &euro;15 million. The reduction in subvention was achieved taking account of an expenditure review of the escalating costs of the PSO regime and following the development of revised programme specifications and a competitive procurement process.</P>
    <P>There should be no negative impact on PSO services under the new programme. The service timetables and frequency of flights remain largely unchanged from arrangements in previous years. New standards of punctuality and operational performance have been introduced which should contribute to a general improvement in service provision.</P>
    <P>The 2006 Estimates also make provision for operational and capital grant assistance for the regional airports. Some &euro;2.24 million will be available towards operational expenditure and &euro;4 million will be available to assist with safety and security related infrastructure under the NDP.</P>
    <P>The approved NDP projects, which I announced earlier this year, are being undertaken in the 2005-07 period and total funding of &euro;12 million will be available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Any additional funding for regional airports in subsequent years under Transport 21 will be considered in the context of Department of Finance capital appraisal guidelines and EU guidelines on financing of airports and start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports.</P>

	<P>Hard shoulder use by buses will be piloted at a number of locations including the northbound and southbound approaches to Dunshaughlin, at Bracetown between Dunshaughlin and Clonee in County Meath, and at various locations on the Naas Road in the South Dublin County Council area.</P>
    <P>I understand from the quality bus network office that construction works are being carried out in 2005 on the following hard shoulder bus lane schemes: Navan Road, approaches to Dunshaughlin and Bracetown section; Naas Road, Kingswood Interchange to Kylemore Road.</P>
    <P>To facilitate usage of hard shoulders in the manner proposed, my Department included a provision in the Road Traffic Act 2004 to enable local authorities to apply different speed limits to separate lanes on a road, and in April of this year I issued statutory guidelines for the application of special speed limits.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, my Department, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, devised road signs for use at the pilot locations. National roll-out of the measure will depend on the success of the pilot schemes.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The estimated carryover of up to &euro;100 million in capital funding for transport projects from 2005 to 2006, which amounts to approximately 6% of the total capital invested in transport projects in 2005, is attributable to less than anticipated expenditure on the national roads programme due to delays in concluding land deals, delays in the tendering processes for projects and delays on projects such as the Waterford city by-pass and Clonee-Kells on the M3. It is not possible at this stage to assign specific amounts to individual projects. The delays reflect timing issues and the challenges associated with managing contingency provisions in a complete multi-annual programme. As the multi-annual capital envelope process is in use it is not expected that there will be a significant impact on the delivery of the programme.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 150 on the 19 October 2005. The North-South work programme which was agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North. However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain. For that reason, it was agreed early in 2003 that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.</P>
    <P>The development of a system of mutual recognition of penalty points presents complex legal questions and will require the negotiation of a bilateral agreement between the two Governments and probably the passage of primary legislation to support such an agreement. For that reason, my Department has sought and obtained the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in relation to this issue which will inform future consideration of the issue.</P>

	<P>Proposals developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction will involve a test of the competence of individual instructors. A working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests has formulated the design of the standards that a driving instructor must meet. The standard will set out criteria for entry to the driving instructor profession and the three part exam comprising a written exam, a practical driving test and a test of instructional capability that instructors will have to pass in order to be registered.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for implementing the standard of driving instruction and establishing a register of driving instructors will be with the proposed road safety authority. I am considering what arrangements will be put in place to oversee implementation of the standard in the context of the establishment of the authority. As part of this process the standard referred to will form the basis for a consultation document to be issued early next year which will set out the requirements with which driving instructors will have to comply in order to be registered.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides for significant investment in increased bus capacity in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Substantial demographic changes have taken place in Dublin in recent years, and there has also been a significant increase in rail capacity, Luas, commuter rail services and the DART upgrade. For these reasons, it is necessary to identify what should be the response of bus to these and future changes. Therefore, I asked Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath earlier this year to review the bus network, with a view to deciding on future fleet requirements and how services can best be configured to meet the changing needs of the market. I expect the review to be completed early in 2006.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of this review, I have already approved funding for an initial tranche of 20 additional buses which will go into service before the end of the year. My Department has had preliminary discussions with Dublin Bus regarding future network and service developments. The company is expected to submit a business case for additional fleet requirements shortly which will need to have regard to the emerging findings of the network review.</P>

	<P>In order to reduce the current unacceptable and exceptional backlog of persons awaiting a driving test, my Department and the Department of Finance developed a package of measures to deal with the problem. The package includes a bonus scheme for driver testers, the recruitment of additional testers as well as the outsourcing of a block of tests. The package has the potential to deliver up to 80,000 additional driving tests with 40,000 tests being delivered by outsourcing.</P>
    <P>Tenders for a contract to conduct driving tests have been received and a preferred tender has been selected. However, the matter has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission to facilitate conciliation under Sustaining Progress. The first conciliation hearing was held on 21 October 2005 and reconvened on 25 October 2005.</P>
    <P>The conciliation hearing has been adjourned until 25 November to allow a detailed examination by both parties of the feasibility of having tests carried out by staff redeployed on a short-term basis from outside the Department of Transport. In this period the Department will also explore issues around the outsourcing proposal.</P>
    <P>The recruitment process for testers is under way and I expect additional testers to be trained and operational by May 2006. The bonus scheme is designed to deliver 40,000 additional tests in a 12 month period and I anticipate that another 40,000 tests could be delivered by July 2007 through outsourcing.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Road Safety Strategy 2004-06 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003 period. Achievement of the target would result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is an ambitious target and one which will require the continued commitment to a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies.</P>
    <P>The recent increase in road deaths, however, is a cause of concern and places the challenge of meeting the target set for the end of 2006 into stark focus. As of midnight on 21 November, 353 people lost their lives on our roads this year, an increase of 22 fatalities on the same period last year. If we are to realise the end 2006 target, a significant reversal of this worrying trend must be achieved.</P>
    <P>Progress depends in the first instance on a continued emphasis on the approach that underpins the strategy. A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing remains the correct approach and these remain the key areas of the new strategy.</P>
    <P>Significant initiatives identified in the strategy that have been realised to date include the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits through the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and the establishment of the new Garda traffic corps. The new speed limits structure featured a reduction in the speed limit in all rural, regional and local roads from 60 mph to 80 km/h, which equates to 50 mph. The establishment of the dedicated traffic corps last year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under a distinct management structure under the command of an Assistant Commissioner addresses a particular commitment given by the Government. The corps, when it is fully staffed, will provide the basis for the achievement of the significant gains in road safety that emanate from consistent high levels of traffic law enforcement.</P>
    <P>Other major proposals identified in the strategy such as the plans to establish a system of private sector operation of speed cameras under the auspices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the <Col N="1971"/>further extension of the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems are being advanced and the question of the introduction of a more general basis for the carrying out of preliminary roadside alcohol testing of drivers is being considered.</P>
    <P>We are making progress across the wide range of initiatives identified in the strategy and I am satisfied that all of the agencies involved are fully committed to the achievement of the goals that underpin the strategy.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 includes a metro line from the city centre to Swords <i>via</i> Dublin Airport, metro north, and an orbital metro route, metro west, linking Tallaght with Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Ballymun. Metro north and west will be developed as public private partnerships, PPPs. It is likely that the infrastructure will be procured on the basis of a design, build, finance and maintain, DBFM, PPP, with a separate PPP contract for the operation of services. The PPP consortia that win the infrastructure contracts will finance the capital cost of the project, probably through a mix of borrowings and equity. The consortia will be paid by the Exchequer over a period of years, usually in the region of 25 years. Payments will not begin until the service commences, thus incentivising the consortium to deliver early. These payments will cover the costs of the consortia including construction, infrastructure maintenance and renewal and financing costs. The consortia will be responsible for ensuring that the projects are delivered on time and that the infrastructure is available for service over the full period of the contract to the required standard.</P>
    <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, is at present preparing a detailed implementation plan for the metro north line. This includes the preparation of a public sector benchmark. The implementation plan will also include public consultation, which will commence in early 2006.</P>

     <Quest>the way in which the final determinations in respect of each health board for 2004 were discharged and in particular the way in which the proportion formerly paid in the following year under subhead 5 of her Department&rsquo;s Vote was dealt with following the dissolution of the boards; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the enactment of legislation to establish the Health Service Executive, HSE, from 1 January 2005, the HSE became a Vote holder. That legislation also provided for the dissolution of the health boards and required the HSE to prepare the final annual financial statements, AFS, for the former health boards. The legislation also provided for the transfer of health board assets and liabilities to the HSE.</P>
    <P>In December 2004, final determinations were notified to the health boards for that year, as required under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996. The Abridged Estimates Volume, AEV, for 2005, published in November 2004, provided for that portion of the health boards&rsquo; approved 2004 final determinations paid in the following year in the sum of &euro;685.458 million, <Col N="1976"/>under subhead B5. The establishment of a separate HSE Vote 40 in the Health Act 2004, as published in the Revised Estimates volume, REV, 2005, provided for the same sum of &euro;685.458 million. However, this sum was apportioned across the new subheads B1 to B9 in REV 2005, thus eliminating the previous subhead B5 but making full provision for 2004 balances.</P>
    <P>The funding in Vote 40 for 2005, therefore, provided that specific sum for the full discharge of liabilities coming forward from the former health boards for payment in 2005. It follows that Vote 40 will in future contain a provision for the discharge of its liabilities coming forward from the previous year.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste <Col N="1977"/>and I am aware of, and acknowledge, the services provided by Lucan Disability Action Group. The T&aacute;naiste has met this group in recent months. The group has been in receipt of funding from F&Aacute;S for the past numbers of years under the social economy programme. I understand there is potential for the organisation to seek continuing funding from F&Aacute;S, albeit at a reduced rate, for 2006.</P>
    <P>While Lucan Disability Action Group has not been in receipt of funding from the Health Service Executive, HSE, to date in respect of the services that they provide, these services complement the range of supports already provided by the HSE to persons with disabilities in the Lucan area. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the group should engage with the HSE with a view to entering into an agreement for the provision of services to be funded by the executive in accordance with its functions under the Health Act 2004. The group has been made aware of this.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 113 and 116 together.</P>
    <P>Government approved the appointment of Dr. Deirdre Madden, a distinguished expert on medical law and ethics, on 3 May 2005 to provide me with a report on post mortem policy and practice by 21 December 2005. I understand Dr. Madden will meet her deadline and I intend that, subject to legal advice, her report will be made public.</P>
    <P>In late 1999, my Department wrote to all health boards and hospitals requesting that they ensure a policy of informed consent should operate regarding the retention of organs following post mortem examination, pending the issue of guidelines by the faculty of pathology. These guidelines for post mortem consent and retention of tissues at post mortem examination were issued by the faculty in February, 2000. The Health Service Executive has confirmed that guidelines and protocols are in place for families in the case of both coroners&rsquo; and non-coroners&rsquo; post mortems. In accordance with these guidelines, families are to be informed when retention takes place in a coroner&rsquo;s post mortem and permission is to be sought to retention in the case of a non-coroner&rsquo;s post mortem.</P>
    <P>Funding for Parents for Justice, PFJ, is now a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the HSE is in talks with PFJ regarding future funding. I am aware, however, that Parents for Justice received approximately &euro;1.3 million in funding since 2000, which includes funding of &euro;330,000 for 2005.</P>

	<P>Employment information for the health service is collected through the health services personnel census on a quarterly basis and the latest available verified data is in respect of end-June 2005, when employment levels stood at 100,934 personnel in whole-time equivalent terms. The census collects data in respect of actual employment and does not include information on persons working on a contract for service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that there is no embargo on recruitment in the heath service and that approved employment levels for the health service have been adjusted in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels for patients. The employment ceiling for the health service currently stands at 97,550, in whole-time equivalent terms. This ceiling reflects not only the 600 post adjustment required by the Government decision on public sector numbers in 2002 but also includes an increase of 1,200 posts in respect of the opening of new units in 2005. Further increases in the employment ceiling for the health service in 2005 are being finalised by my Department and the Department of Finance in respect of both the accident and emergency initiative and the Disabilities Act 2005.</P>
    <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, HSE, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the management of health service staffing in line with the employment ceiling, service plan priorities and new developments. Accordingly, my Department has requested the HSE&rsquo;s acting national director of human resources to investigate the matter raised and reply directly to the Deputy in respect of the HSE.</P><Col N="1984"/>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
     <Quest>if he will remove the condition that has been imposed on many confined competitions that all successful candidates must undertake to decentralise in order that the principle of the voluntary nature of decentralisation can be maintained.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004 provides for the transfer of 10,300 Civil Service and public sector posts from Dublin to other locations. Almost all Departments are involved, either wholly or partly. A number of semi-State organisations are also involved in the programme.</P>
    <P>The programme is voluntary, that is, staff may opt to decentralise with their post or to another post in a decentralised location, or they may opt to remain in Dublin. The relocation requirement that the Deputy refers to is not in any way inconsistent with the voluntary nature of the decentralisation programme. The general principle that promotees should, in view of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, be asked to accept their new appointment on the basis of agreement to relocate with their posts is the subject of continuing discussions between management and the Civil Service unions.</P>
    <P>A draft agreement on the filling of posts through promotion has been under discussion between management and the Civil Service unions for some time. The draft agreement covers both inter-departmental promotion competitions and internal promotions. In relation to inter-departmental promotions, all appointees from such competitions must agree to re-locate with their new post. In relation to internal promotions, where a Department is decentralising in its entirety, from 52 weeks before decentralisation, all promotions in the Department will be made on the basis of a written commitment by promotees to relocate; where a Department is partially decentralising, from 52 weeks before decentralisation, one half of all promotions will be made on that basis.</P>
    <P>Pending final agreement with the Civil Service unions and to ensure that the staffing needs of Departments and offices continue to be met, inter-departmental competitions are currently being held on the basis of this draft agreement. <Col N="1985"/>In addition, Departments and offices have been asked by the Department of Finance to follow the procedures in the draft in relation to internal promotions. It is expected that the agreement will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that there are also a number of particular cases in which Civil Service unions and staff are seeking confined competitions to appoint unestablished staff, who are, in many instances, employed on contract, to established posts within the Civil Service. As the general principle that promotees should be asked to agree to decentralise is now being implemented in both inter-departmental and internal promotions in accordance with the draft agreement, it is clearly essential that the possibility of applying the same condition in these cases should also be considered. These cases are being examined by the Department of Finance and the relevant Departments and Office. They are also being discussed with the relevant trade unions.</P>

These re-engagements have been on the basis that they were of short duration, and the former employees were brought back on the basis of the skills or expertise they were able to bring to particular projects. Given the small number and duration of these re-engagements, I am satisfied that these do not have any impact on staffing or on recruitment or numbers policy.</P>

They require that the <Col N="1990"/>drivers and others involved in the carriage of the dangerous goods by road, including their packing, loading, filling, transport and unloading be adequately trained and, in the case of drivers, hold certificates of such. The draft regulations also contain provisions on an EU harmonised approach to the road checks aspect of their enforcement.</P>

	<P>The Labour Court is an independent statutory body and acts independently in carrying out its functions. I am therefore not at liberty to discuss individual cases that are due to be heard by the court even if I had reason to do so. However I understand that a recommendation on more than just the issue of redundancy was issued by the Labour Court to the parties on 21 November 2005. This recommendation, LRC18404, is confidential until 29 November 2005 to allow both parties time to consider its contents. The Deputy may wish to inform himself of the outcome of this hearing. However, if the Deputy has any specific information of which my Department should be aware, I invite him to supply it.</P>

	<P>A small number of former employees of my Department and its agencies <Col N="1991"/>have been brought back to work on contract, or others employed on contract to do work which, in some cases, was traditionally done in-house. This includes a number of temporary staff engaged each year to provide cover for staff availing of term-time work options, to provide maternity cover and staff engaged on short-term contracts to undertake specific assignments.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice of my Department or its agencies to engage former employees and, or others on a contract basis unless it is absolutely necessary to do so and only occurs where the relevant expertise would not be currently available in-house. Where such staff are engaged, it is not done with the intention of circumventing the Government&rsquo;s staff numbers reduction programme rather it is to ensure that an optimum quality of service continues to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in December 2002 that overall public service staffing levels be reduced by 5,000 in the period 2003 to 2005. In July, 2003, the Government requested that all Departments and public bodies contribute to the overall reduction in staff numbers. My Department and the agencies under its remit are meeting their commitments in this regard.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to adoptive benefit is contingent in the first instance on entitlement to adoptive leave. The right to adoptive leave is established under the adoptive leave legislation, which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That legislation requires that the adopting parent&rsquo;s employer certifies entitlement to adoptive leave. Eligibility for adoptive benefit is confined to an adopting parent, as defined under social welfare legislation, which is in turn tied into the provisions of adoptive leave legislation. An adopting parent is an employed adopting mother, an employed sole male adopter, or, where an adopting mother has died, an employed adopting father.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, periods of adoptive leave attract a payment from my Department, subject to certain contribution conditions. He or she must have paid a minimum number of contributions at the relevant contribution classes. Foster parents are not excluded from entitlement to adoptive leave and in turn adoptive benefit but the eligibility <Col N="1993"/>criteria prescribed in both pieces of legislation must be fulfilled to establish their entitlement to adoptive benefit.</P>
    <P>The adoptive benefit scheme has been significantly improved in the last four years in terms of both the duration of the payment and the level at which it is paid. In 2001, in line with a commensurate increase in maternity leave and benefit, the duration of adoptive leave and benefit was increased by four weeks to a total of 14 weeks. Last year, it was further extended by two weeks to a total of 16 weeks. Just as significantly, the period of unpaid adoptive leave was increased by four weeks to eight weeks, bringing the total period of adoptive leave to which a woman is entitled to 24 weeks. Over the same period, the estimated cost of the adoptive benefit scheme rose from &euro;260,000 to &euro;609,000 per annum. These improvements reflect the ongoing enhancements in adoptive leave provisions.</P>

	<P>A fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week is payable to eligible households during a 29 week winter heating period from end-September to mid-April each year. An additional &euro;3.90 per week is payable in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones. Approximately 274,000 households receive a fuel allowance, and some 123,000 of these also receive a smokeless fuel supplement. The scheme is expected to cost &euro;85.4 million this year. Expenditure and numbers qualifying for the fuel allowance scheme from 1997 to 2005 are set out in the following table.</P>
    <P>In addition to fuel allowance, over 300,000 pensioners and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable toward their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of &euro;108.8 million in 2005. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people who have special heating needs.

	<P>The PRSI-free allowance for employees paying the ordinary rate of PRSI was first introduced in 1995. For that year, a weekly non-cumulative threshold of &pound;50, &euro;63.49, per week applied to employees covered under classes A, E and H and with weekly pay exceeding &pound;178, <Col N="1995"/>&euro;226.03.

    <P>In 1997, the PRSI-free allowance for employees in classes A, E and H and with weekly reckonable earnings above &pound;197, &euro;250.15, was &pound;80, &euro;101.58, per week and &pound;20, &euro;25.39, per week for employees in classes B, C, D and S.

    <P>In this regard my Department, the Family Support Agency, the Pensions Board, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and Comhairle have not re-employed any former staff on a contract basis to carry out work for which the Department or the agencies are routinely responsible. The Combat Poverty Agency does from time to time employ former staff members to carry out special short term projects but does not replace staff <Col N="1997"/>owing to the Government&rsquo;s public service numbers policy.</P>

	<P>The Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Act 2005 is a precautionary measure that allows the Government, in exceptional circumstances, to make an Order declaring that a state of difficulty exists in aviation insurance such that essential insurance is not generally available. This is not a decision that the Government will make lightly. It will be necessary to take into account the overall international situation including possible developments at EU level or at the level of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</P>
    <P>If the Government makes such an Order the Act will allow the Minister to issue indemnities to the Irish aviation industry if they are unable to obtain essential insurance in the commercial market. My Department has not received any request for an indemnity under the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Act 2005. Until a request is made the question of eligibility does not arise.</P>

    <P>Responsibility for implementing the standard of driving instruction and establishing a register of driving instructors will be with the proposed Road Safety Authority. I am considering what arrangements will be put in place to oversee implementation of the standard in the context of the establishment of the authority.

	<P><?oasys _ic14- ?>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 150 on 19 October 2005. The North-South work programme which was agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North. However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain. For that reason, it was agreed early in 2003 that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P><Col N="1999"/>
    <P>The development of a system of mutual recognition of penalty points presents complex legal questions and will require the negotiation of a bilateral agreement between the two Governments and probably the passage of primary legislation to support such an agreement. For that reason, my Department has sought and obtained the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in regard to this issue which will inform future consideration of the issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that there are proposed changes at Weston Aerodrome which have the potential to affect military airspace. My Department has not discussed this with the Department of Defence as it is not a matter for which the Department of Transport has responsibility. This issue, and many other aspects of this proposal concerning the interface between military air traffic, traffic from Weston and other civil users of the airspace, will be considered in discussions between the principal interested parties, that is, the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, Weston airport management and representatives of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. Neither has my <Col N="2000"/>Department had any discussions with the IAA on any changes at Weston as these are not matters for which the Department of Transport has responsibility.</P>
    <P>Weston Aerodrome is a privately owned aerodrome which has been operating since 1938. It is licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority in accordance with the Aerodrome and Visual Ground Aids Order, SI No. 334 of 2000, and in issuing the licence the authority&rsquo;s remit extends to aviation safety standards. The IAA licenses Weston having regard to the standards laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in annex 14 to the Chicago Convention. The IAA applies international standards to the regulation of aviation safety, including matters such as airspace design and rules of the air.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are responsible for land use planning at and in the vicinity of Weston aerodrome in accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000. In addition, the Irish Aviation Authority is a notice party under the planning and development regulations, SI No. 600 of 2001, so that any development with the potential to endanger or interfere with the safety, or safe and efficient navigation of aircraft is sent to the Irish Aviation Authority. I understand that the authority is quite satisfied with the safety levels at Weston Aerodrome.</P>

    <P>However, a further &euro;1.7 million will be allocated to Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath in 2006 to operate the 20 additional buses for which I gave approval recently and which are due to be delivered before the end of this year. I am also awaiting proposals from Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath for additional buses over and above the 20 already committed. Such proposals will also raise a requirement for additional subvention which I will consider at the appropriate time.</P>

The preferred alignment is also an integral part of the DTO&rsquo;s strategy, A Platform for Change, and is supported by the Dublin regional planning guidelines.</P>

	<P>In June 2003 a notice requesting the submission of tenders to supply a plastic card licence was published in the EU <i>Official Journal</i>. A number of developments took place following receipt of tenders and the proposals were reviewed in the light of these developments. These developments included the publication of a draft EU directive on driving licences in October 2003 proposing the issuing of new licences in plastic card format only and allowing the introduction of an optional microchip on the driving licence. There have also been developments concerning anti-fraud protection measures and possible developments in e-Government.</P>
    <P>Having considered these matters it was decided not to proceed with the tender invitation of 16 June 2003. Preparation of a revised request for tender, to take account of these developments is underway in my Department. There has been no specific expenditure to date on the project itself. Estimates and target completion dates will be agreed based on the results of the tendering process. I expect significant progress to be made in 2006.</P>

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The main purpose of the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005 is to give effect to the International Convention relating to Co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation signed at Brussels on 13 December 1960, as consolidated by the protocol signed at Brussels on 27 June 1997. The revised Eurocontrol convention was concluded following several years in negotiation. The changes represent a major revision of the convention and are designed to update the convention to take into account progress made in the area of air navigation services.</P>
    <P>Articles 5 to 9 of annex IV to the revised Eurocontrol convention refers to the issues of attaching the en-route charge as a lien on the aircraft and making the operator and owner jointly and severally liable. Ireland is under no compulsion to legislate for creation of liens or joint and several liability as to operator and owner of the aircraft and has not made provision for this in the published Bill. By not so introducing the creation of a lien and joint and several liability, Ireland cannot be said not to be discharging its obligations under the new Eurocontrol convention, as it is matter of choice for a contracting party to <Col N="2007"/>introduce domestic law to this effect. The passage of this Bill in its current form would not impact on our current powers relating to detention and sale of aircraft for unpaid charges, which have been in place since 1988.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received, however, from a number of aircraft leasing companies regarding the powers of detention and sale contained in earlier legislation, specifically the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998. Their concerns stem from the situation that aircraft leasing companies can be made liable to pay substantial charges incurred by airlines and which allow for the aircraft, engines and equipment they own or finance to be seized and sold to clear those debts in disregard of their ownership or secured lender position. This is the fundamental issue of concern to aircraft lessors and they have asked that it be rectified in the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005.</P>
    <P>My Department has had a number of discussions with aircraft leasing companies and these discussions are ongoing. Following advice received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, discussions have also taken place with the Irish Aviation Authority, the Dublin Airport Authority and Eurocontrol. Further discussions with interested parties will take place over the coming weeks following which a decision will be taken on the need for amendments to the Bill prior to its consideration in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides for the construction of a new metro line between St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and Swords and serving Dublin Airport. This line will provide a quick and efficient service to Dublin Airport from the city centre. Journey time from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will be approximately 17 minutes and trains will run every four minutes. Metro north will link up with the metro west line at Ballymun, and with Luas, DART and suburban rail services in the city centre. This will provide direct rail access to the airport from the wider rail network in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Road access to Dublin Airport, which has improved substantially in recent years as a result of the ongoing development of national roads in the greater Dublin area, will be further enhanced as a result of the M50 upgrade provided for in Transport 21.</P>

	<P>Under EU rules, the development of new air services is entirely a matter for commercial decision on the part of airlines, in consultation with the relevant airport authorities. Member states are allowed to provide financial compensation for the operation of public service obligation air services to regional airports, where it would not be economically viable for airlines to operate on a commercial basis. Earlier this year, I announced the award of contracts for the provision of PSO services on six regional routes for the next three years.</P>
    <P>Aer Arann was awarded contracts to continue operating scheduled services on routes linking Dublin with the regional airports in Galway, Kerry, Sligo and Donegal. The Scottish regional carrier, Loganair, was awarded the contract for the operation of routes linking Dublin with Knock and City of Derry Airports. Under the new PSO contracts, Aer Arann will provide three daily return services on the Galway and Kerry routes and two daily return services on the Sligo and Donegal routes. Loganair will provide two daily return services on the Derry route and one return service each day on the Knock route. The total maximum contracted subvention for the three-year contract term on all routes will be &euro;45.8 million. It remains open to the appointed air carriers to provide additional non-PSO services on the routes in question.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 2 of today. EU law permits member states to have national weight and dimension limits for road vehicles provided they do not conflict with European law. The recent judgment of the European Court of Justice, to which the Deputy refers, related to the prohibition by the Austrian authorities on the use of certain motor vehicles over 7.5 tonnes in weight on a section of motorway in the Tyrol region. This limit was lower than the weight limit specified in the relevant EU directive on vehicle weights and dimensions. The issue I am dealing with relates to the reintroduction of a <Col N="2010"/>statutory maximum height for vehicles in excess of a limit of 4 m, which is the current threshold at or below which the free circulation of vehicles within the European Union must be permitted by member states. If it is decided to reintroduce a statutory height restriction for vehicles, it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for consideration and for referral to other member states in accordance with the technical standards and regulations directive &mdash; Directive 98/34.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 envisages that a proportion of the national roads programme will be implemented by means of public private partnerships, PPPs, which will involve private sector funding, remunerated in part by user tolls. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance and will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority&rsquo;s current PPP programme comprises ten projects. There is limited capacity over and above the projects already identified to support viable tolling arrangements. Nevertheless, the cost of the national roads programme, combined with the demands of the other sectors which limit the capacity to allocate more Exchequer funding, require that all possibilities for generating additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the national roads programme be considered. The NRA considers that new tolled roads will deliver time-savings, journey time certainty, and an overall high level of service to users for the toll charge levied. Users will therefore derive identifiable benefits from their use of the tolled road, but at all times will continue to have available the existing untolled route. The provision of tolled routes will be an expansion of current route choice options.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the NRA that a strict performance regime is provided for in current PPP contracts &mdash; for example, the M1 and the M4-M6 Kilcock-Kinnegad projects &mdash; to ensure compliance with requirements, including level of service provisions. Defaults in performance by the PPP company lead to the imposition of a financial penalty together with the award of points under a penalty points system which may trigger increased levels of monitoring at the PPP company&rsquo;s cost and ultimately contract termination. These provisions incentivise the PPP company to maintain high service levels. With regard to the West Link toll bridge, the service obligations contained in this agreement, which date back to the 1980s, are not as developed or as comprehensive as those contained in current PPP contracts.</P>

    <P>No domestic or EU regulations govern the number of passengers that can be carried on an individual railway carriage. However, I expect the railway safety Bill to be enacted before year-end, and the Railway Safety Commission will then have power to make regulations in this area. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated the issue of crowding is one of discomfort and inconvenience, rather than a safety concern and this view is in line with the consensus in the railway industry worldwide. A significant increase in rail capacity has been provided in recent years in the areas referred to by the Deputy and Transport 21 identifies projects which will further enhance services on these lines. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will shortly begin the construction of a new railway station in the Dublin docklands, which will facilitate an increase in services on the Maynooth line while the Kildare route project is the subject of a railway order procedure. The company also proposes to expand its suburban rolling stock to meet the demands on all routes into Dublin.</P>

	<P>The day-to-day operation of bus services by Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann is a matter for the individual companies. However, since 10 January 2001 both Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann are required by ministerial direction to notify my <Col N="2013"/>Department of proposed new services or proposed changes to existing services at least four weeks prior to their introduction. My Department has not received any notification from Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath or Bus &Eacute;ireann for shuttle bus services to the rail stations mentioned. However, such notification would be looked at favourably by my Department, subject to compliance with the necessary regulatory requirements and with the provisions of section 25 of the Transport Act 1958, concerning competition with licensed private operators.</P>

     <Quest>the number of daily commuters using the rail stations at Kilcock, Maynooth, Leixlip, Confey, Monasterevin, Kildare, Newbridge, Sallins and Hazelhatch; the extent to which this can be increased with immediate effect with a view to meeting modern commuter requirements arising from population increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the number of commuters using rail services through these stations is 5,000 each morning. This has increased considerably over recent years, as rail services have been improved and population has increased. The company has also informed me that it proposes to introduce additional services on the introduction of their new timetable in December. These will provide the opportunity for more than 2,000 additional commuters to use its services daily on the Maynooth line. Enhancements will also be introduced to Kildare line services at that time further increasing capacity along that line. Plans under Transport 21 provide for major upgrades of service along these two lines, increasing service frequency and capacity to DART-like standards. Detailed delivery plans including timescales are currently being prepared by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and it is anticipated that there will be another significant increase in capacity in 2007 on the delivery of more units of rolling stock.</P>

	<P>Provision has been made in the Revised Estimates Volumes, published since the establishment of my Department for annual payments to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Under these provisions, my Department has paid the society &euro;1.27 million annually in 2002, 2003 and 2004. A further payment for 2005 is being prepared. Prior to the establishment of my Department an annual amount was paid to the society by the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The funding is expended in accordance with needs as assessed by the society in the light of requests for support received. Annual reports and audited accounts are received each year from the organisation, which acknowledge receipt of funds from this Department. As in the case of all voted moneys, funding provided to the society is subject to routine audit by my Department&rsquo;s internal audit unit. The internal audit unit has an internal audit strategy in place and undertakes its work on a risk analysis basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has paid the society &euro;127,000 in respect of a conference research support and development project subject to the submission of satisfactory progress reports and expenditure breakdown. Individual conferences of the society received &euro;540,000 under the scheme of community support for older people in respect of 2002, 2003, and 2004 and &euro;22,700 under programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations over the same period. My Department requires <Col N="2015"/>that groups awarded funding in respect of the scheme of community support for older people and for the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations provide receipts to the total value of the grant awarded and a statement signed by the chairperson and treasurer to the effect that the grant was used for the purpose it was awarded.</P>

    <P>Following computer validation, it was found that eight of the animals on the second application were non-CMMS compliant, meaning they were not recorded as being in the herd of the person named on the date of receipt of the application by the Department, a regulatory requirement of the scheme. The ninth animal was found to have died prior to application. Under the governing regulations, the eight non-CMMS compliant animals were liable to be rejected, that is, not paid premium, and a reduction penalty applied to other premia payments to the person named. The ninth animal was not eligible for payment and was deleted as an innocent error.</P>
    <P>Correspondence with the person named having failed to resolve the matter, an official of my Department has been in direct contact with the person named, following which the position regarding the non-compliance has been satisfactorily resolved. This application is now being further processed with a view to payment of the eight eligible animals at an early date.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the spouse of an Irish citizen who was Irish other that by naturalisation, honorary citizenship or by virtue of an earlier marriage to an Irish citizen is entitled to make a declaration of Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship following three years of marriage. In the case of the person concerned, it was open to him to exercise such an entitlement at any time between July 1986, when the provision was extended to include men, and the time of his wife&rsquo;s death. Unfortunately, that option is no longer open to him.</P>
    <P>The only other option open to the person concerned to obtain Irish citizenship is naturalisation. Section 15 of the Act provides that an applicant for naturalisation must: be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. Section 16A of the Act provides that no period of residence shall be reckoned in respect of which an applicant does not have permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State or where such permission is for the purposes of study or to seek recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalis<Col N="2019"/>ation; have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Act provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is empowered to waive some or all of the statutory requirements, including the residency requirements, where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations. In the particular circumstances outlined by the Deputy, I will certainly give consideration to utilising my discretionary powers, including waiving part of the residency requirement, in respect of any application submitted by the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Further information and the necessary application forms may be obtained from my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.justice.ie </i>or by telephoning the citizenship section helpline on Tuesdays or Thursdays between 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. at lo-call 1890 551 500 or 01 6167700. Should the individual referred to wish to enter the State in advance of obtaining Irish citizenship, he will, as a US citizen, be subject to the normal immigration controls prevailing at the time of his entry into the State.</P>

The applications will be examined and considered by a visa officer in my Department, Applications are currently taking between three to four weeks on average to process and the applicant will be notified of the decision at that time. The applications in question are for a single journey visa and not for residency as implied in the parliamentary question.</P>

	<P>The Garda SMI report makes recommendations on the reorganisation of Garda regions, divisions and districts throughout the country. However, the position has changed significantly since the consideration of these issues under the strategic management initiative, in that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which enables the most fundamental modernisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State, provides that the Commissioner will have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform. It would be premature to anticipate at this stage what proposals, if any, might be developed by the Commissioner in this context. I have sought further information from the Garda Commissioner, particularly regarding garda&iacute; in County Louth, and I will contact the Deputy again when the information is to hand.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The information provided in the parliamentary question of 9 November 2005 refers to breath tests taken at Garda stations using an intoxilyser. These tests are taken after an arrest for drink-related driving has been made. The decision as to whether a breath test using an intoxilyser or whether a blood or urine sample is required is a matter of discretion for the arresting Garda. This is established under section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of a constitutional challenge to the Road Traffic Act 1994 in 2004, where it was asserted the legislation underpinning evidential breath testing was unconstitutional. The High Court ruled that the system does not infringe constitutional rights. To date all challenges to the legislation underpinning evidential breath testing heard in the High Court and Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the overall arrest rate for drink driving is continuing to rise. In the period 1 January to 18 November 2005, there have been 11,110 recorded incidents of driving while intoxicated, including intoxicated while in charge of a vehicle, an increase of 15% over the same period last year.</P>

	<P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P>
    <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have contacted both Kildare County Council and Kildare VEC and they have no record of receiving an application from the candidate in question. The candidate should therefore apply to his or her relevant awarding body in the first instance. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the <Col N="2039"/>rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Apart from the funding provided through the student support maintenance grant schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department through the student assistance fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available from the student access officer at the college being attended.</P>

This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I can also confirm that there have been no cutbacks in the allocation of special needs assistants, SNAs, to schools and any SNA posts that have been terminated have been terminated as a result of the pupils for whom such support was originally granted no longer requiring such support. In fact the number of SNAs in our schools increased significantly in 2005 and there are now over 6,000 SNAs in the primary school system compared to some 300 in 1998.</P>

The Department has no record of any report on the matter from the person concerned nor does it <Col N="2041"/>have any record of a meeting with the then Minister for Justice on the matter. The correspondence was not provided to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse as it was not deemed by legal counsel to be directly relevant to the inquiry and did not come within the scope of commission discovery orders.</P>

	<P>Records indicate that my Department was first advised in 1991 by the principal of the school referred to by the Deputy of this complaint and the investigation involving the school and the health board into it. This investigation concluded that the allegations were unfounded. Following the subsequent referral of the matter to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse by the complainant, my Department commissioned an independent assessment of the initial investigation. This assessment concluded that the initial investigation was seriously flawed and that its outcome was not satisfactory. In 1994, following fresh allegations of abuse of children at the school, a Garda investigation was carried out. At the conclusion of this investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there was no evidence to support these allegations.</P>
    <P>As part of an overall investigation into allegations of abuse at the school the Garda, in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board, my Department and the management of the school initiated a look-back investigation in 1996. This involved interviews with a sample of former residents and identified a number of allegations of abuse. Arising from this investigation, files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions regarding allegations of abuse at the industrial school. My Department provided every possible assistance to the Garda and made available all relevant records in this regard.</P>

	<P>Section 7 of the Education Act 1998 confers a function on the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that appropriate education and support services are provided to children, including children with special educational needs. The State delivers therapies through the Health Services Executive, HSE, which is funded by the Oireachtas to provide such services. This is made clear by sections 7(5) and (6) of the Education Act 1998, as amended by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and Health Act 2004.</P>
    <P>These provisions state that, following consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Education and Science can call on the HSE to assist her in providing, planning and co-ordinating support services, and the HSE is obliged to comply with this request. These provisions took effect on 14 July 2005. Section 9 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 will also have a relevance in this context, when it is commenced. It provides that where a child who has an education plan is to be transferred from one school to another, there must be consultation between the schools before the transfer takes place. This is intended to ensure that the second school knows the content of the education plan and is assisted in amending the plan, where this is necessary, having regard to the special educational needs of the child and the operation of that school.</P>
    <P>Where an amendment to the education plan is proposed in these circumstances, the principal of <Col N="2043"/>the new school will consult with the relevant special educational needs organiser if requested to do so by the parents. If necessary, the needs organiser can reconvene the education plan team for the purpose of reviewing the content and implementation of the plan and may, as a consequence of that review, amend the plan.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 253 together.</P>
    <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 was enacted in July 2004. Sections 1, 2, 14(1)(<i>a</i>), 14(1)(<i>c</i>), 14(2) to 14(4), inclusive, 19 to 37, inclusive, 40 to 44, inclusive, and 50 to 53, inclusive, of the Act were commenced on 14 July 2005. Separate establishment day orders were made in respect of the National Council for Special Education and the special education appeals board, setting their establishment dates as 1 October 2005 and 3 April 2006, respectively. A further commencement order was signed to commence sections 45 to 49 with effect from 1 October 2005, abolishing the council established under section 54 of the Education Act 1998 and replacing it with the council established under the 2004 Act. Those sections could not come into effect prior to the establishment of the new council under section 19 of the 2004 Act.</P>

They cannot come into effect without the council having an opportunity to present an implementation report to the Minister, which it must do before 1 October 2006. The National Council for Special Education published a call for submissions on the implementation of the Act in the national media on 21 October 2005. The closing date for submissions is 13 January 2006. If the Deputy wishes to advise any interested groups on the suggested format in which submissions can be made, information in that regard is available from the council.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment. The nationality requirement, which is set out in clause 4.5 of the 2005 higher education grant scheme guidelines, provides that candidates must hold EU nationality; have official refugee status; have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State; have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of <Col N="2045"/>another EU member state who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed or self-employed in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland. Officials from the Department of Education and Science have received an appeal from the candidate who was turned down by Kildare County Council, which is the awarding body in this case. As the candidate referred to by the Deputy is a non-EU national who has been granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child, I regret that she does not comply with the above conditions and is ineligible for grant assistance under the nationality requirements of the scheme. There are no plans to extend the nationality clause of the student support schemes. Any extension to the scope of the maintenance grants scheme can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>

The council is charged with conducting and commissioning research on matters relevant to its functions and, as it considers appropriate, publishing in such form and manner as it thinks fit the findings of such research; advising the Minister for Education and Science on any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities, if it is requested by the Minister to do so; making available to the parents of children with disabilities information about their children&rsquo;s educational provision; consulting with schools, health boards and other relevant bodies about the provision of education and support services to children with disabilities; carrying out from time to time general assessments and reviews of the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities; monitoring the educational progress of children with disabilities and ensuring it is reviewed at regular intervals; and disseminating to schools and parents information <Col N="2046"/>about best practice, nationally and internationally, in the education of children with disabilities. In carrying out its functions, the council and its employees are required to act in accordance with any policy direction issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The functions of the National Council for Special Education, as set out in section 20 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, are to disseminate to schools, parents and such other persons as it considers appropriate information on best practice, nationally and internationally, concerning the education of children with special educational needs; to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with schools, the HSE and such other persons it considers appropriate; to plan for the integration of education for students with special educational needs with education for students generally, in consultation with schools and with such persons as the council considers appropriate; to make available to the parents of children with special educational needs information about their entitlements and the entitlements of their children; to ensure that the progress of students with special educational needs is monitored and reviewed at regular intervals; to assess and review the resources required in respect of educational provision for children with special educational needs; to ensure that a continuum of special educational provision is available as required in respect of each type of disability; to review generally the provision made for adults with disabilities to avail of higher education and adult and continuing education, rehabilitation and training and to publish reports on the results of such reviews, which may include recommendations on the manner in which such provision could be improved; to advise all educational institutions on best practice regarding the education of adults who have disabilities; to advise the Minister on any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities; to consult with such voluntary bodies as the council considers appropriate, as long as the objectives of such bodies relate to the promotion of the interests of or the provision of support services to persons with disabilities, for the purposes of ensuring that their knowledge and expertise can inform the council&rsquo;s development of policy and planning and provision of support services, and to conduct and commission research on matters relevant to the functions of the council and, as it considers appropriate, to publish in such form and manner as the council thinks fit the findings arising out of such research.</P>
    <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 also confers functions on the council relating to a new statutory assessment and education plan process.

Such amendments are normally published monthly in arrears. The military authorities have informed me that the publication of a special <i>Gazette</i> amendment, which will include all Reserve Defence Force officer appointments encompassing 671 officers, will occur in the near future. The magnitude and complexity of the restructuring of the Reserve Defence Force and the large number of officers involved has lead to the slight delay in publication of the <i>Gazette</i> amendment.

	<P>The Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan was formally launched by my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, in July 2004. The plan, which was formulated following extensive consultation, received broad support, particularly from the representative association of the Reserve Defence Force. The plan, which will be implemented between now and the end of 2009, will significantly enhance the capability of the Reserve Defence Force. The recent reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force, which represents a critical milestone in the implementation plan, involved root and branch changes in the Reserve Defence Force. It necessitated the disestablishment of the FCA and Slua Muir&iacute; and the establishment of a dedicated Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve. The reorganisation, which involved restructuring the Reserve Defence Force along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force, necessarily involved unit amalgamations. The military authorities issued comprehensive procedures to provide for the assignment of all reservists, including officers, to units of the Reserve Defence Force. I am aware that any significant organisational change, such as that in the Reserve Defence Force, can lead to concern and uncertainty. Such concerns and uncertainty were evident when the Permanent Defence Force was recently reorganised. There is a broad consensus that the changes brought significant improvements to the Permanent Defence Force, however. I am confident that the plan for the Reserve Defence Force will do likewise.</P>

	<P>I propose to <Col N="2051"/>take Questions Nos. 262, 267, 270 and 271 together.</P>
    <P>A working group of the Law Reform Commission is examining a range of legal issues relating to the management of multi-unit structures. The Government will consider the recommendations of the final report, including the necessity, if any, for new legislation in this area. Management companies operate in the majority of apartment developments, in some other higher density developments, often with a mix of designs, and in a very small number of standard housing developments. The role of management companies is to maintain the common property, including buildings, sewers, water pipes, public lighting, roads and footpaths contained within the boundaries of the overall property. When housing developments are taken in charge, it is the responsibility of the local authority to maintain public infrastructure such as roads, footpaths, sewers, water mains and public lighting. The existence of a management company should not override the legal obligation on developers to complete estates and, where required by the planning permission, to maintain estates until they are taken in charge.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a number of provisions designed to ensure that housing estates are finished as soon as possible, maintained to a satisfactory standard for the benefit of those living in them and taken in charge by local authorities. The section recognises the common practice of establishing management companies, control of which is transferred to the owners of the housing units, to maintain or manage residential developments. Individual planning authorities must make their own judgments, based on local circumstances and policies, about how and to what extent they should use the new framework planning legislation provisions in particular cases. The Department has asked planning authorities for a report on their policies on the attachment of conditions relating to management companies to planning permissions for various types of residential developments.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Ballygar water supply scheme was eighth on the list of water schemes submitted by Galway County Council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to all local authorities in 2003 to undertake assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2004-2006, published in May 2004. Given the ratings afforded to the scheme by the council, it was not possible to include it in the current programme. I envisage that local authorities will be afforded an opportunity in 2006 to undertake fresh assessments of their needs and priorities, which can then be taken into account in subsequent phases of the programme.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Enforcement in relation to illegal diesel laundering activities is <Col N="2053"/>primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. However, over the last two years my Department has provided funding of &euro;823,930 to Louth County Council on an exceptional basis in recognition of the particular difficulties which arose for that authority in responding to instances of illegal dumping of oil-laundering residues, particularly in relation to costs incurred by them in arranging for the safe disposal abroad of the hazardous materials involved.</P>
    <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>I recognise that a complete solution to this problem is difficult to arrive at and must necessarily involve more effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department has recently met with representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions, and these contacts will continue. I am also aware of enhanced co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies, through the enforcement network which has been established by the Office of Environmental Enforcement.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 205 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 strengthened the powers of planning authorities to issue tree preservation orders, which in their opinion are required in the interests of amenity or the environment. These orders, <i>inter alia</i>, can place a prohibition on the cutting down or removal of trees or can require the owner or occupier of land to work with the planning authority to ensure the proper management of specific trees.</P>
    <P>It is also open to planning authorities to protect trees through the planning control system when dealing with applications for development in sites containing trees. Having regard to this extensive range of powers, there are no proposals to amend the legislation in this regard.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have specific information on the proposal referred to. My Department provides funding under the housing management initiatives grant scheme to fund innovative and practical pilot projects designed to improve housing management performance by local authorities and other bodies with housing management functions. A number of projects in County Louth were approved earlier this year. These include the appointment of a tenant liaison officer and an investigations officer to carry out work in Dundalk and Drogheda as well as in the county area. I also approved a project submitted by Dundalk Town Council to formalise housing management activity in respect of a number of housing groups in the Toberona area.</P>
    <P>Dundalk Town Council is undertaking regeneration projects to two large local authority estates in the town. Consultants have been appointed for the project at Cox&rsquo;s Demesne while consultants are due to be appointed shortly for the Muirheavnamore estate. A steering group has been established to oversee the development of the proposals for the regeneration.</P>
    <P>My Department recently agreed to a contribution of &euro;300,000 towards the provision of child care facilities at Muirheavnamore. Planning permission is currently being sought for the facility with construction expected to commence before the end of the year.</P>
