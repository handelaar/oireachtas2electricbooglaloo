    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieHealyRae"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter, namely the need for further funding for Tralee General Hospital, the shortage of financial resources, under-staffing and the lack of medical care for patients in cardiac units, oncology and accident and emergency leading to patients spending long hours on trolleys and resulting in the unprecedented protest by 40 Kerry general practitioners on the grounds of Kerry General Hospital on Monday, 14 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not have happened a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent importance, namely, the need for the Government to deliver designated transport for cancer patients attending centres in Cork and Dublin for radiotherapy treatments. Critically ill patients are under severe financial pressure trying to find their own transport, with local charities being forced to help out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of major national importance, namely, the dire predictions for the BMW area for 2025 in the NUI Maynooth report on rural Ireland, showing a decimation of full-time farmers from 40,000 to 10,000 and those to be located in the south and east; the continuing bias favouring development in the south and east due to Government policy; and considering the underspend identified in the mid-term review of the national development plan for the BMW area, the need for the Estimates to make up the BMW under-spend in <Col N="858"/>the capital envelope to address the regional imbalance in infrastructural investment and give the BMW area and rural Ireland a future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent importance, namely, to allow the Minister for Defence explain why he allowed himself to be photographed pointing a gun at a cameraman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>He should be arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent should get a life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and to hear the Government policy on how it can reconcile this promotion of a gun culture with the horrific shootings and escalating levels of violent crime occurring on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Keep taking the tablets, Trevor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to have the business of the House suspended under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent public importance, namely, the use of white phosphorous weapons against civilians in Fallujah last year and the fact that this was denied by the Pentagon; and in the light of this deception, the need now for the Irish Government to authorise searches of planes in Shannon which the Bush Administration claims are not carrying terrorist suspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 4, Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to adjourn at 2 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 1, Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill 2005 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to put to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I object, Sir, to No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You cannot object to the Order of Business, Deputy, as there are no proposals before the House. It is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s prerogative to decide on the business of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an inappropriate Bill. Every minor fine in it is a criminal offence which means that anybody so caught cannot travel to the United States, for instance. There was no consultation with the fishing industry about this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="859"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot have a debate now. You will have an opportunity to speak on the Bill shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When is it proposed to publish the report into the Abbeylara shooting? It has been promised on a number of occasions, including in June and September. I have been informed by a number of suppliers to the health service, mostly small suppliers, that the former health boards have cash flow difficulties with regard to paying manufacturers and service suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Do you have a question on legislation, Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste propose to introduce a Supplementary Estimate this year to deal with current cash flow difficulties in paying suppliers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Abbeylara report has not been received yet. If a Supplementary Estimate is introduced, it will not be to deal with the matter raised by the Deputy. The mental health commission, for example, was not established this year because of a dispute with the consultants. There is some additional money that may be allocated to other needs in the health area between now and the end of the year but I am not aware of any issue regarding the payment of suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I bring the matter to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are not permitted to oppose No. 4, we are entitled to ask the T&aacute;naiste, given the dispute between the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, whether the Government will proceed with this Bill. When will No. 66 on the legislative programme, the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, be published? Will it provide for the protection of witnesses on a statutory basis?</P>
      <P>Rather than making a matter of frivolity at a time when two warring gangs are feuding and risking public safety on the streets of this city, does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that the photograph on the front page of today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> is, at minimum, an ill-judged tasteless stunt by a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy finds another way of raising this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;mad on publicity and completely without regard for the environment in which he permits this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="860"/>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte should take the matter up with the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should have considered his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The editor should know the Minister is a clown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the gun loaded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We were lucky it was not loaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should be allowed to respond without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will proceed with the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. It is important legislation and will be debated next week. We hope to have it passed as quickly as possible. The criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be brought forward next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he now be known as Willie the Kid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the worst joke I have heard this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we to expect any ministerial accountability for a photograph showing the Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am merely asking the question. The answer is obviously &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Durkan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan has been called. I will return to Deputy Sargent if he has an appropriate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to promised legislation. I have raised the matter under Standing Order 31 and am entitled to find out whether the Government has a view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not entitled to raise it. I have dealt with this matter under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent should raise the matter with <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="861"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has a view on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have called Deputy Durkan. I will call Deputy Sargent again presently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Defence can defend himself. He does not need the Ceann Comhairle to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking a basic question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to obey Standing Orders and the ruling of the Chair. If he does not want to do that, he is aware of the appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I obey Standing Orders and I accept the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling on Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent was shot down by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, I tabled a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, requesting information on funding for the next phase of the Naas General Hospital development programme. The reply I received was that my query had been referred to the Health Service Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation may be required because we cannot get answers to the parliamentary questions we put to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No legislation is promised in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, will the chief executive of the HSE come into the House to answer questions? The Minister provides the funding and my question was about funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must find another way of raising this matter. It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but the T&aacute;naiste wishes to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Costello. Deputy Durkan is generally very orderly.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="862"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless the T&aacute;naiste has handed over responsibility for funding to somebody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, will answer my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers indicate that the Minister for Defence, following talks with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General in the aftermath of the remarks made by Anjum Choudhury in Trinity College last week, intends to seek an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the question. The Minister for Defence claims he will seek an amendment to the incitement to hatred legislation. When is this amendment expected?</P>
      <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that the photograph in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> of the same Minister pointing a gun&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;might be described as provocative? It might be the first case to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the first shot in the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends, by way of a statutory instrument, to amend the legislation on incitement to hatred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the second matter I raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, should be disarmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We will set Paul Williams on the Opposition Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste give some indication when these regulations will be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand it will be within the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the urgent need to discuss the ever-rising cost of medicines, the practices of the pharmaceutical industry and the need to encourage increased availability of generic medicines, will the two pharmacy Bills be <Col N="863"/>taken together and is there any prospect they will be expedited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Bills deal with the regulation of the pharmacy profession. The first Bill, which deals with some fitness to practice issues, will be brought forward early next year. The cost of pharmaceuticals, which accounts for 11% of the health budget, is not the subject of legislation but rather of negotiation. Such negotiation will take place shortly both with the industry and other elements of the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmacists and wholesalers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste indicated that her Department may bring forward a Supplementary Estimate this year. What other Departments will present the same? Will today&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006 include all the Supplementary Estimates in the outturn provided for 2005 so that we have a proper picture of the overall spending position for this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to my Department, I am considering the allocation of some unspent moneys to priority areas. I have mentioned the moneys allocated for the mental health tribunals which have not been spent and will not be spent this year. I am not in a position to say whether other Ministers may plan to bring forward Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the outturn figures be accurate? Will they reflect those anticipated provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The outturn figures will, but I understand today&rsquo;s Estimates for public services will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure any money saved in the mental health area is spent in that area which is starved of funds? This morning, her Department and the HSE made a presentation on combatting MRSA. It is clear they are losing the battle and that guidelines and good intentions are not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste consider making MRSA a disease notifiable to the HSE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy submits a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is in the Chamber and I know she is concerned about MRSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is not appropriate. Questions on health cannot be addressed <Col N="864"/>simply because the T&aacute;naiste is taking the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will she consider changes to legislation? We must stop the foostering around which is not delivering results and has facilitated an increase rather then decrease in MRSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot answer questions because the law does not allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is little evidence of democracy in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There does not seem to be any regulation in regard to plastic surgery. Will the medical practitioners (miscellaneous provisions) Bill cover this area? When is the earliest date of publication for that legislation? As we are dealing with real doctors, will the position for the Government&rsquo;s chief science adviser be advertised this time around?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The latter issue does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It arises on every other business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have a licensing regime for hospitals but the medical practitioners (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will make the registration of professionals mandatory in future. We must look in due course at the licensing of hospital facilities and other places where medical treatments take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of events in Kashmir in the last several weeks and the constant reminders from Charlie Bird and other reporters of these events, will the Government redouble its efforts to help the people affected? The snows are due in ten days&rsquo; time there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland is the third largest <i>per capita</i> contributor in the world to the relief fund. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development and human rights and others will be available to do whatever else we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was confirmation this morning that a large chunk, namely the marine part, of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be transferred to another Department. The ongoing feud between the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has been resolved by taking out Deputy Gallagher&rsquo;s area. <Col N="865"/>Given the promise in the programme for Government, is it possible to have a debate on a future department for maritime matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a debate promised?</P>

    <Title>Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005: Order for Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Bill entitled an Act to revise with amendments Part xiii of The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 and The Maritime Jurisdiction Acts 1959 to 1988, to amend and extend the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2003, the Mercantile Marine Act 1955, the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968, the <Col N="868"/>Dumping at Sea Act 1996 and the Maritime Safety act 2005, to amend or repeal certain enactments and to provide for connected matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That Second Stage be taken now.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not agree to the Order for Second Stage on the basis that there was no prior consultation with the House, the relevant committee or the stakeholders. It was suddenly published and brought to a hastily arranged meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. At that meeting, all Members from the Government side strongly indicated they would oppose of the taking of this Bill as presented. For that reason, I want to take the opportunity to show to the fishing industry and the coastal communities how those Government Members will talk the talk but not walk the walk and will support the Government&rsquo;s legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is inappropriate, ill-judged and a one dimensional approach to the management of our valuable fish resources. The Bill is perceived to be about consolidating law and remedying constitutional deficiencies but has been hijacked. However, it is a totally different Bill that takes the opportunity of legislation to bring in wholly unwarranted provisions and curtailments on citizens&rsquo; rights of redress. The Bill is opposite to what is needed in this industry. It highlights how the Government is disinterested, in disarray and at loggerheads with itself as to fisheries policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party opposes the Order for Second Stage on the grounds that the Bill has been subject to consideration outside of the House. There is uncertainty about the Bill&rsquo;s nature and whether what has been presented to us is what the Government intends. It is being presented by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources whose Ministers seem to be in open warfare. Yesterday, on Question Time, there were at least six seats between the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher. Now they are sitting together so maybe they had an opportunity to talk overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>

Last June, we were requested to give the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources an opportunity to discuss it before it was published. We deferred publication from the end of June or early July to the end of September as the House did not sit and the Bill could not be taken.

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to modernise the legislative framework for sea-fisheries. The principal Act currently in place was adopted in the mid 20th century and was subject to a number of amendments. It was designed for a sea fishing industry which primarily involved short trips by small Irish boats. The sea fishing industry has changed almost beyond recognition since then in terms of the size of the fleet. It now includes many multi-million euro businesses with large Irish boats operating in far away regions and large non-Irish boats fishing in Irish waters &mdash; I should say in the waters around Ireland <Col N="872"/>because they are European waters now whether one likes it or not. These boats often land their catches in Ireland. Many Members will be familiar with the number of French vessels which land into Killybegs and Castletownbere. The industry is now substantially regulated at EU level through the Common Fisheries Policy. In addition, the Bill is designed to fill a major gap in the Fisheries Acts regarding the implementation of the EU Common Fisheries Policy following litigation which resulted in the impugning by the Supreme Court of certain secondary legislation for lack of cover in the current Acts. It is necessary to amend the legal framework to have regard to these realities and to modernise our systems and structures so that best practice in fisheries management and control is implemented.</P>
      <P>Section 14 fills the gap identified in section 224B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 by enabling detailed ministerial regulations to be made to apply the full range of EU requirements <Col N="873"/>throughout the whole area to which the EU Common Fisheries Policy applies. As section 224B currently stands, it only applies within the 200 nautical miles exclusive fishery limits of the State and only specifically prohibits illegal fishing or attempts to fish illegally.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Bill fills the gaps identified in section 223A of the 1959 Act by specifically enabling detailed ministerial regulations to be made to supplement the EU Common Fisheries Policy where the State has discretion as to the particular measures to be adopted.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of the House, the current text of sections 223A and 224B of the 1959 Act is set out in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 to the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum which was published with the Bill.</P>
      <P>In addressing the issues arising from the Supreme Court judgments referred to, it was necessary to comprehensively review the whole of Part XIII of the 1959 Act and all subsequent Acts dealing with sea fisheries. The Government decided, in the interests of proper regulation, to replace Part XIII of the 1959 Act, as amended, by the up-to-date provisions which are now in Part 2 and sections 64 to 66, inclusive, of the Bill. Thus, on enactment of the Bill, there will only be two Acts instead of seven dealing with sea fisheries, that is, this Bill and the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 reforming sea fishing boat licensing arrangements with provision for appeal. This is a major achievement by the Government since it came into Office.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to Appendix 4 to the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum published with the Bill which shows the link between the sections of Part XIII of the 1959 Act, as amended, and the relevant sections of Part 2 of the Bill which replace them.</P>
      <P>On section 18 of the Bill, the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources at its meeting in which I participated on 12 October raised the matter of the powers of protection officers to fire guns which have been on the Statute Books since 1959. We are consulting with the Department of Defence on the provision that allows a sea fishery officer, in certain circumstances, to carry firearms and to fire a gun at or into the boat. I want to make it abundantly clear that I intend to introduce a suitable amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this issue which is understandably of concern to many, including myself. I have had a discussion with the Minister for Defence this morning.</P>

	<P>We had five problems. That is one resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 28 updates and consolidates penalty provisions, dating from 1978, and updated subsequently on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, for a variety of sea fisheries offences according to the following principles. The EU Common Fisheries Policy requires a deterrent and dissuasive system of penalties, applicable to any offenders against Irish law. A person who fishes illegally should not benefit from that activity and no stakeholder &mdash; politician, processor or producer &mdash; would differ with me on that. No one should benefit from that activity in accordance with the obligations imposed on member states by the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The current Irish penalties regime, including forfeitures, is designed as a deterrent and dissuasive regime and great care needs to be exercised in introducing any fundamental change. Any change would have to be justified objectively, for clear policy grounds and would need to show that it furthered the deterrent and dissuasive requirement of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The increases in maximum fines proposed should be sufficient to provide an effective range of fines for the courts to deal with both large and small scale economic infractions and large and small boats. These are maximum fines and it will be a matter for the courts to decide on the fine to be imposed in any particular case. It is generally accepted that the penalty should fit the crime but that is a matter for the judges, not for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Blame the judges now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is setting the level of fines in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true generally.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding the matter of administrative penalties, the Bill reflects the considered view of the Government that it is critically important to have in place fines and forfeitures that are genuinely dissuasive. Section 28 sets maximum fines that may be applied for any particular offence and must take account of the scale of the offence and whether or not it is a repeat. This also is a matter for the courts. As I stated, the court will determine the actual level of fine to be applied. <Col N="875"/>It is important that Ireland sends out a clear message that illegal sea fishing is serious and will be dealt with accordingly. That of course is true for all countries and that should apply throughout all member states.</P>
      <P>Appendix 3 to the explanatory and financial memorandum published with the Bill shows the current and proposed maximum fines for sea fisheries offences. In lieu of the single fine, up to a maximum of &pound;100,000 &mdash;&euro;126,974 &mdash; currently payable on conviction on indictment for an offence under section 224B of the 1959 Act, which is now section 14 of the Bill, section 28 of the Bill provides for a range of maximum fines tailored to the gravity of each offence: &euro;200,000 for the most serious contraventions involving vessel capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The average fine in Europe is &euro;4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;&euro;100,000 for contraventions involving illegal nets or other equipment, or &euro;35,000 for other contraventions such as logbook offences. In my view this represents a reasonable increase on the level which was put in place in 1994. The fine proposed for fishing without a sea fishing boat licence has been increased from the level of &euro;12,700, or &pound;10,000, set in 1983 to &euro;100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>An eight-fold increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 800%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Fishing without a licence must be regarded as a particularly serious offence and the level of fine proposed in the Bill reflects this severity.</P>
      <P>To avoid unnecessary Circuit Court proceedings, section 28 also provides, on standard lines, for summary conviction by the District Court for minor offences, subject to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000, which reflects the current limit of jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
      <P>Section 28 maintains the long-standing <i>status quo</i> from 1978 on forfeitures by providing for forfeitures of fish and fishing gear as a statutory consequence of conviction on indictment, while section 29 simply reflects the existing provision, dating from 1994, for the forfeiture of boats also, if the court so orders when the circumstances so warrant. The levels of forfeiture that apply to indictable offences have been on the Statute Book for decades and are regarded as a considerable deterrent and set a proportionate penalty.</P>
      <P>Changes in forfeitures for indictable offences would create considerable problems for defendants and the prosecution in sea fisheries cases. Most arrests involve a number of infringements<?oasys _jy?><Col N="876"/><?oasys _fc?>and charges and a system where only illegal fish or fish gear were to be forfeited could involve lengthy disputes about each count. It is the experience that the courts keep in view the value of forfeiture when fixing fines and fines are often at the lower end of the scale because the value of the catch and gear has been forfeited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fairly pathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The industry has made a strong case for the introduction of administrative penalties and sanctions. This was debated at length at the hearing at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. While the introduction of such a system would have certain advantages, particularly the potential to deal speedily with offences, I am advised there are substantial legal issues arising in the implementation of such a system. In the case of most fisheries offences, the EU Common Fisheries Policy requires that the penalties must be deterrent and dissuasive and must involve depriving the wrongdoer of the benefit of his or her actions. Mandatory forfeitures are necessary to ensure the State complies with its obligations. The fines and forfeitures, therefore, are at a substantial level and I am advised that under the Irish legal system such penalties would be applied only to acts that were criminal in nature and therefore could only be administered by the courts by virtue of Article 34 of the Constitution, which provides that &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.&rdquo; In the circumstances, a defendant is entitled to have the matter dealt with in open court with the full protections of the law and a jury trial, when faced with a potential penalty above certain limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>But he is entitled to consent to have it dealt with on an administrative basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Continental systems governed by civil law have a different approach and it must not be assumed that we could adopt the sort of system which may be in operation in much of Europe, and which is in operation in many parts of Europe. There are administrative sanctions with which we would have no great difficulty provided we could find a structure for them. Some 86% of arrests in Europe are dealt with by way of administrative sanctions for minor offences. Nobody is suggesting they should apply to any offences other than minor ones &mdash; the courts should deal with the others. I am advised, on the basis of Article 33 of the Constitution that this system creates a difficulty.</P>
      <P>In the context of the concerns expressed by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, chaired by Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, the Attorney General has reviewed the legal position. He has confirmed that under the Irish legal system and Constitution, administrative penalties are not possible in respect of these types of offences.</P>

	<P>It is a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of sea fisheries, I am advised that the State would face the problem that the required level of sanction would trespass on the exclusive role of the courts in the administration of justice, thus exposing the administrative system to legal challenge. There would be no protection arising from Article 29.4.10&deg; of the Constitution. From a legal perspective, to adopt a system of administrative penalties without being obliged to do so by EU legislation would, I am advised, render any measure vulnerable to legal challenge. This is why I say I will actively try to ensure the existence of a level playing field across the Union regarding the imposition of administrative penalties for minor sea fishery offences. These are not idle words &mdash; I will certainly pursue that objective while I am in this Department.</P>
      <P>I agree that the fines in some member states are not adequate. However, in other member states the fines imposed are higher than those in Ireland. In most member states, the number of fines is far greater than in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Which countries are those?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Low fines in some member states do not and cannot justify Ireland deciding to reduce the level of penalties. I am committed to building sustainable sea fisheries and strengthening control of these fisheries. It is necessary to support this objective with penalties that are dissuasive.</P>
      <P>Section 32 aims to capture the ill-gotten gains arising from illegal sea fishing and should serve to effectively deter such activity. The court will decide the issue in any case, with the guidance of the detailed provisions of the section. The section is a necessary addition to the current suite of statutory provisions for the imposition by the courts of fines and forfeitures and may be used even if it is not feasible to take Court proceedings for an offence of illegal fishing. Measures such as these are needed to safeguard fish stocks and <Col N="880"/>allowable catches for the law-abiding and should commend themselves widely.</P>
      <P>The updating of the legislative framework for sea fisheries is regarded by the Government as an integral part of its commitment to modernising structures and delivering sustainable sea fisheries to ensure long-term economically prosperous coastal communities. The &euro;45 million scrappage scheme for the whitefish and shellfish sections of the Irish fleet, which the Government agreed last July, demonstrates this commitment clearly. It presents an opportunity to decommission vessels over 15 years of age that are more than 18 metres in length in the whitefish sector and more than 15 metres in length in the shellfish sector. We invited those who wish to decommission vessels to do so. BIM is dealing with the applications on our behalf and as soon as I have details on the numbers, tonnage, etc., I will make them available to the House.</P>

	<P>To modernise the implementation and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy, in line with developments in other member states and the European Commission, the Bill proposes to legally separate responsibility for enforcement of fisheries policy from the policy-making functions of the Minister. This initiative will vest statutory responsibility and accountability in statutory officers within the Department. However, this is only an interim step. It is my intention to bring forward proposals early in the new year to establish a new independent executive as a regulatory body vested with the statutory responsibility for the control and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy. It is also my intention that such an agency will be set up on an administrative basis, independent of the Department, early in the new year, pending the introduction of the necessary legislation. In addition, other responsibilities may be vested in such an agency in due course. I am also giving serious consideration to including the licensing authority in this agency. I want to remove both of these functions from the Department and make them independent. Issues of perception may be involved. I will defend those who are responsible in the licensing agency and those who advise me at present as being totally independent. However, if their functions must be removed from the Department, it is not just sufficient to do this &mdash; we must be seen to do it.</P>

	<P>To avoid legal doubt and in the interests of coherence and accessibility for all concerned, it was also decided to update and consolidate the law from 1894 relating to the registration of sea fishing boats. Those provisions are in Chapter 6 of Part 4. For convenience, section 64 contains the up-to-date text of the law relating to sea fishing boat licensing, incorporating the <Col N="882"/>changes made by section 53 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005.</P>
      <P>I now turn to other provisions relating to sea fisheries matters, namely, the substantive sections 65, 66 and 67, which are designed to clarify the law and benefit the law-abiding in the light of evolving needs and circumstances. Section 65 is intended to prevent competitive distortion due to non-compliance by some sea fishing enterprises with tax obligations. The section imposes tax clearance requirements for the grant of sea fishing boat licences, because licensing provides access to a very valuable public resource. Tax clearance is a requirement for the grant of taxi licences for that reason. The section will be commenced by ministerial order as soon as necessary consultations on the matter have taken place after the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>Section 66 clarifies the scope of ministerial policy directives to the sea fishing boat licensing authority or appeals officers, so as to include a specific reference to measures to control and regulate the capacity of the sea fishing fleet and the rational management of fisheries. The detailed directives already in place have been duly presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas as the 2003 Act requires, and are readily viewable on the Department&rsquo;s website. Section 67 reduces unnecessary bureaucracy by exempting from compulsory registration as a ship under the Mercantile Marine Act 1955 any sea fishing boat of less than 15 metres in length overall which is registered in the statutory register of fishing boats or is formally exempted for such registration.</P>
      <P>Section 27 is intended to facilitate Circuit Court proceedings for indictable offences under the Fisheries Acts by restoring the pre-2001 arrangements for cases to be sent forward for trial without unnecessary District Court proceedings, and should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The House will be glad to note the continuing significant development of aquaculture within the statutory framework provided by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, as refined by the 1998 and 2001 Fisheries Acts. The period since the enactment of the 1997 Act has, overall, been one of significant growth and development for the aquaculture sector, and the value of its output in 2004 was some &euro;98 million. It is now a key component of overall seafood production and is generally recognised as having the capacity to play a critical role in the economic life of many coastal peripheral areas. The objective must be to ensure that the sector&rsquo;s further development is on a sustainable and environmentally friendly basis. The regulatory framework established by the 1997 Act is central to the achievement of this objective, and the proposed changes to that framework are designed to enhance its operational effectiveness. It is proposed that licence renewals may be granted for the continuance of well-run aquaculture operations of long standing, without the renewal in all cases having to be formally effected before the licences in question have expired.</P><Col N="883"/>
      <P>As the House will appreciate, it may not be possible in every case to have all the necessary site inspections, or water and other analyses, formally completed before a particular date. In such circumstances it would clearly be unfair to disrupt efficient, well-run operations on what would be something of a technicality. It is proposed, therefore, that a licensee who has applied for a renewal of his or her licence will be able to continue to operate, subject to the terms and conditions of the licence, until a decision is made on the renewal application. I am relaxing the current blanket provisions for terminating a licence if I am satisfied that the operations could not commence within two years, as is the current position, or have been suspended for a continuous period of two years, for bona fide reasons such as illness on the part of the licence holder, fish health or environmental conditions.</P>
      <P>This is not a charter for people to acquire licences speculatively in the hope that after some years they can assign them to a third party. On the contrary, where licensed sites are simply not being used, the licences will be revoked and made available to others who are willing and able to operate the sites more productively.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is also being taken to facilitate the reduction of licensed sites and licensed production, and the use of novel or experimental equipment, subject to appropriate conditions. The problem mainly arises in bottom culture where substantial portions of licensed sites may prove to be unsuitable for cultivation. At present licence holders wishing to reduce the size of their licensed areas and benefit from a proportional reduction in licence fees are obliged to go through the licensing process anew. I do not consider this to be necessary or appropriate and believe it should be open to a licensee to simply request the reduction of the licensed area or the permitted production.</P>
      <P>While these changes relating to aquaculture are essentially technical in nature, I hope they will effect a beneficial streamlining of the licensing process. Aquaculture production is primarily intended for human consumption and food safety considerations must therefore prevail.</P>
      <P>Section 69 is designed to safeguard Exchequer revenues by preventing the build-up of arrears of charges for services provided at the five State-owned fishery harbours and allowing the fishery harbour centres to continue to meet customer needs, which are not confined to the fisheries sector. I will deal with the question of arrears in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The essential core of the Bill is an important suite of provisions to strengthen sea fisheries law and improve enforcement arrangements to safeguard sea fish stocks for sustainable fishing and rational management. All accept that we are the custodians and must ensure that we protect the resources of not just Ireland but all of Europe. There is an obli<Col N="884"/>gation on every Member and on the European Commission to ensure that we have a sustainable fishery and preserve resources for future generations. I look forward to the contributions of other Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael in Government will repeal this Bill, which proposes to categorise as criminals fishermen and those working in a key traditional industry, and imposes a range of fines which are punitive and vindictive and come on top of a range of fines which are already the highest in the EU. This is our commitment.</P>
      <P>A serious debate on the future direction of our fishing industry is long overdue in this House. The total failure of the Common Fisheries Policy at European level, the need for root and branch reform and the gross lack of support by this Government for the sector are issues that must be highlighted. A clear, defined national strategy to optimise the benefits of one of our most significant natural resources was never more needed. The Bill is the opposite of what is needed from a Government which is disinterested, in disarray and at loggerheads with itself as to fisheries policy. Rather than championing a fresh partnership approach to the management of the fish stocks around our coast, the Bill is simply an appalling mishmash of extreme and authoritarian measures which serve no purpose other than to drive a deeper wedge between the fishing industry and the custodians of the common good. I am astonished the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has the gall to present this Bill in its present form. It is well known he has the most serious reservations about many aspects of it. Does the Minister of State support this Bill as it is proposed to be enacted? This House and the fishing industry is entitled to know. Who is in charge of fisheries policy? Is it the Minister of State, who has been frogmarched into this Chamber by his senior Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey? We know this Bill has been re-introduced at the Minister&rsquo;s insistence. Has Deputy Noel Dempsey revoked the powers delegated to his Minister of State?</P>
      <P>There seems to be a peculiar form of guerrilla warfare ongoing between the two of them. Or is it the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Tuohy, who is in charge? He has certainly led the charge to have this Bill enacted, judging by a letter from him to the joint committee, dated 18 October last. We deserve an explanation. In the meantime I remind all three gentlemen that it is the prerogative of the Oireachtas to legislate and nobody else. We intend to oppose this Bill trenchantly at every turn, and not because we are not in favour of strong controls on fishing. We strongly support appropriate measures to conserve our depleted fish stocks. Such measures are essential if we are to confront one of the major environmental challenges of our time. We do not support or condone illegal fishing activity in any <Col N="885"/>form and such behaviour must be tackled vigorously.</P>
      <P>This Bill is patently not the answer, however. It is a wasted opportunity on the part of the Government to bring change to the fishing industry. Movements within the industry have been crying out for change for a number of years. I have spoken out in the past against the high level of fines imposed on Irish fishermen, in comparison with the EU average. I have also called on the Minister of State to decriminalise minor fishery offences. This Bill was an ideal opportunity to introduce such change. The following changes must be made to this Bill. It must provide for administrative and graded sanctions and it must decriminalise fisheries offences. According to published EU data, 86% of all EU fisheries offences are now dealt with by way of administrative sanctions. Why we are not acting in the same way defies logic.</P>
      <P>The section relating to the seafood manager should be deleted in its entirety. This move will not improve control and enforcement. As laid out in this Bill the seafood manager proposals lack accountability and undermine and sideline the role of the Minister. Instead, a fully independent office should be established. The automatic confiscation of catch and gear must be changed to allow the issue to be decided at the discretion of the courts. What is particularly appalling about this provision is that it only applies to Irish vessels. The fines and penalties detailed in the Bill lack proportionality and must be reduced and changed. We need to enforce the principle that serious fisheries offences attract serious penalties. However, we must not push overly harsh penalties onto minor offences. Such a position will not be of benefit to anyone involved. Finally, the provision on the use of firearms against fishing vessels must be totally deleted from the Bill. It is quite extraordinary that it was ever included in the first place. This provision is very much out of date. To have the Naval Service firing onto fishing vessels could produce a serious tragedy. I was absolutely astonished when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be like a third world war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has said, it would be like a third world war, or it could be like going back to the days of Queen Victoria.</P>
      <P>We need a Bill that is progressive and that will be acceptable to stakeholders. At a time when the Irish fishing fleet is already suffering because of outside issues such as rising fuel costs, we do not need this Government bringing in a Bill that will make its problems even worse. The background to the Bill shows that legislation in this area was needed. The Supreme Court judgment in the Browne <i>v.</i>Attorney General case found that the order in question was made under the wrong <Col N="886"/>section of the Fisheries Consolidation Act 1959. The effect of the judgment in another case, Kennedy <i>v.</i>the Attorney General, is more far reaching. This judgment provided for the following: a Minister of the Government may not, by statutory instrument, give effect to an EU policy or an Act of the institutions of the European Union using a power conferred by an Act, unless the Act contains an explicit power to give effect to the Act of the institutions of the European Union.</P>
      <P>It is not disputed that these deficiencies in national legislation need to be urgently addressed. I fully agree it is essential that these matters are speedily addressed. However, the proposals contained in the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 are not the only means of addressing these issues.</P>
      <P>There appears to be enormous haste on the part of the Minister to rush through this legislation. This is very surprising given that the matters raised in the judgment on the Browne case have been known to the Department for over two years. It begs the question as to why the sudden urgency. It is all the more puzzling when the judgment in the Kennedy case is considered. The Kennedy judgment surely impacts on the entire Government, not just the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department. There is a need to address the matters raised in a coherent and co-ordinated manner. The premise of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is that this legislation must be consolidated, but the ramifications of this Bill affect the 14 other Departments. Why is the same type of legislation not being introduced by other Departments? Perhaps the Minister of State will answer that. The <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for this Bill is based solely on the judgment. Why has the Taoiseach not told the D&aacute;il this will apply to all Departments?</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Consultation Act originally dates from 1959, but it has been updated and amended regularly since then to take account of changing circumstances. This includes Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the then European Economic Community. The development of the Common Fisheries Policy and the various enlargements that have occurred to the European Community are important developments within Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry. Hearings were held by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, of which I am Vice-Chairman, at the beginning of October. It was critically important and correct that the Chairman of that committee should have met the interested bodies representing the fishing trade. I compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn for having held that meeting. Up to that point there had been no meeting with the representative bodies. He was also correct to have held consultations with the fishing industry. The overall thrust of these meetings was very effective.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The committee&rsquo;s Chairman was also correct in meeting all the representative bodies last week in Brussels. I want to put on record a letter to the <Col N="887"/>committee signed by all the Irish MEPs, North and South. It says:</P>
      <P LI="1">A Chathaoirligh,</P>
      <P LI="1">Following the meeting last week in Brussels between the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, cross party representation of Irish MEPs and cross party representation from all the major Political Groups on the Fisheries Committee in the European Parliament, we have been requested, by all those present, to convey to your Committee a number of observations.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Nobody condones violations of fishing rules and regulations in any manner. The MEPs believe that there must be sanctions for such violations. Without interfering in Irish National legislation, they believe that sanctions and penalties in all EU Member States must be proportionate and fair.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">However some of the provisions of the Irish Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005, as proposed, were met by the MEPs, without exception, with total incredulity. In particular they found that some of the draconian sanctions which only apply to Irish fishermen to be not only extremely discriminatory but also in total contradiction with the European ideal and not least to the spirit of the Common Fisheries Policy. They underlined that this type of double standard would be unacceptable and would be rejected with force in their own countries.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">They found the general levels of &ldquo;the excessively inflated sanctions being proposed&rdquo;, which would apply to their own fleets in Irish waters, to be totally disproportionate to the offences concerned, with no relation whatsoever to sanctions for similar offences in every other Member State.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The Members of the European Parliament underlined that it was totally erroneous and misleading for anyone to suggest that &ldquo;Brussels&rdquo; was directly responsible for the levels of sanctions being proposed. The sanctions aspect of the bill is the sole responsibility of the Irish authorities, on a proposal from their Civil Service.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The MEPs underlined that the European Commission have consistently indicated that they have a preference for these matters to be dealt with by administrative sanctions.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The MEPs are in full agreement with this approach and would like to see fisheries offences de-criminalised. They underlined that almost 90% of all EU offences in the fisheries sector are dealt with using administrative sanctions.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The non Irish MEPs underlined that their own fishermen were directly concerned by the proposed Irish legislation. Consequently they have decided to raise the whole question of <Col N="888"/>sanctions, throughout the EU, in a number of ways in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Party Parliamentary questions with debate in full plenary session will be tabled to both the Commission and the Council.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The Fisheries Committee will seek independent legal advice on the different systems applied in the different Member States.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The Committee will also undertake whatever procedure that is necessary to put this whole vexed question firmly back on the EU agenda.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">We have been asked to request that your Committee keep the MEPs informed of the evolution of your draft bill. Furthermore were you to arrange a hearing on this issue, members of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Fisheries Committee, representing a number of EU countries, would be willing to travel to Dublin to testify.</P>
<P FLI="0">The letter was signed by Mr. Brian Crowley MEP, Deputy Alyward MEP, Deputy Coveney MEP, Ms Avril Doyle MEP, Ms Bairbre de Br&uacute;n MEP, Deputy Harkin MEP, Senator Higgins MEP, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neachtain MEP, Ms Mary Lou McDonald MEP, Ms Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness MEP, Mr. Jim Nicholson MEP, Deputy Ryan MEP, Ms Kathy Sinnot MEP and Deputy Mitchell MEP.</P>
<P>The Minister indicated that all this is coming from Brussels, but the letter indicated that such is not the case. Discussions at the meeting showed the diversity of approaches there could be to fisheries management within the EU. There is no set approach within the Union to fisheries management. The level of fines imposed in different EU countries and how different countries within the Union deal with fisheries offences is extremely varied.</P>
      <P>What is needed is a concerted effort by EU countries to adopt a similar approach to fisheries offences. We need to examine the efforts made in other countries in this respect. We need to learn from the policies of other Governments. We cannot be arrogant enough to presume we can write a Bill without examining the faults and failings of other countries. We need to examine the alternatives. The benefits to be offered by this approach make it even more disappointing when we see that the Minister did not take enough time to listen to the Irish fishing industry and examine policies abroad. It is not enough to restate existing laws, or to reinforce the current model of fisheries management without examining and considering alternatives. In many ways this Bill amounts to an outline of the law. Despite the fact that it is lengthy, it represents a skeletal outline of the law. In too many instances, the Bill delegates regulation making powers to the Minister. Sections 3, 9, 14, 15 and 44 all delegate regulation making powers to the Minister. In effect, we are being asked to debate and pass a law the true meaning and extent of which remains unknown. The Minister should not leave gaping holes in the Bill only to be later filled in by regulations. This sidelining of the Oireachtas is unforgivable. The <Col N="889"/>regulation making power in the hands of this Minister is a dangerous weapon. This Bill should show support to Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry. Instead, it will provide more hardship for the men and women who form the backbone of one of our most important indigenous industries.</P>
      <P>As multinationals come and go, we must learn to support the industries which will always stay in Ireland. As an island nation we need to protect our fishing industry. In this way, we can learn from our EU neighbours. Across Europe the majority of member states deal with fisheries offences by way of administrative penalties. For example in Spain in 2001, only four out of 3,595 fisheries offences went before the courts. Under existing legislation all fisheries offences in Ireland are tried through the criminal courts. The subsequent fines imposed are significantly higher than anywhere else in Europe. This has been acknowledged by a number of EU Commission reports. The EU report on behaviours that seriously infringed the rules of the common fisheries policy, highlighted the following fines. For fishing without a licence the average fine in Spain is &euro;1,463. In Ireland that figure is &euro;21,400.</P>
      <P>For a logbook offence in Denmark the fine is &euro;393, whereas in Ireland the same offence will cost &euro;8,455. In the UK, the fine for fishing for a species that is subject to prohibition is &euro;2,328. In Ireland the same offence will result in a fine of &euro;23,125. The list goes on and on. How this can strike anyone as an equal playing field is beyond me. This gives the impression that not only are we not supporting the Irish fishing fleet, but we are actually trying to stamp it out.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Representatives from the Irish fishing industry have campaigned for the implementation of a fairer and more appropriate system, with penalties that fit the offence. This campaign attempted to have existing legislation changed. However, instead of changing the legislation for the better, it has been made even worse. The implementation of the Bill in its current format will have an even more detrimental impact on the Irish fishing industry than did the existing legislation. There are genuine and serious concerns regarding the proposals in the Bill. The Bill provides for disproportionate fines for fisheries offences. These fines can reach up to &euro;200,000. The average fine across Europe for fisheries offences was &euro;4,600. As already stated, Irish fines for fisheries offences are already the highest in Europe. Nonetheless, the Bill proposes increases in the fines for certain offences. Fines for the use of illegal nets currently stand at &euro;63,487. The proposed new fine is &euro;100,000. Why are we raising a fine by more than &euro;35,000 when it is already far higher than the European average? For those found guilty of contravening quota notices, they will face fines nearly &euro;10,000 higher than existing legislation allows. One of the most dramatic increases is for those found in contravention of a licence. Those found guilty of that offence will face fines nearly ten times higher than those found in existing legis<Col N="890"/>lation. This Bill will raise the fine from &euro;12,697 to &euro;100,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to these fines, there is also the issue of confiscation of catch and gear. Currently, there is automatic confiscation of gear and catch at Circuit Court level. However, this confiscation provision is only automatically applied to Irish vessels coming before the court. Why is it that in the case of foreign vessels the court has discretion on whether to confiscate catch and gear? Why do foreign fishermen operating in the same areas as Irish fishermen get preferential treatment? Yet again, we have a damning indictment of this Government&rsquo;s attitude towards native fishermen.</P>
      <P>We oppose this Bill because it is extreme, excessive, unreasonable, unfair and undemocratic. We believe it is discriminatory and removes fundamental rights. It cedes far too much authority to unelected officials. Regardless of their individual calibre such officials must be accountable in law and to this House for their actions. It further exacerbates disproportionate penalties and criminalises the fishing sector. The vast majority of people working in this sector are decent, hardworking people of great enterprise, who are operating in an already impossible environment.</P>
      <P>This Bill was considered in detail in its present form by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, where it was almost unanimously rejected. It was regarded by the committee as being deeply and disturbingly extreme in its overall tone and detailed provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Not quite unanimously rejected.</P>

	<P>He said &ldquo;almost&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>We were told in a letter from Mr. Tuohy that failure to enact this Bill would leave the taxpayers seriously exposed to multi-million euro sanctions from Brussels, yet the committee was told quite clearly during a visit to the EU Commission last week that this was not the case. If the Browne case is so urgent, why is the Taoiseach not bringing every other Minister in here to introduce legislation? This case applies to every other Department. That has not been explained. This case is being used to bring in legislation that is not necessary.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an inappropriate, ill-judged, one-dimensional approach to the management of our valuable fish resources. The perception is that it is concerned with the consolidation of law and the remedying of constitutional deficiencies. However, in its present form, it has been hijacked. A legislative opportunity to introduce wholly unwarranted provisions and curtailment of a citizen&rsquo;s right to redress has been taken. During a visit to the European Commission last week, members of the Joint Committee on Communi<Col N="891"/>cations, Marine and Natural Resources were told that this was not the case.</P>
      <P>I note that the present law has not prevented an effective fine of &euro;40,000 being imposed on a trawler from Clogherhead earlier this week or the prosecution of further cases as we speak. I submit that if the intention was to rectify the deficiencies in law due to the Supreme Court case, it could have been done in a one-page Bill. Moreover, a thorough debate on fisheries could have been held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Similarly, if the consolidation and streamlining of the legislation passed since the 1959 Act was the intention, this would have been a sensible move. The issues pertaining to the imposition of fines could have been dealt with differently and the Supreme Court case could have been dealt with. This should have been applied in all Departments. However, this Bill uses these pretexts to enshrine a staggering increase in criminal sanctions. This will result in Irish law being even more out of kilter with EU-wide systems, and will discriminate against Irish vessels to boot, which is deeply troubling.</P>
      <P>The current Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, has sought to distance himself as much as possible from this Bill. He told the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that it was drafted before his time. Nevertheless, despite having major difficulties with this Bill, he has come before the House to promote it. It is wrong to introduce legislation on which there was no consultation with any of the representative bodies. I must compliment the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, for holding a public hearing on this issue. He was completely correct in inviting representatives from the Naval Service as well as an EU official who appeared before the committee and asserted that this Bill did not originate in Europe. We must have honesty in this respect. Who is driving this Bill? What are its origins and justification?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has claimed that this Bill was drafted before his time. What are Members to make of that? I note from evidence presented by fishing industry representatives to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that there was no attempt to consult them in respect of this Bill. I have met the fishing representatives. They are sensible men who represent a vast industry and, as an island nation, one should consider its growth. Such people have invested millions of euro in vessels and are supported by the banks. It is astonishing that they should have been ignored and that a Bill with a potentially far-reaching impact on their livelihoods could have been introduced <Col N="892"/>without any consultation. I am astonished that the civil servants and the Minister of State would agree to that. The lack of consultation is obvious when one reads the Bill. This morning, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources came before the House and stated that the Bill was necessary in light of legislation and penalties from Europe. That is untrue.</P>
      <P>I commend industry representatives on their reasoned analysis of this Bill. They are all businessmen who will apply the law and operate the system efficiently. As I have stated from the outset, this Bill will be amended when Fine Gael is in Government. We will not criminalise fishermen who are not drug barons peddling drugs but people who make a livelihood processing fish. Were they drug barons and not fishermen, the proposed legislation could not be more stringent. This Bill is designed to increase the severity of criminal sanctions in Ireland far beyond those pertaining in other EU jurisdictions. Under the existing legislation, the existing Irish sanctions are already far above the norm. In stating this, I repeat that Fine Gael is as determined as anyone else to stamp out illegal practices. No one should misrepresent our position.</P>
      <P>However, as I have already noted, a graded system of sanctions based on administrative law for all but serious offences, should be introduced. In this context I propose that sections 28 and 29 of the Bill, dealing with levels of fines and legal procedures, must be reconsidered in their entirety. I am not convinced by the argument that levels of fines up to &euro;200,000 are merely the maxima and are of little significance. The Judiciary will, not unreasonably, take their cue from the legislation and determine fines accordingly.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about section 15 which allows for further provisions over and above those required by EU law. What is the purpose of this except to have Ireland on an even more uneven playing field? Any sane person must surely reject subsections 18(5) and 18(6) which make provision for the firing of live ammunition into fishing vessels. This Bill must be redrafted in its entirety. While I suspect that this clause is intended to distract from other objectionable parts of the Bill, it cannot be left stand and must be withdrawn.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As I have stated, I am also unhappy with the composition of the proposed new position of seafood control manager and the relegation of the role of the Minister in section 41. This entire area requires re-examination. I am not in favour of reducing the oversight of democratically elected people, namely, the Minister and this House, in such vital matters. If the seafood control position is required as stated, the manager should be independent from the Department and everyone else. Regardless of their individual calibre, which I do not question in any way, the sweeping powers provided by this Bill to officers of the State are not balanced by the rights of citizens aggrieved to seek redress if they wish. This must be changed.</P><Col N="893"/>
      <P>The areas of concern I have highlighted are only a few of the critical issues which Fine Gael will oppose in this Bill. We are concerned by the proposed immunity from legal action of the registrar of fishing boats. The conditions for notifications to vessel owners are simply unacceptable and the discrimination between the treatment of Irish and overseas fishing vessels is another area of concern. We will not be fobbed off by promises to have the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials examine the Bill&rsquo;s deficiencies. While that tactic is employed constantly in this House, Fine Gael will not be fobbed off and will fight this Bill all the way.</P>
      <P>We ask that this Bill be withdrawn in its entirety and, failing that, we will vigorously propose sweeping and detailed amendments. It is a pity that Members should be holding this debate about such unacceptable legislation. We need to engage in a real debate which tackles the realities underlying the failure of the Common Fisheries Policy. We must make it a national priority to seek fundamental reform which will obviate any impetus towards over-fishing or non-compliance. We must also, as the scientific advisers to the EU, ICES, put it in their recent advice to the European Commission, &ldquo;break out of the vicious circle&rdquo; in which we find ourselves. We are at this juncture because this Minister of State fails to lead and has failed to direct his officials in pursuance of the real imperatives in the fisheries debate. In this Bill, he has turned his back on any emerging sense of reality or partnership, as evidenced by the development of industry-led regional advisory councils at EU level.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the antithesis of any sense of giving responsibility and a real role to fishermen in sustainably harvesting a resource whose health is of more importance to them than to any stakeholders. This Bill is a wasted opportunity to engage in the real issues and is a one-dimensional, knee-jerk response to the real difficulties besetting our fishing industry. It is regrettable that this Bill has been brought before the House without any real debate on the possibilities and enormous opportunities that could be taken.</P>
      <P>The proposed Bill does too much and too little. It does too much to address the Supreme Court judgments and possible non-compliance with national obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy and certainly does too little with regard to fisheries management and a vision for the fisheries industry in the coming years.</P>
      <P>It is well past time that this Government and the Minister of State who sponsors this Bill stepped aside to allow a fresher, more vigorous and imaginative approach to be taken by others if we are to do any proper justice to the coastal communities of Ireland. They need a real vision of the opportunities.</P>
      <P>One should consider the disappointing manner in which the Department handled the lost at sea scheme. It was not advertised transparently and raises questions as to who runs the Department. <Col N="894"/>Is it being run solely by the departmental officials or by the Minister of State who has been delegated to so do?</P>
      <P>While I genuinely congratulated the Minister of State on his appointment, I am disappointed that he felt obliged to bring this Bill, which runs counter to his fundamental beliefs, before the House. If possible, this legislation should be withdrawn. If not, substantial amendments must be included to facilitate a vision of the development of Ireland as an island nation and of the enormous development opportunities, which extend for 200 nautical miles.</P>
      <P>We are at a crossroads in the development of the fishing industry. The Government has missed a major opportunity to hold a debate on the industry&rsquo;s potential. Instead, it has introduced draconian legislation which, as Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn noted at our committee hearing on the Bill, is ill advised, ill judged and unwarranted. The Fine Gael Party will fight every section of the Bill and table a raft of amendments to change its ethos fundamentally. In Government, we will repeal this legislation which proposes, without foundation, to criminalise fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, and his key civil servants to the House. Before addressing the Bill, I will refer briefly to the apparent confirmation that a significant element of the marine section of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, including responsibility for ports, the coastguard, maritime safety and marine development, is to be transferred to another Department. This cannibalisation of the Department is a regrettable and retrograde development and casts an outrageous, appalling slur on the marine community, maritime workers and the general effort under way to develop the maritime potential of our island nation.</P>
      <P>It is also regrettable that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party failed to deliver the categorical promise made in its pre-election programme for Government in 2002 to appoint a Minister with responsibility for the marine and maritime affairs who would sit at the Cabinet table. Not only was the new Department not established after the new Government was formed, the relevant Department did not even include the word &ldquo;marine&rdquo; in its title. We now learn that the marine section of the Department will be moved all over the place. Will the remainder of the section be transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Food? The Minister of State, who I understood was to have been given a role in Government similar to that of Deputy Rabbitte when he was a member of the rainbow coalition, is set to be shafted by the Administration instead of being appointed a senior Minister of State with responsibility for the marine with a seat at the Cabinet table. This is a retrograde step.</P><Col N="895"/>
      <P>I pledge that if given an opportunity following the next general election to help shape a programme for Government alongside our Fine Gael Party colleagues, the Labour Party will insist on establishing a Cabinet level Department of the marine, the lead, integrated and coherent section of a maritime Department. Would any other island country settle for less?</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment made by the Minister of State on section 18 and the ludicrous provision on the use of force against fishing vessels. I also welcome his interesting commitment to establish an independent agency to implement the Common Fisheries Policy and sea fisheries control. This is the correct approach and begins to address some of the problems I have with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I accept the need for a serious, well regulated fishery control regime. I recently read a book entitled <i>The End of the Line</i> by a distinguished English journalist, Charles Clover who, with many other commentators, has graphically illustrated the dangerous state of world and European fishing stocks and the fundamental necessity to take seriously the maintenance of the fragile marine ecosystem. I also accept that the Secretary General raised genuine concerns about the legality of current fines and penalties for fisheries offences which resulted from the Supreme Court case taken by fisherman, Mr. Vincent Browne.</P>
      <P>Sustainability must be the key principle of fisheries management and is a prerequisite for a viable industry. Chapters 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for many important tools to achieve this result. The key failure of the Department in introducing this important legislation has been the virtual absence of consultation with stakeholders and their political representatives. As I noted, this failure has resulted in the developments of recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party continues to have fundamental problems with the Bill, which is the reason I oppose it in its current form and called a division. They include the level of fines and penalties provided for in section 4 and the lack of consistency with our EU partner states. Fishermen and the representatives of maritime communities have also raised a grave concern regarding the criminalisation of seemingly minor offences.</P>
      <P>It must be admitted that the Common Fisheries Policy, in many aspects of its administration, has failed. It was no surprise that at the previous general election, one of the major parties advocated abolishing the policy and starting over again. The monitoring of vessels from France, Spain and other countries is also a key concern. In addition, a question mark continues to hang over the independence of the seafood control manager. I welcome, however, the commitment the Minister of State appears to have made this morning. I will return to other concerns I have with the Bill.</P><Col N="896"/>
      <P>During my time in the House, I have never witnessed such a farcical circus as that which developed around the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. When I first read the text several weeks ago a number of issues leaped from the page, including the possible use of force against fishing boats, the high level of fines under the penalties for certain indictable offences, the transfer of the prosecution of sea fisheries offences from the Office of the Attorney General to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the precise status of the seafood control manager, an apparent element of retrospection in section 68 and the proposed passage of only 20 articles of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea 1982.</P>
      <P>I was amazed, however, that the Department did not provide Members with a lengthy briefing document on these and other important matters related to the proposed control regimes. I was also astonished that an abstract of the current proposed fisheries control mechanism was not submitted to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the summer session or by mid-September at the latest for discussion by Deputies and Senators and consultation between the joint committee and the main fisheries organisations and fishery harbour development bodies.</P>
      <P>Instead, we received the Bill a few days after a reportedly acrimonious meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party. A meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was then hastily convened by its Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn. At that meeting, several Deputies from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party stated on the record that they would vote against the Bill because it was extremely harsh and out of line with the regimes in place in our European Union sister states. Civil servants in the Department were effectively hung out to dry and blamed for the Bill, yet it was Fianna F&aacute;il Party Ministers who published and introduced the Bill. On two occasions this morning, during an electronic and a manual vote, Deputies reneged on their commitment and voted for every aspect of the Bill. What arrant hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have a debate on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>They engaged in hypocrisy. If the Deputy examines my career he will find that one of my fundamental rules has been to walk the walk if I talk the talk. Members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party do not have the honour and integrity to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting of the joint committee, the Bill, which was due to be taken the following day, was withdrawn. On three occasions I asked the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and Minister for Foreign Affairs, respectively, whether the legislation would be changed and when it would be reintroduced. It is the Government&rsquo;s duty to govern.</P><Col N="897"/>
      <P>The Secretary General of the Department provided Members with a lengthy written submission on the reason comprehensive legislation on the new control mechanism was a legal requirement on the Irish Government and other European Union Governments. As I stated, I have concerns about this matter. We had an outrageous circus around the Bill involving the joint committee and now, I understand, a gaggle of MEPs from whom we generally do not hear from one end of their five-year period of office to another is also involved. This was a disgraceful episode which should never be repeated on any other legislation.</P>
      <P>One useful initiative taken by the joint committee was to visit Killybegs earlier this year. The final words said to us on that two-day visit to the headquarters of the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, which I remember well, were that our fisheries should be viewed as a sustainable sunrise industry rather than what they believed was the constant vision of a sunset industry in terminal decline coming from many political quarters and the media. We said to them that surely involves serious control mechanisms and sustainability. However, the Killybegs fishermen left Deputies and Senators with the vision of a vibrant, viable and sustainable industry, one that the Labour Party and I share and at which we will always aim.</P>
      <P>The two P&aacute;draic White reports, Proposals and Recommendations for the Review of the Common Fisheries Policy, published in 2000, and Decommissioning Requirements for Ireland&rsquo;s Demersal and Shellfish Fleets, published last July, lay out some of the key requirements for sustainable and dynamic Irish sea fisheries. In February 2005, according to the second report, 1,415 vessels were registered under the new licensing system, with a further 755 traditional in-shore vessels, all less than 12 metres long, then being incorporated into the fishing fleet register. The total capacity of the Irish fishing fleet at the time was almost 87,000 gross tonnes, of which almost 42% was represented by 23 vessels of the pelagic fleet. The recent White report shows that Ireland&rsquo;s demersal quotas declined from 60,000 tonnes to under 40,000 tonnes between 1990 and 2005.</P>
      <P>Other important concerns raised in the report include the average age of vessels in the fleet, which was 26.5 years, the rising cost of fuel, and new safety standards, which were thankfully made mandatory for all vessels over 24 metres from 1 July 2005. On the basis of current trends, Mr. White was right to recommend the current decommissioning scheme to remove 25%, or almost 11,000 tonnes, of the whitefish fleet and the reduction of the scallop fleet to a level just under 5,000 kw.</P>
      <P>The report was rightly very concerned to ring-fence residual fleet capacity, a matter that must be addressed. Those reports from widely based committees in 2000 and 2005 rang alarm bells <Col N="898"/>regarding sustainability and mentioned two thirds of fish stocks in European waters heading for extinction, a grave and disastrous situation. It also made proposals for the involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process, something that certainly did not take place regarding this Bill or the farce surrounding it. Our visit to Killybegs and my knowledge of the other national fishery ports, including my own port of Howth, show that there has been no serious attempt to involve stakeholders.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my introduction, today&rsquo;s debate takes place against the background of the recent letter of the Secretary General, Mr. Brendan Tuohy, which refers to ongoing serious allegations of illegal fishing and overfishing. An investigation is under way, led by the Garda bureau of criminal investigation, into allegations of very serious overfishing at Killybegs. Mr. Tuohy refers at length to other serious allegations made by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Crummy, who I believe was a skipper out of Howth. All that has taken place in the context of renewed international debate on serious overfishing, failure to observe quotas and fishing effort, as outlined recently in many important works, including Charles Clover&rsquo;s <i>The End of the Line</i>, which I recently read.</P>
      <P>With 11% of EU waters and guardianship of 300,000 sq. miles of ocean, Ireland has a very special responsibility for marine ecosystems and fisheries management, and a well-regulated system of control is vital to its national self-respect. That is why I believe that our officials were right to address ongoing problems. I have said that I disagreed with some of the solutions, but their ambition to try to do something about matters was genuine, something that I also believe of the Minister.</P>
      <P>A sustainable and profitable future for Irish fisheries is possible, but achieving it requires that all relevant stakeholders and the Government work together to tackle major challenges for the industry. It is clear that sustainability and profitability should be the two key guiding principles regarding the future direction of the Irish fishing industry. In the long term, it cannot be profitable if it is not sustainable, since it destroys the very stocks that it needs to function. However, an unprofitable industry will not be sustainable either, as short-term economic pressures will lead to overfishing and non-compliance with the fisheries management regime. Sustainability and profitability are complementary objectives to ensure an Irish fishing industry that is globally competitive and has a vibrant long-term future.</P>
      <P>The issue of how to achieve high levels of compliance most effectively has been at the core of opposition to the Bill. It should have been part of lengthy discussions and consultations, in which I would have been delighted to participate. In many parts of the fishing industry around Europe, low levels of compliance with management rules have been a serious cause of unsustainability and the destruction of fishing stocks. It <Col N="899"/>is clear from research carried out on the issue that enforcement alone will not guarantee high levels of compliance with management rules. Structural problems, including unprofitability, lack of trust in the current fisheries management system, a low probability of being successfully caught and prosecuted and very modest financial penalties also contribute to high levels of non-compliance.</P>
      <P>Better enforcement is necessary for a more effective fisheries management system. However, trust and profit levels should also be addressed. Research undertaken by the strategy unit attached to Prime Minister Blair&rsquo;s Cabinet office found that in the UK, even if levels of fines and successful prosecutions were &ldquo;10 to 20 times higher than they are at present there would still be significant illegal landing of fish.&rdquo; It is also true that many fishermen and fishing communities in general do not see non-compliance with fisheries management systems as criminal. The criminalisation of fishermen has been a major issue with fishermen&rsquo;s groups in the wake of publication of the Bill.</P>
      <P>While I am bitterly opposed to any illegal activity that endangers the fish stocks of this island, in the international experience, the most effective route for implementing a workable and successful means of control seems to be to impose harsh criminal penalties only on the most persistent and extreme offenders. Other breaches should be dealt with by mechanisms such as administrative penalties, on-the-spot fines, and a transparent and predictable points system on licences similar to what happens to owners of motor vehicles found to be transgressing the law.</P>
      <P>Fisheries enforcement agencies should establish more capacity in forensic accounting and more concentrated targeting of high-risk vessels. Tracking catches from the initial landing to production and through the distribution chain would prove a much more effective way of deterring illegal activity and encourage compliance. I acknowledge that the Bill addresses some of those issues. Such traceability throughout the entire system would bring about more profound changes in fisheries management and ensure greater accountability regarding declared catches and production.</P>
      <P>Repeat and unrepentant offenders must be dealt with in the harshest terms, and criminal proceedings used in such instances. A key factor in establishing a fisheries management system with a high level of compliance is that there be a significant level of consultation and participation on the part of the fishing community itself and that it generate greater levels of trust among fishermen in management. It is in that area that we have failed most of all, since we have not involved stakeholders in the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Bill itself, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on section 18(6), which allowed for shots to be fired directly at or into a boat by officers attending the scene. That clause was quite <Col N="900"/>unusual in the powers granted to officers, which went well beyond the normal capability that officers have to fire warning shots or use force proportionate to the situation, especially when defending themselves from attack. It gave <i>carte blanche</i> to officers to fire live ammunition at or into vessels, which could have had grave and potentially fatal consequences. I welcome what the Minister said and note that Mr. Pichon, who came to us from Brittany, told us that under the French regime, if a vessel steams away from the French navy, it is never allowed back into national waters, also a very serious penalty.</P>
      <P>In even a cursory reading of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005, the levels of indictable fines and penalties in chapter 4 seem disproportionate and out of kilter with other EU regimes. I am aware of the high value of hauls made by large pelagic vessels, but fines of up to &euro;200,000 for a contravention relating to capacity plans of much smaller trawlers seem excessive.</P>
      <P>During the debate in the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Mr. Jason Whooley of the South and West Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation pointed out that, in the current era of high operating costs, a fine of &euro;50,000 is sufficient to put many fishing operations out of business completely. Mr. Whooley also made comparisons between penalties for licence offences in Spain and Ireland. In the former, it was &euro;1,463, and in the latter it is currently &euro;21,400. Log-book offences in Denmark carried a &euro;393 penalty, while in Ireland the figure was &euro;8,455. Conservation offences carried a fine of &euro;2,398 in the UK and &euro;23,125 in Ireland. Mr. Whooley and the fishing organisations made reasonable points regarding why sanction regimes throughout fishing countries should be reasonably standardised. Fishing industry representatives have raised the issue of graduated sanctions, with on-the-spot fines followed by more serious sanctions, culminating in a major deterrent fine, forfeiture and even imprisonment for recalcitrant repeat offenders. I stress that the industry itself has asked for that. It would be worth examining a points system, as proposed for the United Kingdom, and perhaps an automatic administrative penalty system where the costs of infringement are well known and transparent.</P>
      <P>A common criticism of the Bill in the fishing community since it was published is that fishermen would be criminalised for relatively minor offences and that this compares unfavourably with the civil law European Union states which have a system of administrative penalties for lower type business and competition regulatory offences. Section 40 makes a major change in the prosecution of sea fishery offences where provision is made for the transfer of prosecution from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions. There have been significant discussions of administrative fines regarding the powers of regulatory agencies in recent times. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Auth<Col N="901"/>ority, for example, has powers to levy administrative fines of up to &euro;5 million under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, asked his officials at the time to try to model a penalty regime for ComReg on powers similar to those of IFSRA. Some legal commentators have asked whether the IFSRA administrative fines are compatible with Article 38 of the Constitution which confers the administration of justice in criminal matters to the Judiciary. However, as the Labour Party leader noted in a letter on the matter to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on 6 October 2004, there may well be a category of administrative penalty which can be imposed by a lay regulator, as is done at EU level, without breaching the Constitution. The Taoiseach replied on 1 December 2004 to my party leader that there is already provision in our legislative code for the imposition of sanctions that arise in administrative proceedings, and the Taoiseach quoted the Stock Exchange, the Law Society, the Medical Council etc., with a right of appeal to the High Court. The Taoiseach appears to confirm, therefore, that a system of administrative penalties could be imposed, perhaps through the seafood control manager.</P>
      <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the recent appearance of the Naval commodore at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was the questions that arose over the monitoring of non-Irish vessels. More than 57% of vessels with hulls of more than 15 metres operating in the Irish zone were foreign vessels. There were 1,700 boardings of vessels by the Irish Navy so far in 2005, which led to 94 warnings and 33 detentions. Of those, 68 warnings were given to Irish vessels and 18 of the 33 detentions were of Irish vessels. Commodore Lynch noted, however, that there were significant difficulties in monitoring the quotas of non-Irish vessels. Many of those, for example, the Spanish vessels, belong to co-operatives where quotas were shared in a complex manner only the vessel&rsquo;s home government could hope to understand and monitor. In any event, Commodore Lynch said that the Naval Service &ldquo;does not have the means to police the quotas of other countries&rdquo;. He further stated: &ldquo;That is not our role&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The problem revealed by Commodore Lynch&rsquo;s very detailed and helpful exposition to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is not addressed in this Bill, and perhaps it should be examined. Irish fishermen and fishing communities have a legitimate, long-standing complaint about the cavalier manner in which foreign vessels can over-fish with impunity, devastate pressurised species and simply steam off home. We believed the establishment of the EU fisheries control agency at Vigo &mdash; the Minister of State will remember I advocated that it should be located in Killybegs &mdash; would lead to a level playing pitch throughout <Col N="902"/>EU waters but the reality until now appears to discriminate severely against our fishing industry. Surely it is possible to give the fishing monitoring service at Haulbowline a wider role in this Bill to liaise closely with the agency at Vigo, when it is up and running, and other EU navies to provide clear and transparent monitoring of all vessels in the Irish zone. Perhaps we should have a section in the Bill referring to that, something our civil servants might examine.</P>
      <P>Section 41 introduces a major new development with the introduction of a seafood control manager who will be appointed by the Secretary General of the Department and whose job will be to inform the prosecutor of any contravention of the Sea Fisheries Acts of 2003 and 2005 and any other food safety law breaches. The seafood control manager is also charged with the promotion of compliance with the Sea Fisheries Acts and the provision of policy advice to the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, serious concerns have been raised about the independence of this office. The appointment is made by the Secretary General and is responsible to the Secretary General and while I have no wish to cast aspersions on our hard-working civil servants, the seafood control manager will be appointed and be responsible to a non-elected official. Where is the accountability in that regard? The Minister of State mentioned earlier an independent agency but could we not use this Bill for that? Why come back to the D&aacute;il? Why not use the Bill as it stands to make the seafood control agency a type of independent regulator for the industry which would do its job in trying to protect stocks, manage the industry and be fair to everybody. At the meeting of the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources I raised with the Minister of State the possibility of the role of the seafood control manager evolving into a regulatory-type body and, therefore, I welcome his references this morning.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to other areas of concern which I hope to address also by way of amendment on Committee Stage. Section 11(1) refers to contravention of an obligation imposed by an EU regulation but given the Vincent Browne Supreme Court ruling, surely there is an obligation on the State to ensure that such a regulation is also codified in Irish law. The impact of the Vincent Browne case and the creation of indictable offences under statutory instruments that were struck down is the major reason the Secretary General of the Department gave for the urgent necessity to introduce this Bill. The Department maintains that no regime is in place currently but having spoken to fisheries leaders who came before our committee and who have been around the House in recent days, the reality appears to be that there is an ongoing regime of hearings, cases and serious punishments, despite the infirmity of the regulations as revealed in the Vincent Browne case.</P><Col N="903"/>
      <P>Concerns have also been expressed about the notice of the expected port of landing under section 12 and the notice of the revocation of an authorisation to fish by the Minister where unexpected difficulties arise for a master or owner, for example, if they must go to a different port because the boat is in difficulties or whatever. We may need to insert a clause to that effect in the Bill. The provision for destruction of fish in section 17(3) seems unnecessarily wasteful and problems may occur in future with the immunity provisions for sea fisheries protection officers in section 26.</P>
      <P>Section 28(5) appears to refer to the forfeiture of catch and fishing gear for Irish vessels. Again, that appears to be very unfair. Under section 41(6), the seafood control manager should also be required to report periodically to the relevant Oireachtas joint committee, which currently is the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. There is also a criticism that section 42 is too restrictive on the directions the Minister may give to the registrar general of fishing boats.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome Part 3 on the maritime jurisdiction of the State, including the exclusive economic zone and exclusive fishing limits. Section 54 incorporates Part V of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 &mdash; Articles 55 to 75.</P>
      <P>We discussed yesterday the short Bill the Labour Party has brought forward, the Mercantile Marine (Avoidance of Flags of Convenience) Bill 2005. That legislation seeks to insert section 91(1) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea into Irish law. The key point is that any vessel reflagging to the flag of another country would have to be able to have a genuine connection with the country to which it was reflagging. On a point of clarification, did the Minister of State say yesterday that he would support that Bill on Second Stage?</P>

	<P>I thought the Minister said he would support it in Private Members&rsquo; business. The Bill is an opportunity to bring the rest of the UN convention into Irish law and would greatly strengthen our powers in many aspects.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I have outlined the views of the Labour Party. We oppose the Second Reading of the Bill under discussion because it raises many contentious and serious issues which have not been addressed. The presentation of the Bill was disastrous in that it was published suddenly with a total lack of consultation. We accept the need for a serious control regime because sustainability and profitability go hand in hand. There will not be any profitability without sustainability. However, concerns have been <Col N="904"/>expressed worldwide about the sustainability of our marine ecosystems and resources.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problems with the Bill include the levels of fines and penalties in Chapter 4, the lack of consistency with the regimes of our EU partners, the genuine concerns raised by representatives of fishermen and maritime communities about criminalisation, the failure of the Common Fisheries Policy in monitoring and the issue of the role of the seafood control manager. Those are serious issues on which there should have been wider consultation in the preliminary discussion of the Bill. For that reason, I oppose the Bill. I have other minor concerns about the Bill but the circus surrounding its publication is a valuable lesson in how not to produce and bring important legislation to and successfully through the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The first issue that arises in regard to this Bill is the virtually unanimous opposition that has been voiced across the fishing sector and which has been reflected in this House by representatives of different parties. I commend the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, on his role in highlighting the deficiencies of the legislation and in seeking the advice of senior counsel in taking those concerns, which are shared by committee members, to Europe.</P>
      <P>This Bill is before us on the pretence it is urgently required to protect Irish taxpayers from massive EU fines. This is not the case. Another pretence is that it merely represents a consolidation of existing legislation and serves to correct loopholes in the law arising from a number of Supreme Court cases. This too is untrue. This legislation is evidence of the craven bankruptcy of the fishing policies of this and preceding Governments for many years. It presents fishermen as criminals and seeks to doubly criminalise them. It represents the failure of successive Governments to give any attention to the needs of the fishing industry and amounts to the selling out of one of our most valuable natural resources. The entire approach of the Bill is to discriminate further against Irish fishermen, who catch only 10% of the fish around our coasts. It goes further in setting staging sanctions in place in criminal law which are a recipe to drive decent fishermen underground or leave what was once a proud and noble industry.</P>
      <P>It is significant that of the 16 MEPs elected in this country in the 2004 European Parliament <Col N="905"/>election, 14 have signed a letter sent to Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, supporting the committee in calling for changes to be made to reflect the grave concerns expressed. In particular, the signatories contend there must be proportionality and fairness in the sanctions imposed by EU member states for fishing violations. They also point out that despite the claims made by defenders of the Bill, the sanctions it contains are not being imposed by the EU. They observe that the sanctions aspect of the Bill is &ldquo;the sole responsibility of the Irish authorities, on a proposal from their Civil Service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The fishing sector is clearly outraged by the proposals. In representations made to other Deputies and me, the most common theme is that the fishing industry sees the legislation as a further attempt to criminalise fishermen. Apart altogether from the level of fines that are proposed, fishermen are outraged by the provision contained in section 18 of the Bill for naval patrol vessels to fire live ammunition into fishing boats. I welcome the commitment given by the Minister in this regard today. Most of us have seen the photograph in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers of the Minister for Defence, the toy soldier, aiming a gun at the public. This was the experience for many of us involved in the fishing industry in the 1980s, particularly off the west coast.</P>
      <P>The fishing organisations have also stressed that they are not opposed to conservation measures. From my knowledge and experience as a fisherman, the best people to conserve our fishing stocks are fishermen themselves. Those involved in fishing lobsters off the west coast have used notching as a means of conserving the industry. In my own area of Tralee Bay, fishermen are to the forefront in conserving stocks. There would be no stock left were it not for the efforts of fishermen, who are best suited to engage in and have an appreciation of conservation. They of all people have most reason to wish to see stocks preserved because if they are destroyed, it is the fishermen who will suffer as their industry is forced out of existence.</P>
      <P>Fishermen do not accept, however, that they and their communities should bear the major part of the responsibility for stock management. Unlike other member states, the fishing organisations here do not even have a statutory involvement in stock management. They also rightfully believe that the major reason stocks in Irish waters have been depleted is the disproportionate part of the quota that may be taken by vessels from other member states. That is evident to those of us who live in coastal communities such as my own in the south west. Foreign vessels and vessels of convenience are taking the stocks from our waters with impunity. The Minister of State comes from a coastal community and must be aware of this. In addition to this problem is the existence of a massive imbalance within the Irish fleet in favour of one large operator which seems to have been allowed swallow up a greater part of the Irish quota at the expense of smaller oper<Col N="906"/>ators who are finding it increasingly difficult to survive.</P>
      <P>In the current atmosphere of distrust and concern, many fishermen are genuinely convinced that there are those within the Department who see this legislation as a means of forcing more of them out of business. In such a scenario, will we be left with one factory ship registered here, dividing the Irish quota with large operators from other member states? Is that what those who drafted this Bill want to see? It is the view of fishermen throughout the State. It is my view and that of Sinn F&eacute;in. Current policy is having a devastating effect on traditional fishing activity.</P>
      <P>As pointed out by fishing representatives, this Bill should not only be opposed but the debate on it should lead us to question the entire basis under which the fisheries sector is regulated, or rather misregulated. Sinn F&eacute;in has pointed out for years the scandalous terms under which our fisheries were sacrificed in the early 1970s as part of the negotiations for EEC membership. One of our potentially most valuable resources was in large part given away, to the extent that the value of fish taken from our waters by other EU fleets since accession outweighs the value of all direct payments received from the EU since 1973. The last calculation I saw for this, some three years ago, put the value of that catch at &euro;40 billion. These facts were completely ignored by a certain journalist who wrote in praise of this Bill some weeks ago and accused fishermen and political opponents of the Bill of being opportunists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the spin that came from a certain Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in a situation where the Irish fleet is given a quota far below that to which it is entitled given the proportion of EU fishing waters nominally under the sovereignty of the State. Furthermore, the fishing sector is not earning its full potential because of the numbers of unprocessed fish that are exported rather than being processed here. All these issues must be addressed domestically. That is impossible, however, until the Government goes to Brussels and insists on a complete and radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Such a reform should place stock conservation on a proper footing and ensure our fisheries are not at the mercy of those who are happy to fish them out and then move on. The fishermen of Irish coastal communities have nowhere to which they can move their operations. They cannot get licences to fish off the west African coast.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important for the future of the fishing industry that this Bill be defeated. I hope those on the Government benches who share the concerns of Opposition Members will vote in accordance with their convictions and those of the fishing representatives who have made their views on this well known. I pay tribute to the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee <Col N="907"/>on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who have voiced their concerns strongly and sought legal advice on the issue. I hope common sense will prevail. I appeal to the Minister of State, as a public representative from a coastal community, to adhere to the will of the people of his and other communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Coming from a coastal community, like Deputy Ferris, I am aware of the great dependence of my constituents on the sea for their livelihoods. The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill&rsquo;s proposals are perceived by many as overkill. While I accept the Minister claimed that much of the Bill was drafted before he took office, it still cries out for some rationality. Many have expressed outrage at the proposal for the Naval Service to shoot at trawlers that fail to stop when requested. Section 18 allows fisheries protection officers to shoot at or into a boat that ignores warning shots and refuses to heave to or fails to comply with an order to port. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that this section will be amended to take the gun out, so to speak. I wonder will he take the gun away from the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, pictured in newspapers this morning pointing a gun at the public. While there is a great need for fish stock conservation, it seems the small operator will be hit more.</P>
      <P>I recognise the efforts of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Deputies O&rsquo;Flynn, Perry and others travelled to Brussels to discover the Bill&rsquo;s proposals did not emanate from there. The draconian elements were actually proposed by the Government. This was a useful fact-finding exercise. That boats can be confiscated sounds very heavy-handed. It must be examined if conservation can be enforced in a different manner with the same results. It must also be remembered that the fines from Brussels are not of a criminal sanction. The Bill&rsquo;s proposals are excessive with no consultation between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the fishing industry. While it is important to keep an eye on proposals from the EU, it is equally important to keep an eye on what proposals are being made by the Government.</P>
      <P>There was a great need to help those using drift-net and draft-net fishing methods. There was an expectation that they would be bought out. However, this cannot happen unless everyone is treated equally. An individual fisherman catching 50 salmon would have to pay the same licence fee of &euro;325 as one catching several hundred salmon. If a buy-out was introduced, all operators would have to be treated the same.</P>
      <P>The Government feels the best way to manage our fisheries is through quotas. However to single out the drift-net and draft-net fishermen to bear the brunt of the conservation measures is unjust. The Minister&rsquo;s comments on quotas further <Col N="908"/>grinds the small operators into the ground, killing them off by slow strangulation. Lowering the quotas and reducing times allowed for fishing targets our coastal communities, depriving them of an opportunity to make a living. The small operator is getting the tough end of the wedge.</P>
      <P>The set-aside scheme to conserve stocks was proposed under which fishermen would be compensated for fishing losses. The Government claimed it would introduce the proposal if there was some means to measure the scheme. The criteria for measuring the scheme and counting fish stocks in rivers were fulfilled. However, the scheme proposed by the Government depended on owners of private fisheries putting money into the scheme. This was promised to fishermen in 2002 but it still has not been implemented. The Government failed to act on its own scientific advice in this regard.</P>
      <P>Moves are afoot to abolish the regional fisheries boards which must be properly debated. The review of the inland fisheries sections recommends the establishment of an advisory board. This centralisation of the fisheries board is akin to what happened with the abolition of the health boards, removing democracy from the whole system. Power is being taken back from the regions to central Government. We cannot throw out the baby with the bath water. We must ensure democracy is not removed from the system.</P>
      <P>A review of the boards was carried out two years ago. Why is it only now that it is coming to light? Why is the Minister responding in this way without any adequate notice to anyone involved in the industry? It seems to be a <i>fait accompli</i> to have one board for the entire country with sub-boards which will have no real say like the Health Service Executive. They will be accountable only to central Government but not to the people.</P>
      <P>While the fisheries boards are doing a good job in managing stocks, they do not have the adequate resources they need. If the fisheries go back to the stakeholers, will the resources follow to ensure the same protection of fish stocks? This is another example of increased centralisation, resulting in the reduction of local democracy. This will take away affordability from ordinary anglers. The fisheries boards appear to be underfunded. Their abolition is not panacea to address underfunding. This process will take five years. If all this comes to pass, what of the employment prospects of the fisheries boards&rsquo; employees, particularly when there are barely enough resources to keep the show on the road now?</P>
      <P>There needs to be continued protection of our fisheries with adequate resources. How will the IFA, anglers, the tourism industry and others affected have their say when the boards are replaced with the new authority? Will it be the same rationalisation process experienced by the health services at the expense of democracy? I would like the Minister of State to answer these questions if possible. The Bill is an over-reaction <Col N="909"/>and I agree with the necessary amendments that are to be tabled to take the gun out of the legislation, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this Bill, and we must address what is one of the worst and largest environmental scandals in this country and Europe, namely, the depletion, collapse and pillage of our fish stocks. Each year scientists and the relevant committee indicate the state of these stocks. The latest update was provided last year before a decision was made on the 2005 quota, with the state of various stocks being quoted.</P>
      <P>Irish Sea cod was deemed to be harvested unsustainably and overfished and a recommended zero quota. Irish Sea haddock was deemed harvested unsustainably and overfished and had a recommended quota cut of 10%. Whiting in the Celtic Sea was deemed harvested unsustainably and overfished, with a recommendation of cutting to the least possible quota. Celtic Sea sole was deemed harvested unsustainably and overfished, with a recommended quota cut of<?oasys _jy?>7%. Plaice was deemed at increased risk and overfished, with a recommended quota cut of 54%. Hake was deemed to have an unknown stock status and be overfished, with a recommended quota cut of 14%. In Donegal, cod was deemed harvested unsustainably and overfished, with a recommended zero quota. The mackerel quota was recommended to be cut by another 30% because of unsustainable harvesting.</P>
      <P>Such findings put us in a difficult position, and the Minister of State has my sympathy because it puts him in a tough position. It is a time of retrenchment in an industry which affects the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency, and he has my sympathy and support in his actions. He has my support in this Bill, although I am interested to see what amendments are tabled. We must address the scandal and begin to set the fishing industry on the correct course so it has a sustainable long-term future.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to criminalise anybody involved in fisheries, as the current system does to a certain extent. It has also criminalised the political system. Nobody is accusing the Minister of State on the issue of vessel licences for very large boats as he was not here at the time. There is no question of his involvement in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues have questions to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the view of almost everybody who examines it, the process in which certain large vessel licences were allowed stinks. The massive transfer of good public money to individual fleet owners in this regard was an utter scandal. The proposals we pushed through in the Oireachtas to separate the licensing and control from what could facilitate political corruption is welcome. All sides of this House would surely agree on this.</P><Col N="910"/>
      <P>It is remarkable that this Bill is required. We are spending a fortune on fisheries protection. Taking into account just the naval and air service and leaving aside court, administrative or departmental costs, we are spending approximately &euro;100 million per annum on fisheries protection. This is to land a fishery stock valued at the quay at approximately &euro;200 million. Half the money we receive from landing the stock is spent on protection. It makes sense to use such money correctly. Everyone will admit unofficially that there is a free-for-all in the industry for various reasons. There is no regulation or proper control and we must introduce it.</P>
      <P>The public wants this although certain individuals may not. The majority wish to see this money well spent. We spent the last five or six years spending about &euro;55 million in public money building up new vessels at a time when we knew the service would have to contract. We also issued licences for specific stocks at the same time. We have recently spent &euro;45 million decommissioning vessels. This is indicative of the madness afoot in our fisheries policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. The sooner this is recognised and addressed rather than having certain vested interests protected, the better. We would do the public a favour by doing so.</P>
      <P>The Vincent Browne case is an important issue and I am concerned this Bill does not address that issue in a manner that will stand up legally. I am told that the case has significant consequences in the fisheries and a range of other areas. It may require a referendum if we are not able to unpick in a legislative manner the problem analysed by the Supreme Court. I am concerned about the mechanism used in sections 14 and 15 which in a sense replicates the conditions under European fisheries regulations into Irish regulations. These are claimed to be supplementary measures. Perhaps the Government&rsquo;s lawyers are contending that these mechanisms will work in a clever legal way. I am concerned whether this will be so or whether further action might be needed. This is one of several concerns I have about the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with issues raised by some Deputies and would look to amend the Bill. However, in principle I support it. One change I wish to see made is a move to administrative sanctions. It makes sense to remove lawyers from the equation and I would like to remove lawyers from many aspects of the way in which society is run. There is much cost and difficulty involved in this and it makes sense to move towards administrative sanctions in some way. Article 31 of the European regulations on the issue state that: &ldquo;Member states shall ensure that appropriate measures be taken, including administrative action or criminal proceedings, in conformity with their own national law&rdquo;. It lists in some detail the ability to impose fines, seizure of vessels etc.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has contended that Article 34 of the Constitution requires us to turn to European law as it supersedes the Constitution <Col N="911"/>and directs us that administrative sanctions can be applied. I do not believe the European Union will do so as European regulation is consistent in being subject to national law. If the Minister of State is willing to take a legal route in solving the issue brought about by the Vincent Browne judgment, he may take a legal risk on this issue. I am interested to see details of the judgment on the matter from the lawyers in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Article 34 of the Constitution state that justice should be administered by judges in courts established by law except in special and limited cases that may be prescribed by law. Our job as legislators is to set the law and I would be happy to set a legislative precedent stating that we see this case as legally special where it is more appropriate to have administrative sanctions. This is supported in some detail by European regulations. I would like to hear the view of the Supreme Court judges that would argue that they are the only people who could possibly make judgment or allow forfeiture, fines, etc.</P>
      <P>It is about time that we as politicians took responsibility for leadership. It is difficult for us to do so in committee because of Abbeylara and other judgments but we can do it through legislation. The Supreme Court can then decide if our remit is being exceeded. Our actions would be backed up by European legislation. My colleagues in the committee and I believe this change would make sense as we must speed up the process and make it more definite, cheaper and easier to administer. Rather than having a representative go to Brussels to plead for a special case to go to Irish courts to impose administrative sanctions, we should instead try the legislative route. If it fails in the courts, so be it.</P>
      <P>Another loophole needs to be addressed in the European arena. We have a free-for-all in the fishery world where larger boats can travel long distances. It is almost impossible for national regimes to know the individual quota of a boat or the allocation it has. This system allows a Spanish boat off the south-west coast of Ireland effectively to fish at will. The only sanction it may have is if the net mesh is the wrong size or some similar issue. This will not cost it, and it will get away with massive overfishing that it may land off Ireland and in the boat&rsquo;s native waters.</P>
      <P>Until this loophole in the Common Fisheries Policy is addressed, we will continue to have a free-for-all. This does not just apply to Spanish boats. One hears stories of large new pelagic trawlers which could be taking a load of fish worth up to &euro;2 million in their cargo hold. We need fines of up to &euro;200,000 to impose some type of sanction against these boats. I have heard stories of these boats sailing from off south-west Cork, bypassing Killybegs as they head to land in Norway or Scotland. The people in charge of these boats know they can circumvent the quota <Col N="912"/>management system there. This is why the Minister of State&rsquo;s home port of Killybegs is quiet at the moment. We should address that issue and our own housekeeping.</P>
      <P>The Commission is currently taking action against Ireland on seven infringements of European fisheries legislation. The French Government was recently fined up to &euro;57 million for a similar infringement of regulations. We are facing such penalties here. The people will see us as doing no service if we ignore this issue and do not ensure that we have the very best of legislation to implement European laws. The greater and more important long-term issue is that the people will see us as having utterly failed if we allow the continued plundering of stocks that must be nurtured for the fishing community in the long term and also the Irish, European and international populations. I intend to support this Bill subject to the amendments that might be tabled on Committee Stage and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of fisheries has been to the fore of the discussions of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, of which I have the honour of being chairman. The second meeting of the committee discussed reform of the CFP and the then forthcoming TAC and quota negotiations at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council. The meeting lasted four hours and we heard from the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, departmental staff, fishery industry representatives, BIM and the Marine Institute. The joint committee has been exercised by fisheries.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as chairman, I have come to understand the pivotal role fishing plays in the sustainability and development of Ireland&rsquo;s peripheral coastal fishing communities. I am an advocate of trying to ensure that these communities survive and thrive. I do not have any deep sea fishing vessels in my constituency of Cork North-Central. I have no vested interests in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>This Bill was considered in detail at an all day hearing of the joint committee on 12 October. As part of my research, I discovered that the base legislation dealing with fisheries was the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, when Queen Victoria was the English monarch. This legislation was consolidated with the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959. In 2005, this Bill rewrites and updates Part xiii, which deals with fisheries. I welcome this move but have certain reservations. Only a few weeks after the bicentennial celebration of Nelson&rsquo;s victory at Trafalgar we find an Irish Bill proposing to allow the firing of a gun at or into a boat. When I recently mentioned this in Brussels, there was astonishment that Ireland would propose such legislation, and particularly at the thought that a gun could be fired into or at a vessel of another member state. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intention to remove this provision from the <Col N="913"/>Bill. Perhaps we could let Queen Victoria rest in peace.</P>
      <P>I echo what the industry put on the record when it presented to the joint committee and the position of the vast majority of the committee&rsquo;s members, which has been expressed by a number of Deputies today. Fishery offences and infringements of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy must be sanctioned and cannot be tolerated. I want it to be understood in the clearest terms that no one condones illegal fishing.</P>
      <P>I mentioned Brussels a moment ago. Following the hearings on 12 October, the joint committee agreed to have a delegation visit Brussels to explore the EU&rsquo;s thinking behind the enforcement of the CFP and how this has impacted on the legislation proposed. The visit was informative. We met Commissioner Joe Borg&rsquo;s <i>chef de cabinet</i>, members of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Fisheries Committee, Irish MEPs and Commission officials. We discovered two central issues, namely, Commission or competency creep and proportionality. This Bill is not proportional, which is a key issue the Minister must address before he takes it on to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As mentioned by my colleagues on the opposite benches, the Commission&rsquo;s reports highlight the principle of proportionality. A total of 86% of all fishery offences are dealt with by administrative penalties across the EU. The Bill proposes to rewrite Part xiii of the 1959 Act and we therefore have the opportunity to introduce legislation to put in place a fishery management, control and enforcement regime than could be the best in Europe. My concern as an elected legislator is that what will be enacted in this legislation will not be fair and proportional. In my reading of it, I do not believe the Department is adhering to the proportionality principle.</P>
      <P>In correspondence from the Department pertaining to a commentary on the need for this Bill, I note a justification proffered that member states have strong, effective, dissuasive, transparent fisheries management and enforcement systems. I also note from the Commission&rsquo;s documentation that contrary behaviour should attract proportional, effective and dissuasive penalties imposed by national authorities. The one difference between the Department and the Commission&rsquo;s document is the word &ldquo;proportional&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What is Commission or competency creep? I was unaware of it prior to going to Brussels. I recommend that all Deputies who are committee members visit Brussels more often and see at first hand how the work taking place in the EU impacts on the legislation we consider in the D&aacute;il. I am echoing some of the points the Acting Chairman has been making for a long time. Commission or competency creep can best be seen in section 14 where the Minister can, by regulation, prescribe measures in respect of the CFP on those who buy, handle, weigh, transport, ship, land, process, store, document or sell fish. The Commission has sought to creep the competency of <Col N="914"/>the CFP from the sea to the land. Through this section, the CFP has come ashore, grown legs and begun chasing processors.</P>
      <P>Categorically speaking, there should be no place for those involved in anything to do with illegal fish, namely, undersized fish. However, there is a world of difference between illegal fishing and the catching of illegal fish. I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that we must introduce Irish legislation to criminalise those who catch or are involved with undersized fish. From this benchmark, there must be administrative sanctions for lesser offences. We must be proportional, set the mark for the worst offence and work downwards. This legislation sets the bar as high as possible for relatively minor offences and then pushes into the stratosphere the sanctions to be imposed for serious offences. This is as unreal as the Commission&rsquo;s expansion of its competency.</P>
      <P>Last night I read the European Court of Justice judgment in case No. 304/02 Commission <i>v</i>. France. In paragraph 73 of the judgment, I found that the court knew about proportionality, as it held:</P>
      <P LI="1">Accordingly, in light of the detailed evidence submitted by the Commission, the information adduced by the French Government is not sufficiently substantial to demonstrate that the measures which it has implemented so far as concerns the taking of action in respect of infringements of the fisheries rules display the efficacy, proportionality and deterrence necessary to meet its obligation to ensure the effectiveness of the Community system for conservation and management of fishery resources.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There is the word &ldquo;proportionality&rdquo; again. That seven cases have been initiated by the Commission against Ireland and the Department has made members of the joint committee aware of the Commission&rsquo;s case against France and that, in terms of some of the cases taken against Ireland, there is created a potential significant exposure to the State.</P>
      <P>Is the main reason the Commission has taken seven cases against us because our legislation imposing sanctions for fisheries offences is so appalling that the Department must propose this legislation? Alternatively, is it the truth that the Department has at an operational level been poor in how it manages the control, monitoring and enforcement required by the CFP and that, in the main, has been legislated for by this Oireachtas at the rate of nearly one new or amending Act every two years? The Department comes to the Oireachtas with a proposal for stronger and more draconian legislation. I want to ensure we have a regime in place that covers Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the CFP. I do not want Ireland to be continually exposed to the European Commission identifying deficiencies which as a member state Ireland must address.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Since 2000 the Oireachtas has passed the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2000, the Fisheries <Col N="915"/>(Amendment) Act 2001 and the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 and we are now dealing with Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. In terms of legislating for fisheries this Oireachtas is becoming a serial legislator. It is almost an annual event, like the budget. Will the Department ever get it right?</P>
      <P>I will consider the matter of the Supreme Court rulings in the Browne and Kennedy cases, which in addition to the European Commission actions against Ireland, the Department are using as part justification for the need for this Bill. I do not dispute that the Supreme Court rulings have created an obligation to amend legislation. This is not confined to the Department. The Supreme Court judgments in the Browne and Kennedy cases have serious implications for all Departments. However, if all Departments take the same attitude as the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in how they seek to comply legislatively with the Supreme Court rulings, then the electorate will wreak havoc come the general election.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Perry stated, the Supreme Court judgment in the Kennedy case ruled:</P>
      <P LI="1">If s[ection].223A were considered an appropriate basis for the statutory instrument it would, as pointed out by Keane CJ, in Browne <i>v</i>. Ireland. be used to circumvent s[ection] 224B (quite apart from any consideration of s[ection] 3(3) of the Act of 1972).</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is interesting in the context of the Supreme Court judgment in the Browne case which held:</P>
      <P LI="1">[T]hat it was not open to the Minister to use the mechanism of s[ection] 223A of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 (inserted by s[ection] 9 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1978, amended by s[ection] 4 of the Fisheries (Amendment)Act 1983) to create an indictable offence by means of statutory instrument as a method of giving effect to Council Regulation (EC) No. 894/97 of 29 April 1997 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1239/98 of 8 June 1998.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The spin emanating from Leeson Lane is that as a result of the Supreme Court judgment, there is no effective fishery law and Ireland is leaving itself swinging in the wind. This is untrue and must be nailed right here and now. Why did the Department sit on its hands since 2003 when the Supreme Court found a deficiency in section 223A, the very section that was again found repugnant in 2005 in the Kennedy case? Is the Department slow to learn a lesson? Why did the Department have to wait a full two years to be told again by the Supreme Court that section 223A was deficient before it brought this Bill forward?</P>
      <P>The defect found by the Supreme Court was that if it is required to give effect by statutory instrument to an obligation of an EU policy or an <Col N="916"/>EU legislative provision, it must be referenced by an Act of the Oireachtas. As my colleagues have said, this applies to every Department. To put about the spin that because of the Supreme Court judgments in the Browne and Kennedy cases, we have no effective fisheries law is patently dishonest.</P>
      <P>The hearings of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on 12 October highlighted the fact that in proposing this radical rewriting of Part XIII of the 1959 Act, the Department consulted no one. This is astounding and has been made all the more incredible when it was known that the Department did not subject this Bill to regulatory impact analysis. I know of no other Department or division of a Department which would behave in such a fashion, ignoring a complete industry together with undermining the viability of peripheral coastal communities without any regard to consultation. Partnership means nothing to the administrators of our national fishery.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a unique place in legislation proposed to the D&aacute;il for consideration. It is very rare to find a Bill that proposes too little and too much at the same time. It has too little to address the legitimate concerns of the fishing industry and to give Ireland an effective and functioning fishery control regime and too much to address the Supreme Court judgment and Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>I want to consider the EU general principle whereby a member state cannot discriminate on the grounds of nationality. I am aware of how European Court of Justice case law has moved out this principle so that member states can impose greater obligations on their own nationals than they can enforce on nationals of other member states. This is called &ldquo;gold plating&rdquo; and as a legislator, I want this to stop. I do not support the provisions contained in this Bill whereby Irish fisherman will have, as a statutory consequence of conviction on indictment, automatic forfeiture of gear and catch, while foreign fishermen will have the privilege of the Irish court deciding if they will forfeit their catch and gear. This Bill proposes to continue this discriminatory practice and amendments should be brought forward to change this. I ask the Minister of State to bring forward those amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The joint committee agreed to go to Brussels and Deputy Broughan was present when this was agreed. No member of the Fianna F&aacute;il party has stated they will oppose the Bill. As Chairman of the joint committee I proposed to bank the questions. I informed Deputy Broughan that the Fianna F&aacute;il party would not go offside on this measure but would endeavour to persuade the Minister to make significant changes to the Bill and that we would not be voting through the lobby with the Deputy. I wish to put this on the record of the House because Deputy Broughan gets carried away on occasion.</P><Col N="917"/>
      <P>Our committee has taken the unusual step of engaging the services of a senior counsel to advise us on this legislation and to advise us on the proportionality and administrative sanctions. The committee will lay this independent advice before the Minister on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan seems to think we were in a circus in Brussels. I think it was a wonderful opportunity to meet the Irish MEPs and the EU Fisheries Committee. The Irish MEPs will appear before the joint committee to engage in a discussion on the Common Fisheries Policy. The EU Fisheries Committee members will also be invited to attend a general discussion on uniformity, proportionality and other matters of common interest to all EU countries.</P>
      <P>I refer to EU document COM (2003) 782 which outlines reports from member states which have seriously infringed the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002. Belgium was guilty of 49 serious infringements with an average fine of &euro;1,143, Denmark had 442 infringements with an average fine of &euro;622, Germany had 118 infringements with an average fine of &euro;820, Spain had 1,785 infringements with an average fine of &euro;2,126, France had 288 infringements with an average fine of &euro;2,367, Ireland had 26 infringements with an average fine of &euro;11,978 and the United Kingdom had 125 infringements with an average fine of &euro;8,795. The House can see the need for uniformity of sanctions across the EU. Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy and the UK have the largest fleets with a total of 68,392 vessels out of the 76,942 vessels registered on 1 January 2003. Ireland has 1,437 vessels, or 1.8% of the European fleet. Ireland received 0.38% of the sanctions, yet has the highest level of fines. There is a clear need for uniformity across the EU in levels of fines imposed. This was clearly the view of the EU official, Mr. Gallizioli, who appeared before our committee on 12 October and stated that the Commission believes &ldquo;an administrative system is better than a criminal system.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to this debate with great interest. The major question that occurs to me is: who is in favour of this Bill? I have seen the most half-hearted presentation of a Bill by any Minister in the presentation from the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. Clearly his heart is not in it.</P>
      <P>At some stage I thought I detected from the Opposition benches behind me some strong semblance of support for this Bill in the contribution of Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party. Despite his strong rhetoric in favour of the Bill, he spoiled it all by stating that he was very much against the fact that there was not provision for administrative sanctions as that is the central issue in the Bill. While I understand that, coming from the green corner, he had to make those noises, even he voiced a strong objection to a Bill that does not contain the central feature that any<Col N="918"/>body with an interest in this industry wants and that he also wants.</P>
      <P>Then we heard the main contribution from my colleague, Deputy Perry. On behalf of the Opposition, he set out clearly and unequivocally that Fine Gael is utterly opposed to the Bill in its present form. Fine Gael, in Government, will repeal this Bill. That was largely supported by the spokesmen from the Labour Party and from the Technical Group. Then we heard possibly the strongest criticism of the Bill so far from the Fianna F&aacute;il Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I also am aware, from comments made locally in my constituency, of the opposition of Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher and constituency colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>
      <P>Who is in favour of this Bill in its present form? Why are we debating the Bill as it is presently formulated? My first simple message to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is to go back to the Government and tell it nobody in this House, which is the supreme Legislature, is in favour of this Bill as presently formulated. We will adjourn this debate shortly. There will be an opportunity for consideration. I suggest that opportunity should be used for two purposes: first, to withdraw the Bill; and second, to come back to us with a reformulated Bill.</P>
      <P>No doubt anybody with an interest in this industry recognises there is need for a Bill. As the principal Opposition party, we accept that. We want a sustainable fishing industry. We want a legal framework which will work and to which our fishermen can give adherence. We accept that following the Supreme Court judgments there is a need for a Bill. We want a Bill with some vision about the development of the industry. We do not want a Bill that crucifies our fishermen, which really is the effect of the Bill as presently formulated.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister of State speaks reasonably about his willingness to consider amendments. Since he has been forced apparently by the Government to bring this Bill as presently formulated before this House, his reasonableness is not what counts. What counts is the willingness of the Government to take on board the major issues that arise in the context of this Bill and the proper way to do that is for the Government to withdraw the Bill and allow the Minister of State to come back to this House with a new Bill that takes those provisions on board.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a chapter on restriction, a chapter on licensing, a chapter on penalties, a chapter on forfeitures of catch and a chapter on forfeiture of vessels. One can sum it up under the headings of restriction, penalty, confiscation and forfeiture. That is not the message that should come from this House to our fishing industry.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me before we adjourn I will focus on the central feature of the Bill on which all parties are agreed, the Bill does not provide for administrative and graded sanc<Col N="919"/>tions to decriminalise fishing offences and it must do so. That is the central issue on this Bill and I do not think anybody in this House will disagree with me. Why does the Bill not include that?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State quoted the provisions of the Constitution. I accept that under Article 34 of the Constitution, &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution&rdquo;, but while it provides &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law,&rdquo; that is more to do with the issue of hearings in public. Currently in many instances we have a system whereby, with the consent of an offender, administrative sanctions can be applied. Why can we not have a similar system for our fishermen? Why is the message &ldquo;please stop treating us as criminals&rdquo; that comes loud and clear from Mizen Head to Malin Head not taken on board by the Government in the context of this major fisheries legislation?</P>
      <P>No doubt this legislation hardens and fastens the criminalisation rules as far as fishermen are concerned and in some instances it is utterly draconian. Despite the expressed good intent of the Minister of State, surely he does not think he can convince this House, let alone the fishermen, that increasing a fine by 800%, from approximately &euro;12,000 to &euro;100,000, is a minor matter. What thinking gives rise to that kind of approach in the Bill?</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out by colleagues in this House, we have something to learn from the other members of the European Union. There is a natural long-standing tendency for us to follow the UK system of legislation. I accept we are part of the common law system and on independence we inherited a corpus of legislation. Our system is much the same and there is an understandable tendency to follow on with that system. At the same time, we have been long enough in the European Union to know that there are benefits from the European system. The European system, the old Code Napoleon or the continental law system, has major advantages in many ways. It has particular advantages in the way it deals with fishermen.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else in this House, I will not proclaim that all our fishermen are angels as far as the law is concerned. I do not think anybody will suggest that. There needs to be a legal framework to ensure that when they err and stray over the legal line they are dealt with, but let us ensure that it is reasonable. I will come back to that matter.</P>
      <P>I am stunned by the following issue that has emerged here and has been touched on by a number of colleagues. How can we justify a system which discriminates against our own Irish fishermen as opposed to fishermen from other member states of the European Union? Often I have seen cases where nationals of other member states of the European Union bring to court a <Col N="920"/>claim that they are not being treated as well as we are being treated, and sometimes with justification, but I have never come across the opposite situation where the Government brings before the House a provision, which I accept may be a continuation of an existing provision that should have been challenged previously, that we treat our own fishermen worse than fishermen from other member states.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, presented the background and context to this Bill on Tuesday. He summarised its contents up to and including section 20. I will resume the summary, beginning with section 21.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A new section 21 was introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad. The section transposes an optional provision of another EU Council directive, Directive 2001/23/EC, which provides that in a transfer of undertaking, the transferor must notify the transferee of all the rights and obligations arising from a contract of employment existing on the date of transfer which will be transferred to the transferee. If a transferee is required by a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal to pay compensation to an employee because of a failure of the transferor to provide the necessary information, the transferee has a right of action in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover some or all of the amount paid in compensation. There were another three optional provisions which have not been agreed with the social partners and which I was not in a position to introduce. However, I welcome the inclusion of the new section 21, which has been agreed.</P>
      <P>Section 22 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title of the Bill. It also provides that the Bill shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders.</P>
      <P>The Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill 2005 seeks, as it must, to transpose fully the EU directive on information and consultation into Irish law. As I mentioned, in framing this legislation there was extensive consultation with the representatives of the business community and the representatives of employees. There was some delay in transposing the legislation because there were very complex issues involved and it proved very difficult to reach con<Col N="921"/>sensus on them. However, on the plus side, the additional time has resulted in a far more balanced Bill. The debate in the Seanad has also informed the text of the Bill. A number of amendments were accepted in the Seanad and I made some technical amendments.</P>
      <P>The legislation represents a balanced approach within the requirements of the directive. The provision of information and consultation of employees is good practice. The Bill ensures workers will have a right to information and consultation in regard to their companies. The approval of the workforce is key to ensuring that both negotiated and pre-existing agreements reflect the concerns and meet the needs of both sides. Employees&rsquo; representatives are given stronger protections and rights of redress in this Bill than in any other employment rights or industrial relations Bill to date.</P>
      <P>The Government approach to the Bill has been to facilitate a co-operative and positive approach by individual companies and their employees in meeting the objectives of the directive. This approach has resulted in a Bill which recognises the voluntarist tradition in Irish industrial relations and which will assist companies and their employees in establishing effective and efficient information and consultation arrangements.</P>
      <P>This Bill is without doubt a welcome addition to our employment rights and industrial relations legislation and represents an important opportunity to foster and deepen customised partnership-style approaches to anticipating and managing change. The Bill affords the opportunity to meet the challenge of embedding partnership at enterprise level and making it a reality for workers and employers.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage in the Seanad, I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members on all sides of the House. I will continue to approach the Bill in an open-minded fashion. It is true that the debate in the Seanad, on all Stages, had a significant impact. I accepted some amendments to which I might have been less open at the commencement of the debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague Deputy Hogan, who cannot be present today. He sent a message stating I might deputise for him and time will tell whether I have been capable of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no abler man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the House I will do my utmost.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill for a number of reasons. It relates to a number of issues on which I and other Members of the House have had occasion to comment in recent years. It transposes into Irish law an EU directive and has a number of technical provisions that <Col N="922"/>need to be re-examined in respect of companies of different sizes. This applies in my constituency as well as in others.</P>
      <P>The concept of consultation in industrial relations is very important, from the points of view of both the employer and employee. One of the saddest cases on which we have had to reflect in this House was that of An Post. In a recent dispute involving the company, there was virtually no consultation, no establishment of contact and no information given to employees other than that they should take or leave the package on offer. Another example, from my constituency, concerns the closure of Magna Donnelly and the consequent relocation of 400 employees to various locations throughout the world. The point the employees made repeatedly concerned the lack of consultation and prior knowledge, and the fact that they received no indication the closure was likely to happen when revision took place within the company and when there was a reconstitution of objectives over the preceding years.</P>
      <P>We need to consider carefully the damage done by the lack of consultation to the trust that needs to exist between employers and employees. I am not so certain the Bill will emphasise and create an adequate basis for the kind of consultation required in the workplace. Financial circumstances within a particular company may change from day to day and it is therefore necessary for employers to engage with employees at a much earlier stage regarding issues that could affect the future of both. The trust and confidence that can develop through consultation are beneficial not only to the firms concerned but also to the national economy and, consequently, all citizens.</P>
      <P>I presume the legislation applies to pension entitlements, which concern a great number of employees. We have encountered circumstances in which people who were due to retire, or who had retired, suddenly found their pension entitlements were not as they had anticipated. The degree to which dialogue was established with their employers was questionable. Had adequate dialogue been established, there would not have been any surprises. It would have been quite possible to identify the pitfalls and snags and eliminate them at an early stage, thus removing them from the arena as a source of irritation and undue hardship to those pensioners with a grievance and, in some cases, as a source of industrial action.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for circumstances in which a firm is sold, transferred, merged with another or subsumed into another corporation. Very often, one of the major concerns of employees relates to their entitlements when their firm is taken over by a bigger concern. In most cases, employers go out of their way to ensure their potential employees&rsquo; rights are guaranteed, but not in all cases. Some very sizeable corporations are notorious for ignoring the fundamentals in this regard. A certain dispute comes to mind but I do not want to exacerbate it by referring to it.</P><Col N="923"/>
      <P>It is so sad, at this time in our economic development, that basic requirements are not met in respect of consultation, the establishment of dialogue and trust, and willingness to recognise the rights and entitlements of those who have worked all their lives on behalf of a firm. Employees ought to have their rights transferred with them to a new employer even if the new employer regards this as a burden. If one buys a corporation or takes over a firm, responsibilities in this regard come with it. One must accept it warts and all and assume one&rsquo;s responsibilities regarding employees&rsquo; entitlements. For that reason, there should be no apology on anybody&rsquo;s part in regard to having the entitlements transferred with the employee to protect the employee.</P>
      <P>The definition of agency workers is an important issue which has given cause for concern in the past. We must determine whether the agency or the firm with which the agency worker is employed is the body with which the consultation should take place. The Bill proposes that the agency is the employer. I disagree. The employer with which the employee is directly employed should have the major responsibility.</P>
      <P>There are many agency workers in Ireland at present, particularly in nursing and the medical sector. It has been suggested that they are not always fairly treated. They come from many countries to work here, including from as far away as the Philippines. They are paid a salary by the employer but an amount is also deducted by the agency. This was originally intended to reduce administration in the health services but, while it is possible it makes employers more effective, I am not sure this is the case. This important area must be carefully considered. My colleague, Deputy Hogan, will have numerous exchanges with the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, on how this situation can be improved.</P>
      <P>There is ample scope for the improvement and strengthening of regulations. The dialogue proposed in the legislation should take place not only with the agency but also with the firm to which the agency has referred the employee. Otherwise, the dialogue would only be with the agency, which is of no benefit. The unfortunate employee may not be willing to tell the agency of the true circumstances of the employment or, <i>vice versa</i>, the agency may not treat the employee well but the employee may be fearful of telling the direct employer of the true situation, with the resulting consequences.</P>
      <P>Given the large number of non-national employees now in the country, some for periods of up to 12 years, it is particularly incumbent on us, as a nation and having regard to our history, to ensure that every possible action is taken to ensure that the rights and entitlements of immigrants are guaranteed and safeguarded. Not to do this would be a sad reflection on our society in the way that some current events are a sad reflec<Col N="924"/>tion. I am sure every Member has a relative who in the past had to pick up a suitcase and go abroad to eke out an existence. My parents did so. We were not sufficiently privileged to be able to stand aloof from the mass emigration that affected large parts of the country, including Dublin city. When we think about entitlements, rights and dialogue, we should put our experiences to good use in protecting the rights and entitlements of others who are less fortunate than us.</P>
      <P>Reference was made in the Seanad to the specified number of employees required within a non-unionised firm before the triggering mechanism would kick in to enable dialogue to be established. This will arise again in proposed amendments. There is concern among IBEC representatives and potential employees that the number of employees suggested for a large firm should be reconsidered with a view to identifying the optimum number rather than having too small a number disrupting the organisation and the flow of employment for others. At the same time, we must ensure that the number is representative of the views consistent among employees of the firm so that they would have the entitlement to use the opportunity to proceed.</P>
      <P>As we know from past events, it is important to address the issues raised by an individual regardless of whether he or she is right. An individual should have some forum in which he or she can raise concerns with his or her peers in the first instance. From that starting point, it should be possible to establish the relevant number within a firm who can legitimately initiate the dialogue envisaged under the Bill. The importance of this, as noted in the Seanad, is that it ensures that the employees involved are sufficiently representative of their peers while at the same time ensuring that an individual or a few people have the opportunity to raise an issue with their peers in the first instance and then, it is to be hoped, progress the issue further and proceed to agreement.</P>
      <P>The Bill is increasingly necessary because we live in rapidly changing times. We hear daily of mergers and takeovers and these will happen more often in the future than in the past. Telephone services in Ireland were nationally controlled some years ago but were privatised and have been subject to one takeover after another since then, and will be subject to more. I am not sure that these practices are beneficial to the consumer, employees or employers. As the world of modern economics accelerates, the need for the shareholder to achieve a dividend at regular intervals may be seen as more important than the need for fair play and the provision of a service to consumers.</P>
      <P>Union houses have operated effectively for many years. It is important from an employer&rsquo;s perspective that a union or representative group is in place with which the employer can negotiate and engage. Otherwise, a group would have to be <Col N="925"/>appointed within a non-union firm, a matter which is also provided for in the Bill. I hope the Bill will work effectively and satisfactorily. I realise there is an ongoing debate whether all employment should be unionised. All employment organisations must contain groups which represent employees and employers or a potentially dangerous situation could develop involving regular hiccups which could result in loss of revenue, employment or productivity.</P>
      <P>I do not want to proceed further as I know other Members want to participate in the debate. The framework for the Bill in general is positive. There is considerable room for improvement, however, and I hope there will be an opportunity for this. I do not know what timescale the Minister of State has in mind, but my colleagues will be anxious to know whether ample time will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be ample time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine. When finalising the drafting of amendments, it would be helpful to use our experience in the House over recent years to build a template against which the various abrasive edges that have caused problems in the past may be picked off with a view to ensuring we do not repeat our mistakes in the future.</P>
      <P>That is all I wish to say. I hope the Bill does the job it was intended to do. Legislation has often been introduced in the past from all sides of the House on foot of great debate, inspiration and aspiration. How often we have been saddened to see that it does not rise to meet the great expectations expressed in the beginning. I hope that does not apply in this case. It is an area that is becoming increasingly important because of the sensitivities that exist within a rapidly changing workforce. I hope that this will at least be a positive step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who introduced Second Stage two days ago in his absence.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome in that it gives an opportunity to debate the important issues encompassed by it. Its aim, as the Minister of State said in his opening statement, is to transpose into Irish law an EU directive of the year 2002. It is both long overdue and disappointing in its scope and content. Ireland models itself on an economy built on partnership. That is the image we present across the world to the effect that there is co-operation within the economy between its pillars &mdash; workers, employers, the agricultural sector and the social pillar &mdash; which work together in an environment of mutual support and respect to everybody&rsquo;s gain. That is the model we have presented, certainly to the new developing countries and the new EU member states, as the recipe for economic progress. It is a model that is now under severe attack.</P><Col N="926"/>
      <P>The debates in this House over several weeks regarding Irish Ferries indicate the most pointed and savage underscoring of the attack on the whole concept of social partnership. A maverick company such as Irish Ferries is seen by others as a trojan horse to undermine social partnership and, to borrow the phrase of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s, to engage in a race to the bottom. A view was expressed that because this maverick behaviour was confined to the maritime sector, it was difficult to deal with because it was happening offshore, so to speak, and outside the scope and remit of Irish domestic law. This refers to a labour law regime that has been built up, particularly since our membership of the European Economic Community in the 1970s. Its most important pillars were put in place by a dynamic Minister for Labour, Deputy Michael O&rsquo;Leary, during the 1970s who bedded down many of the fundamental rights that have been expanded in the following decades. That corpus of labour law is now under attack and not alone in the maritime sector.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I reject any notion that we cannot deal with the maritime sector. The Labour Party has this week produced a Bill requiring those companies who wish to reflag vessels to do so in jurisdictions with which they have real connections and not simply pick a country just to avail of a labour law or funding regime that is entirely inappropriate and undermines the employment regime that has been built up in Ireland over decades. There are mechanisms to deal with such situations and I hope that the rhetoric we have heard from Government, not least from the Taoiseach, will transpose itself into firm action. If this maverick company is allowed to get away with it, we will not have a maritime sector with an Irish employee within a few months. There certainly will be knock-on consequences for the rest of the economy as well.</P>
      <P>How will it knock on to the rest of the economy? It has already been brought to my attention that EU citizens have every right and entitlement to work in Ireland but many are being employed on a minimum wage and are willing to work overtime at a flat rate. That is causing major difficulties and much resentment within a labour force that has agreed negotiated wage rates for particular jobs and an expectation that work carried out after the standard 39-hour week will be remunerated at an enhanced level of pay.</P>
      <P>If these issues are not dealt with upfront and clearly, we are going to attract incipient racism. The murmurs exist already to the effect that it is not an issue of employers exploiting employees but rather non-nationals somehow undermining wage rates and the terms and conditions of employment of Irish workers. It is a serious juncture and the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, has a critical role to play in addressing this issue directly, robustly and immediately.</P><Col N="927"/>
      <P>This is not the appropriate time to deal with this matter as I only have half an hour to speak specifically on this piece of legislation, but I hope there will be a further and fuller debate on these matters. The type of society we have in this country will be defined very shortly by this if we do not deal with these issues robustly and clearly to preserve in legislation the terms and conditions that workers have won over the years. It should be ensured that those who work in the economy from other EU member states and beyond where work permits have been allocated do so in line with the terms, conditions and rates negotiated and receive the premium payments agreed with the trade unions.</P>
      <P>It is of great concern that the terms of the Employment Permits Bill, which we will deal with separately in due course, unfortunately mentions only a requirement to pay the minimum wage. There is almost an indication that non-nationals working in this economy should be paid the minimum rate only. It is an issue that we must come to grips with and that the Government, if it really believes in the ideal of social partnership and wants to vindicate and defend the rights of workers and the gains made by the trade union movement over the years, will have to act upon with some alacrity. I fear, however, the rhetoric we have heard from the Taoiseach and others is merely that and that a liberalising Progressive Democrats mentality lies at the heart of the Government.</P>
      <P>This directive provides a unique opportunity to bed down real partnership. The basic principle of the legislation is to establish a general framework setting out minimum requirements for the right to information and, equally importantly, the right to consultation of employees. Ireland has an unenviable record of being the last of the 25 member states of the Union to legislate for this directive. This comes as no surprise to me from a Government that sees itself as being closer to Boston than Berlin. At least significant sections of the Government do, although I am not sure of the position of the Minister of State present in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>His proximity to Shannon may give him that view. That shorthand phrase means they are closer to the concept where workers&rsquo; rights are not as well regarded. The jury is out on the view of this Minister of State and I welcome his involvement in the debate. When we deal with the minutiae of this and of the Work Permits Bill on Committee Stage, we will find out where he stands.</P>
      <P>The deadline for transposing this important workers&rsquo; rights directive into law passed on 23 March 2005. Uniquely among all the member states, we have failed in our obligation to do that because the Government attached no great <Col N="928"/>urgency to it. When the Bill was published, I described it as unwanted and unloved by the Government. Its publication was accompanied by none of the usual fanfare that we associate with the publication of significant legislation. Why was that the case? After all the time it has taken for the Government to publish domestic legislation, all we have is a minimalist and grudging adoption into Irish law of the 2002 directive. Unfortunately, the Government has taken the opportunity to weaken and to emasculate the ground breaking innovative provisions of the directive. The Government has watered down the directive as much as possible and I can give a few examples of this. It is availing of the option to phase in the directive over three years so that it will be well into 2008 before the legislation comes into effect in workplaces with 50 or more employees. Workers in smaller enterprises may never receive the full benefits of this legislation. The Government is attempting to avoid worker representation as a statutory right, by providing for so-called direct information and consultation. What does that mean? Does the information consist of mail shots and e-mails? Is that the sort of consultation that will be used as a substitute for real dialogue and negotiation between employees&rsquo; representatives and management? This is an American solution to a European situation and it is inappropriate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Workers must opt into the system of information and consultation by signing up, in writing, at least 10% of the workforce, rather than automatically including the provision as a right. This is very problematic. In companies such as Ryanair, members were threatened with being fired if they joined a union. How likely is it in those circumstances that a critical mass of 10% of a company&rsquo;s workers signs up and triggers those rights? The Minister of State has a duty to ensure that it happens as of right. Protection against victimisation for asserting rights is weak in the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposals. On Committee Stage, we will have a chance to deal with the specifics of this and I hope he will listen to some of the proposals submitted by the Opposition for strengthening the protection against victimisation. The standard rules for the employees&rsquo; forum provide for only two meetings per annum with the employer. That hardly represents a permanent, on-going process of consultation and information envisaged by the 2002 directive. The Labour Party will fight to strengthen this legislation on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A literal reading of the directive might lead some to the view that machinery could be <i>ad-hoc</i>, that is, information and consultation would take place only as particular issues arose, rather than as part of a process of partnership and dialogue. A more positive view is that the establishment of a permanent process of consultation and information is implicit in the provisions of the directive. A permanent machinery could be established, such as a form of the works councils. This model is tried and practised in continental <Col N="929"/>Europe and it is the norm in German manufacturing. A two tier system exists, with management and a board of directors on one tier, along with the next tier that is an on-going dialogue between the partners in a company. These partners, consisting of workers&rsquo; representatives and management, evaluate the needs of the company and the future of the company. It is not the old fashioned Victorian model of employer, manager and worker, whereby the worker receives instructions on occasions and is told what to do. We want to give workers in our dynamic economy a stake in their own undertakings. That is the central core of the proposals in the original directive and it has not been grasped by the Government. It had a legal obligation since last March to transpose this into Irish law, but it felt like a burden.</P>
      <P>The response of IBEC has been very begrudging. IBEC did not see the directive as part of the next generation of the partnership that worked so well for Ireland. It could give people a stake in the company, a pride in the company, as well as a shared ownership in the company, so that they are not stunned by shock announcements, as is all too often the lot of workers in Ireland. Without warning, a company announces a particular set of difficulties that could well have been avoided had the workers been involved. If the workers had been alerted to the difficulties, they could have negotiated arrangements and got themselves out of those difficulties. That mind-set underscores the mind-set of the framers of this directive and I hoped it would have been robustly transposed into the legislation before us. There is a compelling case for partnership in information and a proper structured consultation process.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a wasted opportunity, although I may be convinced by the Minister of State&rsquo;s willingness to engage with the Opposition on Committee Stage and accept amendments. It wastes an opportunity that would not only be good for workers, but would be good for business and ultimately, for the Irish economy. Choices must be made about the future direction of Ireland&rsquo;s economic model. The Taoiseach talked about the concept of partnership and his role in framing it, but the Government now needs to act and to spell out its view of the future direction of the Irish economy. I agree with the view put forward by Mr. Keith Sisson of the industrial relations research unit of Warwick University in a paper that he produced in 2002 when this directive was being framed. The paper was entitled, &ldquo;The information and consultation directive: unnecessary &lsquo;regulation&rsquo; or an opportunity to promote partnership?&rdquo;. In an extremely interesting, well-thought out and well-researched paper, he put forward a clear set of presentations, making a compelling case for the most structured, formalised and far-reaching sharing of information and consultation possible between partners in every enterprise. At individual level he states:</P><Col N="930"/>
      <P LI="1">Both the dignity of the individual and the opportunity for personal development are involved &mdash; work, after all, is one of the biggest single influences on people&rsquo;s life experience. In ACAS&rsquo;s words [ACAS is a British agency] &ldquo;whatever the size or type of organisation, people need to talk to each other; they need to exchange views and ideas, issue and receive instructions, discuss problems and consider developments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Hence, this is good for the individual. He summarises the business case as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">Having to explain their positions, take criticism and admit errors is something that few managers find easy; a right to representation also changes the power relationship with employees. Yet the considerable benefits of having effective information and consultation arrangements far outweigh any disadvantages. Having to explain policies to employees obliges managers to allow time for a fuller consultation of the proposals than would otherwise be the case, helping to ensure that the wrong decisions are not rushed into. Moreover, effective information and consultation is a critical tool in obtain the input of employees &mdash; the scrutinising of proposals by employees can lead to alternative and better decisions. Typically, their knowledge and experience of the details of operations on the ground, the problems and pitfalls and how they might be dealt with, is often far superior to that of management. These details, after all, are their job.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Hence, there is a business case for consultation and provision of information. Mr. Sisson also puts forward a case for the good of information consultation for society in general. He states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The UK Government also stands to benefit a great deal from effective information and consultation arrangements, with the prospects of achieving several of its key policy objectives being considerably enhanced. For example, such arrangements could go a long way towards reducing the soaring costs of the employment tribunal system &mdash; remedying the lack of adequate workplace procedures for handling disciplinary cases, which is one of the biggest reasons behind the resort to litigation. Similarly, it might be expected that such arrangements would give a much-needed boost to improving the UK&rsquo;s training record and achieving a better work-life balance, both of which the Government has committed itself to.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These are all commitments to which our Government could sign up and which could give our society a boost. Hence, there is a compelling case to embrace this wholeheartedly. It is surprising that the employers&rsquo; approach to it, as represented by IBEC, has been relatively grudging and that the Government&rsquo;s response in framing this proposed legislation is considerably weaker than it might have been. The information and consul<Col N="931"/>tation directive is one which benefits all sectors of the economy and all individual players within it.</P>
      <P>Clearly, Members will require some considerable time to address the specifics of the Bill on Committee Stage. The Minister of State has indicated that he has been open to accommodating suggestions from the Opposition and elsewhere. I have read the Seanad debate in some detail and have noted that not all the suggestions came from Opposition Members. If one considers the Minister of State&rsquo;s Second Stage contribution in this House, he described most of the amendments that he accepted as minor and, unfortunately, that has been the case. When this House gets into the nitty-gritty details of the legislation on Committee Stage, I hope the Minister of State will have an open mind in respect of the Opposition&rsquo;s suggestions.</P>
      <P>It is stated continually that if one strengthens workers&rsquo; rights, one is somehow placing a burden of red tape on industry or small employers. While a case can be made that this is sometimes true, it cannot be made in this instance. The requirements for consultation and information constitute a win-win situation for all parties in the partnership of the workplace. As I have stated, if information is shared in an open way and criticism received to and from both employers and workers, if there is open dialogue as to how the enterprise is faring, whether its stakeholders are pulling their weight and what must be done, inevitably this will lead to a better solution for all.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, some contributions in the Seanad from employers such as Senators White and Quinn, who have long experience of being employers, lauded the notion of dialogue on a structured, open and consistent basis as one of the key elements to a successful enterprise. Their sensible comments should be heeded in that respect.</P>
      <P>An opportunity still exists to fashion this Bill into a new pillar of partnership, in order to signal the direction which the House intends the economy to take to all the players in the labour market. We are at an important juncture within our industrial relations framework, with what some describe as full employment, although employment black spots still exist. Moreover, an enormous new workforce of eager migrant workers is available. Members must ensure and this House must make clear that workplace gains achieved through the trade union movement and through decades of negotiation will be protected in the future. I refer to gains in respect of health and safety, hours of work, fair and proper remuneration, negotiated sectoral deals within various sectors of the economy and premium rates for overtime employment. This legislation will become one element in framing the type and shape of labour market desired by Members and, ultimately, in forging the type and shape of economy and society that we will leave to the next generation.</P><Col N="932"/>
      <P>We want both our economy and its stakeholders to prosper without any element of exploitation. For that to happen, as legislators, Members have a clear and unanswerable responsibility to frame the strongest, most robust and best legislation possible.</P>

	<P>This Bill transposes into law the provisions of the European Union directive on the establishment of a general framework for informing and consulting employees within the European Community. While the Government had committed itself to transposing this directive by March 2005, delays in transposing directives are nothing new. The greater concern in respect of the transposition of this directive into legislation is that it is not faithful to the spirit of that directive. In essence, that is at the core of my concerns.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the House at the beginning of this debate, the Minister of State spoke of the extensive consultation which took place in respect of this legislation with the social partners, including the unions and employers&rsquo; representatives. While he did not state whose views impacted most strongly upon the Government in drafting the legislation, this is easily discernible. The influence of the employers, or perhaps more accurately the anti-union employers who oppose any form of collective action by workers, is clear throughout the text. The Bill reflects the antagonism of American multinational corporations in particular towards dealing with workers as a collective body.</P>
      <P>Before addressing the detail of the Bill, I place on record Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s demand that a stand-alone Department of labour affairs be established to decouple labour affairs from enterprise, as there is a conflict of between the two areas. There is also increasing evidence that some civil servants in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are hostile to proposals to improve workers&rsquo; rights. A good example of this conflict arises from the treatment of freelance workers by the Competition Authority, which comes under the Department&rsquo;s aegis. The Department refuses to change the definition of employee to address the plight of this group of workers and prevent them from being targeted by the Competition Authority. This is a clear illustration of the conflict which can arise from having labour affairs subsumed into a Department whose primary focus is on enterprise.</P>
      <P>Workers&rsquo; representatives have expressed serious concern and disappointment regarding this legislation. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for example, has described it as &ldquo;untenable in its current form&rdquo; on the basis that the <Col N="933"/>Government has adopted a minimalist approach to the information and consultation directive, namely, that advocated by employers. Trade unions have pointed out that the Bill in its current form will do nothing to aid workplace consultation or representation.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister spoke of the partnership process, no commitment to real partnership is evident in the legislation. It appears odd to speak of partnership at a time when the displacement of workers through outsourcing and recruitment of underpaid migrant labour is developing into a prominent feature of the labour market and companies such as Irish Ferries and Doyle Concrete, to name but two, are tearing up recommendations issued by the Labour Court. The fact legislation is required to oblige employers to inform and consult their workers on matters of relevance to them is indicative of the failure of employers to embrace the supposed spirit of partnership. It is also a vivid illustration of the fact that social partnership, as implemented in this State, has not sought or achieved any real change in employer attitudes towards workers and trade unions. Despite years of workers making major sacrifices in terms of delivering industrial peace, many employers still maintain an inherent hostility to unions and collective negotiations.</P>
      <P>It is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position that workers must have the right to form and join trade unions, negotiate contracts of employment and picket and withhold their labour and that employers must recognise trade unions. If the Government and others were genuinely committed to having workers and employers work together, they would support the position that trade union recognition is necessary. Nothing in this Bill obliges companies to deal with trade unions. We need legislation to require companies to recognise organised labour. In non-unionised workplaces this legislation, as currently formulated, will have no impact. It should provide for collective consultation only.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, pointed out that the directive &ldquo;leaves considerable discretion to member states in setting out national procedures&rdquo;. While this may be the case, serious questions are being asked and I am sure legal opinion will be sought on the basis of the real concern that the legislation is not true to the spirit of the directive. Given that issues regarding the process of selecting the employee representative were raised with the Minister of State on Committee Stage in the Seanad, he should be well aware of concerns that the legislation as framed would allow the employer undue influence on the selection of the employee representative. This is an undemocratic provision which would seriously hinder the effectiveness of the legislation. The Bill should not permit the appointment of a representative and the procedure should be confined to selection by an electoral process.</P><Col N="934"/>
      <P>It is essential the legislation does not allow employers to cherry-pick employee representatives on the basis of who they believe they can control. Sinn F&eacute;in will seek to delete the definition of what constitutes an appointment. Section 1 states:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">&ldquo;appointed&rdquo; means, in the absence of an election, appointed by employees, or appointed by the employer on a basis agreed with employees;</P>
      <P FLI="0">This definition is unacceptable and I challenge the Minister to reveal the extent to which he was lobbied by business representatives to have it included. Did the American Chamber of Commerce, for example, lobby for this provision which effectively allows employers to control the entire process of information and consultation?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Serious concerns have also been raised regarding section 7 and amendments have been sought to ensure employees in an undertaking which meets the employee thresholds, as defined by section 4, have an automatic right to information and consultation and that the employer would be required to enter into negotiations on arrangements for information and consultation. This provision will be important if the Bill is to make any real difference to workers. A range of other issues of concern arise from the legislation but time constraints prevent me from addressing them now. I look forward to discussing them on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. As Deputies have noted, its purpose is to transpose an EU directive into Irish law and, as usual, we are late in doing so. Having read the text of the legislation and followed its passage through the Seanad, it is clear the Government has opted to do the bare minimum in fulfilling its obligation to transpose the directive. It is a pity it did not take the opportunity to expand the scope of the legislation to address various other areas which are currently creating serious difficulties for workers here and across the European Union.</P>
      <P>The services directive forms the backdrop to the legislation and the current industrial relations climate in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union. As Deputies are aware, the directive was first proposed and later withdrawn for review. The motivation behind it is to allow wages and conditions to be undermined in the member states. If implemented in its current form, the directive would, for instance, allow employers established in eastern European member states to operate in Ireland on the basis of wages and conditions pertaining in their country of origin. EU Commissioners, including the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, have expressed support for the directive. In expressing his outright support for it recently, Mr. McCreevy demonstrated he is opposed to basic and fundamental conditions of employment for workers in EU <Col N="935"/>member states. He publicly supported such a situation in Sweden, where a Latvian company wanted to employ people on the basis of Latvian pay and conditions. When he was taken to task on that, he spoke in the European Parliament to say that he certainly did not apologise and that he supported that view. Unfortunately, we see that in this country too. The situation with Irish Ferries has brought this to a head. IBEC supports Irish Ferries in its attempt to sack 543 Irish workers and employ foreign nationals at ridiculous rates. In recent days, it has been supported by the Irish Exporters&rsquo; Association. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment also supported that recently when it allowed exactly the same situation to arise on the French route with the <i>MV Normandy</i>. It subsidised redundancies on that route to the tune of &euro;5 million.</P>
      <P>This situation goes to the very heart of Irish society. It simply must be stopped, since if it is not, it will destroy the wages and conditions that have been fought for and won over many years here. It may well also cause this country to become a hotbed of racism because of such action by Irish Ferries and the fact that non-national workers are employed here in most cases on the minimum wage but not under the same conditions of employment as Irish workers. Effectively, non-national workers are being used and abused by employers, and that will lead to the perception that they are taking the jobs of Irish workers. We do not want that to arise in future. If allowed to develop, it would certainly allow scope for the worst type of racism to rear its ugly head.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the threshold of 50 employees for enterprises and companies to come within the ambit of this Bill is far too high. I do not see why someone working in a company with fewer than 50 employees is not entitled to the same information and so on as someone employed by a larger company. The vast majority of non-national employees and workers from other European Union countries work in enterprises with less than 50 staff. The terms of this Bill, as far as I can see, will not apply to them at all. The opportunity should have been taken to ensure through the Bill a legal right to trade union recognition. There is no doubt that it is very important, and even more so nowadays in the context of the services directive and the way that some companies, such as Irish Ferries, want to undermine the trade union movement and Irish workers, effectively destroying the core values that we have built up.</P>
      <P>The opportunity presented by this legislation should have been taken to deal with flags of convenience. I know the Taoiseach has told us that he does not believe that anything can legally be done on the issue, but that is not the case, since, if the political will were there, a way would be found to ensure that they were outlawed. I note the Bill introduced by the Labour Party this week <Col N="936"/>in that regard. If the political will were there, the Government, together with Irish representatives at EU level, could make such flags of convenience illegal. That which is proposed at Irish Ferries would then be completely unlawful. There is no doubt that what we have seen there will destroy the social and economic conditions and values of Irish workers and the Irish people if allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that there is a background to this legislation of American multinationals&rsquo; preference for not dealing with organised labour. There is no doubt that many such companies will deal only with the individual worker and not with organised trade unions or staff associations. However, there are American multinationals here that have no difficulty dealing with trade unions. I commend Merck, Sharpe and Dohme (Ireland) Limited, which has had a plant at Ballydine near Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency for almost 30 years and always dealt with the trades unions. There is an excellent relationship between management, unions and workforce on that site.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to believe that, with the requisite will, management of such multinationals could not co-operate, recognise and talk to organised labour by way of the Irish trade union movement. That is one of the reasons I believe the legal right to trade union recognition should be embodied in this Bill. I do not believe, for instance, that American multinational companies who, to date, have refused to deal with organised labour or trade unions, will co-operate with this Bill either, unless they are forced to do so. There should be an automatic right for workers to access the information dealt with in this Bill, and that process should be ongoing. It would be better if it were dealt with through the organised trade union movement here in the shape of ICTU and its affiliates.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the legislation as far as it goes, there are other areas that should be dealt with as I have outlined, and it is a pity that an opportunity to do so has been lost. I hope some of those issues might be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the chance to speak on Second Stage of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill 2005, and commend the Minister both on bringing it forward and on the manner in which he has done so. I know it is late, and that it is easy for the Opposition once again to portray Ireland as terrible. We are one of the last two countries in the European Union to bring this directive into effect. That is not a mortal sin in this case compared to some of the other delays that occurred but it is important in terms of one aspect, not because of the European regulations but for our own management of businesses here. I refer to companies that may have been looking to introduce something like this or perhaps our unions or <Col N="937"/>workers looking for it. The inability to proceed in that regard because of the absence of legislation is something we regret. It is unfortunate we were not the first out of the traps, not because it concerns European regulations but because it is the right way to proceed.</P>
      <P>My sense of why it is the right way to proceed was confirmed recently in an article in a science magazine which concerned getting an estimate on something that is difficult to judge or assess. Science is increasingly showing that if a large group of people, even those who may not necessarily have an expertise in a particular subject, were asked to give the weight of an object, for example, or to respond on something about which they might not have specific knowledge, there is an interesting scientific phenomenon that if the responses are aggregated, by some strange law that scientists do not yet understand, that process uncannily leads to a close to correct assessment of what the weight is or whatever factor is being sought.</P>
      <P>There is something such as collective consciousness which we are wise to listen and adhere to, and I believe that works in companies to the company&rsquo;s benefit. If companies are informing their workforce they are opening up the nature of the business and the discussions within the business as wide as possible to hear views from the postal worker or office post boy, a position I held myself at one time in a business, to the chief executive. Widespread access to knowledge information in terms of what the business is doing is an empowering action for business. As a former employer I embrace this legislation because it will be progressive and good for Irish business.</P>
      <P>To expand on the example, we operate here in a Chamber of 166 Members and we know that on the occasions when we work well, and it does not often work here, and when there is proper debate with people listening to each other, it benefits the work we do when we critically analyse, comment and suggest to each other how things should work. We know, therefore, that this access to information is the right way to go.</P>
      <P>I have a concern in that regard that the Government, in the implementation of the directive, is not going far enough and embracing the legislation in that sense. While I commend the Minister on the consultation process he outlined in his contribution, the manner of the debate in the Seanad and the amendments that arose from that debate, I have a slight concern about much of the legislation we are bringing through the House, which relates to the partnership process. While we may be engaging in a process where there is open consultation, the real decision making will be done, as the Minister of State appeared to imply in his speech, in a series of bilateral meetings that will occur with two of the main players in the process, ICTU and IBEC. While I have nothing but admiration for both those organisations and the people working in them, drafting legislation on the basis of a nego<Col N="938"/>tiating deal between IBEC and ICTU is not the right way to proceed. I am not sure it leads to the best legislation or process. In other legislation an incredibly cautious approach was taken because one side or the other did not want the current system changed or any radical change. I was not party to the negotiations but I fear that may have been the case here because the cautious, narrow way in which the Minister of State is implementing the directive is probably due to a cautious narrow approach on the part of those two agencies, particularly IBEC in this case, whose whole purpose is often maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>. That is probably what their members were happy with but it is not necessarily looking to the future in terms of developments and new businesses. That is a concern of mine.</P>
      <P>A particular concern I have about the Bill is the inability of an employee to have a right to engage in this process in terms of open consultation and access to information. The provision whereby 10% of employees collectively must request to enter such a process is a mistake. I would prefer employees to have the right to opt in to start this process. If the Minister were to heed what those of us on this side of the House are saying about the benefit of collective discussion and open access to information, he would strengthen the provisions in this case and allow for greater access. That is a better interpretation of the directive and one that would benefit Irish employees.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Morgan who spoke earlier about the need for the separation of labour and enterprise. Good enterprise favours proper labour policy and proper labour policy benefits proper enterprise policy. I do not see it as a case of converging interests and needs. They are in some cases but a strengthening of the Bill in that regard would be to the benefit of all sides.</P>
      <P>I have been unable to check this in the European directive but will the Minister of State confirm, perhaps at the end of the Second Stage debate, whether we could set a threshold of fewer than 50 employees of a company? What we define in this country as a small company is often very different to what it would be in Germany, France, America and other very large jurisdictions. As a former employer with less than ten full-time employees, I did not consider that a small company. Once we got beyond one or two employees I felt we were developing into a reasonably sized business. There may be a case, and I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s answer, to apply it to employees in this country because a company with over 25 employees is a reasonably sized company. Why should we not look to offer the same benefits and opportunities to companies of that size as we would to a company with 50 or more employees?</P>
      <P>I regret the cautious approach in terms of implementing the Bill. There appears to be a staggered approach in terms of the provisions for companies with up to 150 employees which will <Col N="939"/>come into effect immediately. The provisions for companies with fewer than 100 employees will come into effect later and it will be as late as March 2008 for companies with 50 to 100 employees. I do not understand the reason for the slow implementation of this process. I would prefer to see it apply to companies of different sizes.</P>
      <P>I support the nature and content of the Bill but the Minister should consider being more ambitious. I imagine he will hear from Members on all sides of this House that this is not a measure we should be concerned or cautious about. It will be a positive development for Irish businesses and in implementing it, I ask the Minister of State to go further than he did in his contribution and provide for some of the changes I have outlined for the good of Irish employees but also for the good of Irish business.</P>

	<P>This Bill comes to us from Europe and is part of a suite of workers&rsquo; rights legislation. As we can see from the guidelines regarding Irish Ferries, workers&rsquo; rights must be enforced and constantly updated. We need to be able to deal with new issues as they arise and while we have solid protection measures in place for employees, there will always be a minority of employers who will try to find a way around issues such as the minimum wage. We must be vigilant and protect against such practices. We must lead the way on this issue and support workers of all nationalities as best we can by ensuring they enjoy the benefits of the minimum wage and the protections afforded by trade union membership. The greatest investment any company makes is in its employees. Successful companies work in partnership with their employees in a spirit of transparency and collective thinking.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries re-flagged one of its ships, the <i>MV Normandy</i>, at the start of this year. That ship now sails under the flag of the Bahamas. This action was part of an effort to avail of low-cost contract staff. The company received a heavy subsidy from the State when redundancies were made in the past and this seems to have been the go-ahead for what is now taking place. The majority of staff on the <i>MV Normandy</i> is from Eastern Europe. It is unacceptable that workers&rsquo; rights should be exploited in this way. Many members of the staff at Irish Ferries have been with the company for decades while the employees from Eastern Europe have far shorter tenures. The former are free to apply for voluntary redundancy under the terms offered but the issue is the management shift in the company from a permanent to a casual staff. Through its actions, Irish Ferries can reduce its wage costs by 50% in pursuit of the bottom line of profitability.</P>
      <P>It is the case, however, that Irish Ferries worked within the law in the actions it took. I urge the Minister to lead the way in fighting against this type of behaviour. I am not sure what <Col N="940"/>he can do because we operate in a system of free trade. It is important, however, that for any similar company with its head office in the State, there should be a law to deal decisively with issues such as security of tenure for workers. As an island nation, we are dependent on sea and air transport. It is critically important that we promote business in terms of the level of imports and exports. The responsibility is with the Minister to ensure there is transparency and that there is information on the number of staff on the payroll of such companies and the benefits they receive. We must work with our European partners to stop companies operating in EU seas when involved in these practices. EU law must be changed to protect workers and there is no reason that Ireland cannot lead the way in this fight.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Bill is to be welcomed. Its provisions will emphasise the Government&rsquo;s role in protecting jobs. The high-cost economy which is influenced by stealth taxes and the stacked up costs affecting every business, impacts strongly on our competitiveness. The high cost of fixed charges is one of the reasons that many companies will utilise an option within the law to cut costs in regard to employees. The workforce is the backbone of the economy and we must ensure employees enjoy the respect and support they need.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, employers must provide information and consultation on issues they could previously have kept private from their employees. Such issues include the probable development of a firm&rsquo;s activities, the structure of future employment in the business and any decisions likely to lead to major changes in work organisation or contracts. The Bill also obliges employers to provide enough information to enable worker representatives to make adequate preparations for consultation. Good business is all about consultation with staff and such an approach makes good economic sense.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the inclusion of penalties in the legislation, according to which employers will face fines of up to &euro;30,000 for breaches of the law. As is the case with all Bills, the legislation is pointless if it does not contain penalties that will deter employers from not adhering to it. It is, however, unfortunate that the Bill does not legislate for companies that employ less than 50 people. This is a major mistake because the backbone of our successful economy consists of small companies which employ less than ten people. The definition of a small or medium enterprise in Ireland is considerably different to what is understood in other European states. A company with 50 employees might be considered very small elsewhere in Europe but constitutes a sizeable enterprise here. The Minister of State might respond in regard to the definition of an SME.</P>
      <P>That the legislation does not apply for companies with less then 50 employees represents a major cop-out. In every town and county, companies mostly employ less than 50 people. There <Col N="941"/>is no doubt that small firms have a particular need to be protected from over-regulation. They are the backbone of many communities which do not enjoy investment from large corporations. The Government must endeavour to protect them at all costs because they have driven the economy. We must ensure, however, that workers in small firms are not treated as inferior to their counterparts in large companies. People should not be treated with less respect or afforded fewer rights simply because their employer has fewer staff than a major multinational. It is a question of equality of access and services.</P>
      <P>Another major fault of the legislation, which represents a transposition of an EU directive into Irish law, is the amount of time it took to come before the House. The process of consultation began three years ago and the deadline for submissions from interested parties was September 2003. The original target date for the enactment was March 2005 but it is now November. While I am not in favour of legislation being rushed through, neither do I support a situation where legislation takes three years to come before the House. It is far too long, particularly in the context of employee protection. When a need becomes apparent for legislation, we must endeavour to work quickly to fill the gap.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these concerns, I support the Bill. It is very much needed to enshrine employees&rsquo; rights. I am sure my colleagues will put down amendments on Committee Stage. I seek assurance from the Ministers that we will see action on the issues of Irish Ferries and the re-flagging of ships. Ireland must take a lead on this issue. We have witnessed first-hand that re-flagging of ships is wrong and should not be allowed. We must now meet our European partners to discuss in depth the issue, which will have a significant impact. It cannot be put on the back burner and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The protection of employees is vital to the growth of the economy, which has been facilitated in large part by small firms in every village and town. Small acorns have grown into a large oak. The tourism sector, in particular, comprising hotels, restaurants and the providers of other critical services, has been driven by small companies whose employees work passionately, often seven days a week. It is important that eastern European staff in the catering sector should enjoy the protection of the minimum wage and the other benefits enjoyed by Irish workers. It is vital that they receive the benefits of this legislation. They are here to make a living and the new law in regard to work permits will facilitate them.</P>
      <P>It was reported in the newspapers during the week that up to 150,000 people from eastern Europe are working in Ireland. It is important that they are welcomed. They play a critical role in the growth of the economy and I have no doubt they will add considerably to Ireland&rsquo;s status as a tourist destination. The growth in our economy owes much to the services sector and <Col N="942"/>we must ensure it continues to thrive. Small companies will continue to prosper as the backbone of the successful economy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in 2004 to proceed, as financial resources permit, with the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited undertook an in-depth preparatory process, which included engaging with the major governing bodies of sport and stakeholders, and drew up proposals for the development of the sports campus in a series of phases. Phase 1 of the development control plan proposes the development of pitches and ancillary accommodation catering mainly for rugby, soccer and Gaelic games, the sports which engage the greatest number of people in Ireland. In addition, an indoor sports centre is planned, to cater for a range of indoor sports with spectator accommodation and publicly accessible all-weather floodlit synthetic pitches are also included.</P>
        <P>The Government had an initial discussion on the proposal last September and requested that further analysis be carried out by the Office of Public Works in connection with the delivery of the project. I have reported to my Cabinet colleagues on the outcome of this additional analysis which will be factored into consideration of the Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006-10 to be published on budget day.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful that there will be a positive outcome and, in that eventuality, it is my intention <Col N="943"/>to establish a statutory agency to oversee the Abbotstown project. I am conscious of the need to have top class sports facilities in place in good time to create opportunities which would promote Ireland as a location for foreign teams wishing to avail of training for the London Olympics in 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Whereas I am pleased with the Minister&rsquo;s reply to some extent, I am somewhat disappointed that provision was not made in today&rsquo;s Estimates for the sports campus development. However, the Minister has indicated provision for it will be made in the budget and I look forward to such an announcement.</P>
        <P>I stress the importance of this facility for Irish sport. It is vital that it is provided to ensure Irish sport can compete at international level. It is also critical for so many of our young athletes so as to develop their talents to compete internationally for Ireland. This would be a centre for excellence, an academy for sport and cover all the main national outdoor sports.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that moneys will be provided in the budget? Will he give an indication of when work will commence on the campus? How long will it take to develop the campus? It is important it starts in time so that Irish and international Olympic teams can avail of its facilities for the 2012 games in London.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s Estimates relate only to current expenditure. It is anticipated that capital projects will be announced later. Some work needs to be done on the Abbotstown campus proposal. We would have to enter into arrangements for funding over four years for phase 1 of the programme. It will be decided in the current discussions with the Minister for Finance on the capital provision for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited was asked to prepare a list of priorities on the construction of the sports campus for consideration. The company did so and those proposals have been presented in the usual manner to the Minister for Finance. We must await announcements by the Minister for Finance on the capital budget provision. I expect that will be done either before or during the budget speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>My predecessor, Deputy O&rsquo;Shea, and I fully support the establishment of such a sports facility. Given the costs that will be incurred to send a team to the Beijing Olympic Games, the real aim of all sporting disciplines will be the 2012 games in London. Not since 1948, have we had a better opportunity to send teams to the games. London has a similar climate to Ireland&rsquo;s climate which will also be helpful to an Irish team. However, we will want the team prepared to the highest level of excellence. The proposed sports <Col N="944"/>campus gives us the ideal opportunity to achieve this.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that the funding for phase 1 will come over four years. Has it been decided what phase 1 and the subsequent phases will involve? This will play a large role for the different disciplines in their planning for the 2012 games. Will the Minister give a timeframe of what will be available to our sportsmen and sportswomen? The team being sent to London will possibly be the largest Olympic team in our lifetimes. It offers a wonderful opportunity to us to have the strongest team too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">All else being equal, phase 1 will proceed and will involve a four-year period, but it may be a five-year cycle. The plan for phase 1 would provide pitches and ancillary facilities catering for the three major field games, rugby, soccer and Gaelic games. It would also include an indoor sports centre to cater for a range of indoor sports with spectator accommodation, as well as shared core facilities such as accommodation and fitness gyms. Publicly accessible all-weather floodlit synthetic pitches are also included.</P>
        <P>Other developments, including an arena and headquarters for major governing sporting bodies and so forth have been left for consideration in future phases. Provided that phase 1 is completed in the proposed timeframe, a future government may enter into phase 2. I have always acknowledged the support of Deputies Deenihan and Wall for the sports campus project. I anticipate, irrespective of what might happen in an election, we will see a necklace of event centres which would ultimately give to the nation a campus suitable for all types of major international competitions. Sport in Ireland has grown. In 1997, we spent &euro;17 million on sport while today&rsquo;s Estimates show a spend of &euro;155 million. If we are to take advantage of the 2012 London Olympics, it is crucial phase 1 is delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe a realistic start will be made on the sports campus in 2006? Will the Minister give a commitment or a strong indication that money will be provided for this development in the budget? The Minister mentioned a necklace of facilities, and I ask him his plans for regional facilities throughout Ireland. It is one thing to have a campus in Abbotstown but another to look after young athletes in different regions. Is there a plan, parallel to the campus development, for the rest of the country? There has been much talk of an institute of sport in this country, but does this proposal incorporate the development of such an institute, which has been proposed by previous Ministers and others?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s last question, there is no provision in the first phase of the proposed Abbotstown project for an<?oasys _jy?><Col N="945"/><?oasys _fc?>institute of sport. The Irish Sports Council is compiling a proposal for an institute of sport for presentation to Government. That proposal is at an advanced stage and I expect to receive it soon.</P>
        <P>With regard to the construction of regional facilities across the country, Deputy Deenihan is aware of a number of such facilities, not least in his constituency. In Castleisland, for example, An R&iacute;ocht has a fine athletics centre. Other such centres for different sports are evident throughout the country. There is no parallel formalised plan for the construction of regional sports centres across the country. I have concentrated my energy on whether it is first possible to initiate the first phase of the Abbotstown project. Future consideration should be given to the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to congratulate again my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on the agreement he concluded with the US authorities last week in the context of the current EU-US negotiations on open skies. This is great news for, and has been generally welcomed by, the Irish tourism industry, which will be a huge winner when the anticipated new and additional gateways in the United States are opened up.</P>
        <P>The US market is our second largest tourism market, delivering close to 1 million visitors annually and generating a revenue spend of approximately &euro;700 million. United States visitors stay longer, spend more<i> per capita</i> and travel more widely in the country, which is critically important for improved regional spread of tourism. The proposed new arrangements have major potential to open up a range of new air services between Ireland and the United States. According to some tourism industry sources, this agreement gives Ireland the potential to double the number of US visitors by 2012 to 2 million and should add each year an extra 150,000 visitors and &euro;100 million in revenue to the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Market research carried out in the United States by the tourism State agencies in recent years has demonstrated a consistently high level of interest in Ireland as a holiday destination and a high level of unsatisfied demand due to the very limited number of direct access gateways and routes between Ireland and the USA. I am pleased that under the proposed agreement, Irish carriers will have access to three additional gateways from November 2006. I am also pleased that the need for a transition phase for Shannon has been recognised. I believe this breakthrough agreement represents a major opportunity for Ireland as a whole and it is imperative that the <Col N="946"/>industry and public sector in the west, in particular, work together in a positive and integrated way to realise the great potential on offer. For my part, I will ask the tourism State agencies to take the necessary measures and work with the industry to capitalise on the very significant opportunities arising from Friday&rsquo;s announcement.</P>
        <P>The Ireland-US bilateral agreement made sense at the time it was negotiated. Now, however, we must move on and grasp the opportunities for all regions, including the south west, arising from such a large potential tourism market that is well disposed to the Irish product offering. The conclusion of such an agreement has long been an objective of Irish tourism policy and was a major recommendation in the report of the tourism policy review group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, published in September 2003.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the agreement worked out between the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and the US Secretary of Transport will have a detrimental effect on tourism in the west, the mid-west and, in particular, the south-west region? What measures does the Government intend to take to ensure that Shannon Airport retains a high level of aviation business? What guarantees, if any, can be provided to ensure tourist numbers are not affected in those areas?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the phase-out of the stopover flies directly in the face of Government commitments to balanced regional development? Does he agree with the view of SIGNAL, which represents workers at Shannon Airport, that 40,000 jobs both directly and indirectly in the tourist sector could be placed in danger as a consequence of drawing more business and tourist flights to the east coast?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all heard these dire warnings for some time. They are not representative of the general air of optimism for the future that is more evident in the Shannon region, especially in terms of maximising the potential of Shannon Airport. The airport has already this year reported a 36% growth in traffic and stated it is on target to deliver an additional 1 million passengers this year.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, last Friday stated that this deal was hard won and gives Shannon Airport a good opportunity to prepare for the arrival of open skies. It also provides Aer Lingus with an opportunity to fly to three new destinations from 2006. This will enable the company to develop its transatlantic route structure in the approach to open skies, open new markets for Irish tourism, offer greater choice to consumers and facilitate the growth of jobs in Ireland. The Minister also announced proposals to prepare an economic and tourist development plan in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and me to <Col N="947"/>ensure Shannon Airport sustains and grows transatlantic air services. I look forward to working with these Ministers on this plan.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that three additional gateways can be opened for Irish carriers next year. The Minister for Transport has stated that these points will be nominated by Irish authorities and there will be flexibility to change these cities during the transitional period. Market research carried out in the United States by the tourism State agencies has demonstrated a consistently high level of interest in Ireland as a holiday destination, and a high level of unsatisfied demand due to the limited number of direct access gateways and routes between Ireland and the USA.</P>
        <P>It is sometimes forgotten that the bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the United States of America was a double-edged sword. Our national carrier was restricted to five gateway cities in the United States of America under the terms of the deal. Our national airline was accordingly prohibited from flying out of other gateway cities in the US. This was clearly to the detriment of the airline&rsquo;s business and the tourism business in Ireland. I accept the stopover had a beneficial use in its time. However, times have changed and there are now greater degrees of access to the country and far more carriers are entering Ireland. There are far more opportunities for Shannon than there were at the time of the stopover&rsquo;s introduction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As I advised the House previously, in January 2004 the Government agreed to provide funding to the joint IRFU and FAI project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium. The facility will be a 50,000 all-seated stadium to be built on the grounds of the existing stadium at Lansdowne Road and will meet all the current international standards for rugby and soccer.</P>
        <P>The Lansdowne Road stadium development company has been formed and is the contracting party for the development and management of the new Lansdowne Road stadium. Over the past year and a half, the company has been working to a very challenging timescale and I note with satisfaction that all targets of the project schedule so far have been met. A formal legal agreement has been signed between the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the IRFU and the FAI with regard to the procurement of the project. A steering group, with representatives of the IRFU, the FAI, the OPW and the Departments of Finance and Arts, Sport and Tourism, under the <Col N="948"/>chair of the Secretary General of the Department is overseeing the delivery of the project.</P>
        <P>In April 2005, following a tender competition, the design and project management teams for the stadium were contracted. Following their appointment, work on developing the conceptual design got under way and I was very pleased to launch the new detailed design for the project on Monday, 17 October 2005. The new design has been created in consultation with the different stakeholder groups that will be involved in and impacted on by the stadium. As a result, in order to minimise the impact on residents living in close proximity to the new structure, the design, which is at four levels on the east, west and south sides, sweeps down to a single level at the north end. The revised detailed design is an innovative solution that provides a better stadium facility incorporating significantly more corporate and premium seats.</P>
        <P>The detailed design for the project has been costed at &euro;365 million. The House will recall that the Government&rsquo;s commitment was to provide a maximum of &euro;191 million towards the project with the balance being provided jointly by the IRFU and FAI. This commitment has been reiterated and is accepted and understood by both the IRFU and the FAI. Both sporting organisations have indicated they can meet the additional cost from increased income streams from forward selling of the additional seats.</P>
        <P>Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company is currently preparing the application for planning permission. It is intended that this stage will be completed within the next month. By the end of 2005, the planning application will be ready for lodgment. Lansdowne Stadium Development Company has adopted a very open and listening approach to the concerns of local residents who are understandably concerned about the changes planned for the existing stadium grounds. In this context, the project is geared to meet the requirements of the planning process. At this stage, it is not realistically possible to establish with certainty the length of time that will be required to complete the process. Working on the assumption that there will be no untold delay, construction work will commence in early 2007. Construction is scheduled to take 29 months and, on this basis, the end of 2009 could see completion of the redeveloped stadium, which will cater for the international fixtures of the IRFU and the FAI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and his invitation to both Deputy Wall and I to the launch of the Lansdowne Road project, of which we were supportive. In light of the recent fire on the northern terrace, does the Minister agree the stadium is on borrowed time and could be described as an aging stadium? In reality, there is only one stand &mdash; the east &mdash; as the west stand and both terraces require substantial overhauls, hence the urgency of sustaining <Col N="949"/>momentum. In light of what happened at Lansdowne Road last week, it may be an opportune time to approach Croke Park in order to negotiate the possibility of holding future soccer home internationals there. Perhaps the Minister could influence that decision at this time.</P>
        <P>The Minister launched the project and has studied the design. Will he confirm that he would consider the design to be sympathetic to the constraints of the site and reflective of local residents&rsquo; concerns? It is obvious that, when the stadium will eventually get planning permission, an appeal will be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which could go even further. In anticipation of this, does the Minister believe it to be a good idea to establish an umbrella group composed of the various stakeholders and residents to examine problems in order that the planning process can be expedited and no delays will occur on the planning decision for this important national project? Will the Minister inform the House of the contributions of the IRFU and FAI in respect of the increased estimate for the stadium?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The IRFU has met with the residents of the areas around Lansdowne Road a number of times, who are well aware of the development proposals. A consultative forum with an independent chairman, Mr. Dermot Egan, has been established through Dublin City Council to act as a channel through which the residents&rsquo; anxieties and fears can be made known, dealt with and resolved where possible. In order to minimise the impact on those residents living in close proximity to the new structure, the design is at four levels on three sides and one on a fourth.</P>
        <P>The Lansdowne Road development will be subject to the rigours of the planning process and the rights of all those affected by it will be protected. We have engaged in so far as was possible with the residents through the IRFU and other means. At this point, a new stadium with world class facilities that looks magnificent and has been praised by leading environmentalists, such as Mr. Frank McDonald, is far more preferable to a concrete jungle, which might be the alternative were the stadium to move out of Lansdowne Road. I encourage residents to consider this very carefully. It is a democracy and people are entitled to do as they wish. Deputy Deenihan knows that there is very little he or I could do about it.</P>
        <P>In respect of the cost of the stadium, the IRFU and FAI will share the balance of the cost between them. I cannot recall the exact proportion. The State&rsquo;s contribution will be &euro;191 million and the entire cost will be &euro;365 million. I am assured by both the FAI and IRFU that they are confident and quite positive that they will be in positions to raise the necessary funds through advance selling of various premium and corporate seats.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>When the relocation of UCD from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield began in the 1950s, the expectation was that the site and premises at Earlsfort Terrace would transfer to the State as progress with the development of Belfield enabled Earlsfort Terrace to be vacated. Against this background, Government decisions in 1974 and 1981 to convert a portion of the building for use as a National Concert Hall were widely perceived as being the first step in the phased development of a performance complex at Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
        <P>The opening of the NCH addressed a long perceived gap in the cultural infrastructure of the city for a venue suitable for classical music performance. Its location in an historic building with an imposing fa&ccedil;ade, well known to Dubliners and to generations of graduates countrywide, also contributed to its appeal. However, it was evident from the outset that the space allocated was cramped and inadequate, especially from the perspective of stage dimensions and backstage accommodation.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these limitations, the NCH is highly regarded internationally by performers. It has broadened its cultural remit and now embraces traditional and popular music alike, serving the needs of patrons across all strata of society. That said, the seating layout and quality of the NCH is basic. Increasingly stringent health and safety and other legal requirements, including requirements coming on stream in respect of open access for disabled persons, are also proving to be problematic. These shortcomings cannot adequately be addressed within existing space constraints.</P>
        <P>As the arrangements being made by the UCD authorities to relocate all remaining Departments and personnel from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield are at an advanced stage, the university has signalled its preference to have the Earlsfort Terrace site placed at the disposal of the State subject to satisfactory terms being agreed. In turn, my preferred option is to utilise this site for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall. Officials in my Department and the Office of <Col N="951"/>Public Works have met several times with the university authorities to advance negotiations for the acquisition of the site. However, I will not be in a position to bring these negotiations to finality until I have secured Government approval for my plans for the redevelopment of the concert hall, which are currently before the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>In the meantime and in anticipation of the availability of the Earlsfort Terrace site to the State in the near future, the OPW commissioned a feasibility study on how best to adapt the site and buildings to accommodate a state-of-the-art concert hall. An imaginative outline proposal to reconfigure the existing building to create a three hall performance space has emerged from this study. The key elements of the proposal are a new concert hall incorporating a main auditorium with a seating capacity for 2,000 patrons and meeting the requirement for open disabled access, the existing auditorium to be preserved for use as a rehearsal, general purpose and technical recording-broadcast space and a flexible smaller hall with a seating capacity of 500, enabling smaller concerts to proceed simultaneously with performances in the main concert hall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response. Does he agree it is critical that the State moves as soon as possible to acquire the facilities from UCD? I understand the UCD authorities are very anxious to move the medical and engineering faculties to Belfield as soon as possible and they await direction from the State. I remind the Minister that if the State had acquired some of the property beside the Abbey Theatre, there would not now be a need to move the theatre to another site. The Minister has the support of all Members of the House for the acquisition of the extra space to ensure that the National Concert Hall can accommodate existing demand.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister will be aware the concert hall is often overbooked for performances. Certain international performers would come to Dublin if the concert hall had suitable space. The backstage facilities in particular are inadequate. This is an urgent matter. UCD is anxious to move out and is prepared to facilitate the State in this respect because of the national significance of the proposal. I appeal to the Minister and the Government not to procrastinate and to bring this opportunity to fruition as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything Deputy Deenihan has said. While an excellent case can be made for the redevelopment of the hall, the Government must have regard to priorities when it comes to sanctioning substantive spending. In that context we are making the best possible case on behalf of the concert hall.</P>
        <P>There are two costs involved: the cost of the site and the cost of the redevelopment of the <Col N="952"/>building. These costs will both require Exchequer funding. Site cost valuation by UCD is in excess of &euro;42 million and the building costs are estimated at &euro;135 million with the total cost estimated at approximately &euro;177 million.</P>
        <P>The construction of a new auditorium with a capacity for up to 2,000 patrons, together with a smaller, flexible configuration of a recital auditorium with a capacity for up to 400 patrons, is proposed. It is envisaged events could take place simultaneously in both. The existing auditorium would be refurbished to be used by the National Symphony Orchestra for rehearsals and performances. Its current capacity of 1,200 seats would reduce to approximately 900 seats. However, it is not possible to confirm whether a three hall configuration would be adopted in the final analysis. It would be a matter of closely examining the financial costs and yield associated with such a proposal.</P>
        <P>The proposed project is still at the feasibility stage and no architectural drawings have been made to date. It is important and interesting to note that the Office of Public Works is of the view that the project is not really suitable for a public private partnership arrangement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>This will depend upon the planners and architects and how they intend to proceed with the project. It would be possible to proceed in stages. Every effort will be made to ensure the concert hall can be used. In answer to Deputy Deenihan, the cost of the site is estimated by UCD to be in excess of &euro;42 million.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Officials from my Department have recently met officials from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland to discuss a number of issues common to both Departments including pursuing opportunities for all-island co-operation in the development of the horse and greyhound racing sectors.</P>
        <P>A number of difficulties have been identified by officials with regard to an all-island approach <Col N="953"/>to racing. For instance, responsibility for horse racing spans across a number of Departments in Northern Ireland and there is no central Government role or funding system for greyhound racing there.</P>
        <P>Officials will continue to explore the issues involved with their Northern Ireland counterparts to explore the potential for all-island co-ordination in the development of the horse and greyhound racing sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is one area in which an all-island body could be justified, it is the area of greyhound racing. Those who support greyhound racing in Northern Ireland come from both communities. It is one sport that attracts universal support from both communities. I am confident the Minister agrees with me on the great potential that exists for an all Ireland greyhound racing body.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that the recent blueprint for development of the sector to 2010 published by the British greyhound racing board does not refer to Northern Ireland? No one is looking after the interests of greyhound racing in Northern Ireland which has only one greyhound racing track, situated in the Brandywell, and which is closed. It is very unfair to the patrons of greyhound racing in Northern Ireland. They do not have the facilities such as are enjoyed in Dundalk and Lifford.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate if there is any possibility that the Republic of Ireland, through the greyhound board, could assist in the development of greyhound racing in Northern Ireland by using the arrangements in place under the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Deenihan is correct. Investment in the greyhound industry in the North of Ireland has been quite paltry. I understand no funding has been provided to tracks except for a once-off payment in 2001-2002 of &euro;280,000.</P>
        <P>Bord na gCon believes there is merit in considering a 32-county approach to greyhound racing and it is well positioned to extend its regulatory responsibility to the North. However, to date the industry in Northern Ireland has not received any financial support of any note or any at all, from the off-course bookmakers&rsquo; market or from central Government funding. Bord na gCon considers it is crucial that the matter of funding of the sport in Northern Ireland be addressed prior to any determination on allocating responsibilities to an all-Ireland greyhound racing authority. Legislative changes would be required and the scope of the 1958 and subsequent Acts would need to be amended to reflect any change in scope and responsibilities.</P>
        <P>I recently met Mr. Hanson, the Minister from the North. We discussed horse racing and greyhound racing but it became clear in the course of those discussions that there really is no clear cen<Col N="954"/>tral government role relating to greyhound racing in the North. In those circumstances it was agreed that officials of both Departments would consider how best to proceed and this is occurring as we speak.</P>
        <P>There are obviously difficulties in bringing forward proposals for what is, in the final analysis, another jurisdiction. All we can do is try to see if we can reach a level of co-operation which would see us assisting in so far as we could the industry in the North of Ireland. Currently, 15% of prize money is won by northern greyhounds, which gives an indication of the level of activity here by greyhounds from the North of Ireland and perhaps also an indication of their quality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In case we do not revisit this issue for some time, if the Northern Ireland Assembly is re-established would the Minister for the remainder of his time in office establish the investigation and putting in place of the type of body that would benefit racing in all parts of the country as a new priority?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the many areas which could usefully be addressed by a new executive and assembly in the North of Ireland. It is merely one of numerous examples of how the fact there is no assembly and executive in the North is inhibiting development on a cross-Border basis across several socio-economic sectors, one of which is the greyhound industry. My dearest wish is that we would be in a position to discuss with a minister from the executive in the North how we could co-operate and move on in terms of developing the industry on an all-island basis, not seeking any territorial advantage, dominance or anything like that but merely as a matter of commonsense. We have seen that kind of co-operation deliver tremendously well in the tourism sector, another area of my brief, through Tourism Ireland. Unfortunately, until the executive and assembly are up and running again in the North of Ireland it will be difficult to progress projects such as the greyhound industry. This affects several other sectors as well. No doubt co-operation North and South in several fields and sectors is more than desirable as has been illustrated repeatedly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 28 together.</P>
        <P>I recently met with David Hanson MP, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure for discussions on a number of sports issues, including the opportunities arising from London hosting the 2012 Summer Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.</P>
        <P>The selection of London last July as the host city for the 2012 games offers Ireland an unprecedented opportunity for business, tourism and sport. Minister Hanson and I agreed there were tremendous opportunities for both Northern Ireland and the Republic to benefit from the games. The existing close working relationships which exist, both at departmental and sports council levels, will provide a solid basis upon which to maximise the opportunities ahead.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly many of the participating countries will be seeking to locate their competing athletes for pre-tournament training in places in close proximity to the United Kingdom and I have been advised by the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland that a number of countries have already inquired about the possibility of using Ireland as a base in the lead up to the London games. The attraction of Ireland to overseas teams participating in the games for acclimatisation and preparation purposes is an area on which the Irish Sports Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland could co-operate.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has invested in excess of &euro;700 million in Irish sport. Of this amount, approximately &euro;500 million has been spent on the development of sporting facilities at a national, regional and local level. A significant proportion of this investment has gone towards developing a network of top class facilities around the country designed to meet the training, coaching and competition needs of our elite competitors in a wide spectrum of sports.</P>
        <P>Among the major projects which have been supported are the Croke Park stadium, the National Aquatic Centre, the National Rowing Centre at Inniscarra, the national tennis centre, <Col N="956"/>the National Boxing Stadium, the National Hockey Stadium at UCD and the National Coaching and Training Centre at the University of Limerick, which complements the wide range of top quality facilities provided at the university many of which have been used by international sportspersons. In addition, the early delivery of a sports campus at Abbotstown, which is being considered by the Government for funding in the context of the multiannual capital investment framework for 2006-10, would be a key element to Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to attract competing athletes to locate here.</P>
        <P>With an estimated 1 million additional visitors to Athens for the 2004 Olympics, Ireland will be hoping to attract substantial additional visitors around the 2012 games with significant benefits for the tourism industry. Both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be considering how best to tap into the potential tourism spin-off from the Olympic Games in London in 2012. Ease of access to London from an increasing number of airports on the island will be an important factor in exploiting the tourism dimension of the games.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The successful hosting of the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003 greatly enhanced Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and credibility on the world stage as a safe and welcoming destination. This very positive experience is one on which we can very usefully build in planning how we might optimise the tourism opportunities of the Olympic Games in 2012. To give added impetus to the drive to capitalise on the sporting and tourism opportunities of the London Olympic Games, I intend to establish an interagency group to support the work of the agencies already working in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. On the opportunities he expressed when the International Olympic Committee announced London as the venue for the 2012 games, following these discussions he had with the Northern Minister are concrete proposals on the verge of being made on joint approaches, not only on how sporting organisations and countries taking part in the Olympic Games might use facilities on this island but also on a more common approach to tourism through the existing all-island bodies?</P>
        <P>He mentioned in his reply that the Irish Sports Council has already received a number of inquiries about the possibility of locating training camps in this country in advance of the 2012 Olympic Games. Could he provide more concrete detail on the number of such countries that have made inquiries? Is his Department and the Irish Sports Council targeting a number of countries that might be prepared to be based here?</P>
        <P>On the question of the Paralympic Games, the Minister cited the example of the Special Olympic Games but they are different types of games. Ireland already has a proud record of participating and being successful in the Paralympic Games. Does the Minister see a particular role in <Col N="957"/>such Irish experience in terms of achieving a cross-over for the benefit of the Paralympic Games that will also be held in London in 2012?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been no concrete agreements yet on precisely how we might co-operate on the 2012 Olympic Games. The meeting which I had with Minister Hanson was purely preliminary. We discussed generalities and no concrete proposal came from the meeting other than the fact that we agreed that co-operation was of pivotal importance. In that respect, it also was noted that there is a considerable number of facilities in this jurisdiction which might be utilised in the context of the 2012 games.</P>
        <P>Since there are no definitive proposals or inquiries, it would clearly be remiss of me to seek to give any indication as to who was looking for accommodation or facilities. If we are to attract teams from abroad, the construction of the first phase at Abbotstown would be of immense importance. If our facilities are sufficient, athletes will be attracted here. We have a number of top class facilities which can be utilised but the first phase of the campus would be a considerable addition to those.</P>
        <P>Our proximity to London is well documented. Indeed, some have suggested that it would be easier to get from Dublin to London than from Manchester to London during the course of the games and I believe that is true. Co-operation will continue and officials from my Department will enter into discussions with their counterparts in the North with a view to coming forward with concrete proposals on co-operation. This will be to the mutual benefit of each jurisdiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a possibility of a cross-over with the Paralympic Games?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>That possibility exists. We will certainly pursue it to the best of our ability. I acknowledge that Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s suggestion is a good one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The existence of our national games means we have many sports facilities available around the country. Our national games are not included in the Olympic Games. Is it possible, through the work of the Irish Sports Council or the interagency group the Minister is to set up, that negotiations will take place with the GAA with a view to using some of its facilities? If they were used, there would be a much wider choice of facilities available to foreign teams and they would not have to base themselves around the capital only. Given our regional airports and infrastructure, we could provide wider scope for availing of tourism opportunities on foot of the games.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland should put together a package with the Irish Sports Council in this regard as early as possible. Given that we are receiving queries now, it is obvious that national teams are <Col N="958"/>making travel plans well in advance of the games. They are making plans not for the upcoming games but the games thereafter so as to obtain the best facilities. This trend presents us with an ideal opportunity.</P>
        <P>How soon will the interagency group be set up and how much scope will it have? It will obviously include the tourism agencies and sports agencies, such as the Irish Sports Council. Will local authorities and sports organisations be represented or will it just be a case of the Irish Sports Council representing the sports organisations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my intention to establish, in the very near future, a wide-ranging group that will seek to ensure that Ireland capitalises as much as possible on London&rsquo;s hosting of the Olympic Games in 2012. The group should obviously comprise people in the tourism industry and the sports sector. It is appropriate that it comprise officials from my Department also. We will, in the very near future, give full consideration to how rounded the group should be.</P>
        <P>On the question of Croke Park, to which Deputy Deenihan referred in a different context, and the possibility of our making the grounds available to visiting teams, the GAA, in its special congress meeting to discuss the question of the stadium being made available to the IRFU and the FAI, which are representative bodies of two other sports, made a decision that related only to the period of construction of the new stadium at Lansdowne Road. The resolution that was passed was quite specific and I must respect it. If the grounds are to be used by sports organisations other than the GAA beyond the period in which the new stadium at Lansdowne Road is being constructed, it appears there is a need for a new resolution at congress. While this can be pursued within the GAA, it has not been promised &mdash; that is a question for another day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe it would be wise to have an audit of our existing facilities to determine whether they meet international training requirements and to determine the number that would be suitable? Having done so, he could, through the International Olympic Committee, inform the various teams that will be participating in the Olympic Games in London of the availability of our facilities. Would this be a practical way to proceed? The national coaching centre in Limerick has received a number of inquiries in this regard, including on the day following the announcement that London was to host the games.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that many teams participating in the Olympic Games prefer not to stay in the host country if at all possible because of all the hype involved. They prefer somewhere quieter. There is almost no doubt but that we will attract some teams to this country.</P><Col N="959"/>
        <P>An audit of our sports facilities is commencing and it should be completed in two or three years. The interagency group that I intend to establish can also examine facilities with a view to drawing up a list of those that would be suitable. There are many suitable facilities in the country.</P>

        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that, following approval by the Government, I announced yesterday that Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium is being invited to become the provisional preferred tenderer for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin. The decision was taken by the national conference centre steering group following a detailed assessment and evaluation of tenders received against award criteria set out in the Invitation to Negotiate document.</P>
        <P>I understand that, in accordance with the competition process, the next step will be for the contracting authority, the Office of Public Works, to negotiate, settle and agree any required amendments to the project agreement with the provisional preferred tenderer and for the provisional preferred tenderer to resolve all outstanding due diligence issues. Assuming that these negotiations prove successful, the next step will be the appointment of the provisional preferred tenderer as preferred tenderer. During the preferred tenderer phase, the preferred tenderer will develop and provide the full range of project documents which will require review and approval by the contracting authority.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that a further critical stage in the process of delivering a world-class national conference centre for Dublin has been completed and I look forward to the early completion of the next stages and to a final decision by the Government next year. I am particularly pleased that the commitment in the programme for Government to provide a national conference centre has taken this further major step towards final implementation.</P><Col N="960"/>
        <P>On the basis of consultations undertaken by my Department and research reviewed, I am totally convinced of the need for a modern, dedicated national conference centre if Ireland is to realise its full potential in the very valuable international conference market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement. I am sure the Minister will agree that the existence of a national conference centre would add approximately &euro;60 million to the Irish economy and create and support approximately 3,000 jobs. Will he be more specific regarding the provisional preferred tenderer? Might it transpire that negotiations will break down between the Government and the provisional preferred tenderer such that the latter might not be accepted by the Government? Will the Minister confirm that the tenderer has complied with all the procurement guidelines? Is there a question of any guideline not being adhered to? If the provisional preferred tenderer becomes the preferred or accepted tenderer, what timeframe does the Minister envisage before the start-up of this important facility for the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Of necessity, this has been a complex and difficult procedure. The tenderers underwent a rigorous examination and evaluation by the steering group, which was obliged to make a decision as to the preferred tenderer to go before Government for its decision. Issues had to be examined in detail. The current status is that the contracting party, the Office of Public Works, will enter into discussions with the provisional preferred tenderer to finalise negotiations.</P>
        <P>I prefer to look at this matter in a positive light. The project has been mooted for many years. In a sense, we have read most of the chapters of the book and have now reached the last chapter. We will read and perhaps re-read the last chapter but, in the final analysis, within a period of approximately six to nine months the final preferred tenderer can be identified. It should then be possible to go to the Government with a view to designating the preferred tenderer. One can foresee all kinds of obstacles, of which there have been many in the provision of a national conference centre, but as we have passed the penultimate stage, I am confident that we can successfully conclude negotiations and have the conference centre built.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, tourism was identified in the Good Friday Agreement as an area of co-operation. With the establishment of Tourism Ireland as a North-South body responsible for marketing the island <Col N="961"/>of Ireland overseas, we now have a shining example of the tangible benefits to be achieved from closer, more structured collaboration on this island.</P>
        <P>I have just returned from a tourism promotional visit to London where I attended the Irish stand at the world travel market. I addressed a major reception organised by Tourism Ireland for the trade and media attending this prestigious exhibition. This event brings into very sharp focus the level and intensity of the competition in the global tourism market and I pay tribute to the professionalism of Tourism Ireland which, once again, mounted an Irish stand which was simply top class and captured the very best of what this island has to offer the international visitor.</P>
        <P>In December, I will participate at the official launch of a new suite of advertising and promotional materials for Tourism Brand Ireland. This event will be the culmination of many months work by Tourism Ireland in researching and developing a new destination campaign for Ireland&rsquo;s overseas markets, which seeks to further tap the potential of our key tourism markets. I am confident that this new campaign will build on the two previous incarnations of Tourism Brand Ireland and will assist in delivering the ambitious targets for tourism growth set in the New Horizons report.</P>
        <P>North-South co-operation on tourism exists on a less formal basis in areas such as education and training, product marketing and publicity, tourism statistics and research, e-business and e-marketing and accommodation standards. A variety of initiatives are being developed and pursued by the tourism agencies across these areas to deepen the level of co-operation that already exists. In October last, I launched two significant cross-Border tourism initiatives which would be of particular interest to the Deputy, the Destination North West and Glens and Lakelands projects. These projects are being supported to the tune of more than &euro;2 million in EU and Exchequer funds, including funding from the three tourism agencies on the island. These initiatives will aim to highlight the incredible variety of the tourism product available in the north west. They also represent a significant achievement in terms of cross-Border co-operation as they bring together a diverse group of <?oasys _ch?>organisations, including North West Tourism, Derry City Council and Fermanagh District Council, as well as Causeway Coast Regional Tourist Organisation.</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have long recognised the value and basic common sense behind all-island co-operation in this sector. Through their actions, they have consistently demonstrated a deep commitment to the all-island approach. Significant work is under way to<?oasys _jy?><Col N="962"/><?oasys _fc?>develop an all-island e-marketing strategy which will ensure that the ever-increasing number of visitors who use the Internet to make their holiday plans can tap into all the information they need on the island of Ireland via one website. The three agencies are working closely on this initiative which I expect will come to fruition early in 2006.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will know, access is a key driver of tourism growth and I am glad that the promotion of City of Derry Airport is supported by a cross-Border grouping which includes F&aacute;ilte Ireland, NITB, Derry City Council and Donegal County Council. A key focus of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s work is to act as strategic partner to, and engage in co-operative marketing programmes with, air and sea carriers. It has intensified this work in 2005 and is actively working with carriers and airports to maximise awareness of existing routes and secure additional route developments. It is also working closely with regional airports, North and South, to ensure we achieve the best possible regional spread when carriers are considering introducing new routes and services. What is encouraging in this regard is that there are now some 42 flights coming into City of Derry Airport each week from five different UK airports.</P>
        <P>These are just some examples of the variety of North-South initiatives under way to develop tourism on this island. At this point, the all-island approach to tourism development is simply an integral part of the way the agencies operate. For my part, I am fully committed to the development of North-South co-operation at all levels and I am ready to support any new opportunities that may emerge in this regard in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I agree that Tourism Ireland is making a genuine effort to bring tourism to every part of this island and to generate co-operation between North and South. Nevertheless, does the Minister agree that there is an imbalance between the number of tourists who visit the areas south and north of a line from Dublin to Galway, favouring the area south of that line?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that for a number of years significant investment has been made in accommodation for tourists? Tax incentives have been utilised and hotels have been built in many areas, which is welcome. One can now travel to any part of Ireland and stay in a comfortable hotel. However, I am concerned with the condition of major tourists attractions, particularly in the north west, such as the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and, in County Donegal, Glenveagh, the Glebe Gallery and Dunfanaghy Workhouse. Many of these attractions have been operating for a number of years and are in urgent need of upgrading to European standards. Are schemes envisaged, like the tax concessions scheme for accommodation, <Col N="963"/>to enable us to bring these tourist attractions up to standard?</P>
        <P>Every region needs what I would call a flagship attraction that would attract 100,000 or more visitors per year, such as Seaworld in Dingle in the Minister&rsquo;s county. The north west needs a major attraction. Are there plans or incentives to develop such a centre?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister satisfied that one of the cross-Border groups, Waterways Ireland, is working to its full potential? It is responsible for an area of the tourism industry that has not been developed in line with developments in other European countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Waterways come under the remit of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. I am not up to date on developments in that area other than to say that it might be possible for Deputy Wall to table a question on waterways to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. Naturally, I would encourage as much co-operation as possible in this regard and agree with Deputy Wall about the potential of waterways.</P>
        <P>There have been many initiatives in recent years in the north east and north west. Under the tourism product development scheme some &euro;50 million was made available for the provision of attractions in areas outside traditional tourist areas, such as Killarney. In this respect, Donegal has done extremely well in that a number of projects in the county have been nominated. Of major importance in the North is the plan for a new visitor centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, which is one of only three world heritage sites on the island. I visited it recently and was very impressed by the design, which was launched by my Northern counterpart as Minister, Ms Angela Smith MP. The centre will be of enormous significance.</P>
        <P>The increasing business at City of Derry Airport is good news for access to the north-west and the north generally. This should be allied to the decision of Continental Airlines to fly into Belfast, the first time an American airline has operated a transatlantic route to Belfast. Continental Airlines states it is very happy with the amount of business achieved on that route.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGinley is correct that the northern part of the island is coming from a lower base. Owing to more than 30 years of the Troubles, it was close to impossible on occasion to get tourists to visit the North of Ireland. People have traditionally visited Donegal, which is and continues to be a popular destination. In the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland, however, it was extremely difficult. Nonetheless, there are encouraging signs. Last year there was an increase of 11% in the number of visitors coming to the North of Ireland. Admittedly the base is low, but there is no question that there has been a vast improve<Col N="964"/>ment. The co-operation arrangement I announced recently in the North with my Northern Ireland colleagues should be of tremendous benefit.</P>

	<P>The report referred to by the Deputy has just been brought to the attention of my Department, and I have now asked my officials to review it in the context of the deliberations on the possible framework for tourism product development, post 2006. It is widely acknowledged that one of the strategic challenges for Irish tourism over the next ten years, in the area of product development, lies in managing the natural and built environment in ways that maintain and enhance their attractiveness for the benefit of domestic and overseas visitors.</P>
        <P>Tourism is a sector that is firmly rooted in the natural and built environment and in the people and culture of Ireland. One of the key tourism objectives within An Agreed Programme for Government is to encourage the sensitive development of tourist areas and environmental best practice among providers. The demand for environmentally sustainable tourism development is one of the factors that influenced the work of the tourism policy review group and, therefore, the new strategy for tourism development now being rolled out by my Department, in consultation with the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>The September 2003 report of the tourism policy review group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, pointed out that there is widespread acceptance of the importance of good management and conservation practices in maintaining and enhancing the attractiveness of both the built and the natural environment. At the same time, rapid growth has resulted in other pressures on the environment, including congestion, inappropriate development in sensitive areas and waste management systems that are inconsistent with modern day standards and the green image of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The development strategy set out in the report provides a model to address interdepartmental issues relating to tourism development, including environmental sustainability. It complements a range of official work and participation in interdepartmental committees on environment-related issues. The nature of my Department&rsquo;s mandate is such that there are a number of important strategic results areas where it interacts with other Departments and agencies in order to <Col N="965"/>deliver on Government policy. One of the key cross-cutting issues is the pursuit of an environmental policy that accommodates the sensitive development and expansion of tourism with opportunities for the development of rural tourism and the enjoyment of natural resources for tourism, sport and recreation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is to investigate the report and obviously, this is something we can come back to at a later stage. The report highlights water pollution and waste as two features that will affect tourism. One is concerned with the number of fish kills that have occurred, the quality of water etc.</P>
        <P>As regards the beaches aspect, will the Minister say whether there is a concerted effort to ensure that we have as many blue flag beaches as possible? Is there some mechanism within his Department for checking this because that is one of the highlights of a region, especially for children, where a family has come to Ireland on holiday. It is essential that beaches are top quality.</P>
        <P>As regards waste, obviously the Tidy Towns competition has a major input. In the overall context, however, what plans has the Minister or his Department for improving the situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>All my Department can do as regards the issues raised by Deputy Wall is to encourage the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to control waste and ensure there are as many beaches as possible that qualify for blue flags. These are issues for that Department. Under the report, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, to which I have referred, various measures are proposed for assisting with the environment, which is recognised to be very important. In that respect the group has been in touch with various Departments in order to advance the 70 plus recommendations it has made.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, for being present. All Health Service Executive areas were instructed on Monday, 31 October, by the assistant national director of population health, Dr. Kevin Kelleher, to actively offer all poultry workers the &rsquo;flu vaccine as an urgent public health measure. The vaccine is to be available from GPs, who will be reimbursed by the HSE for supplying it free. HSE regions with high concentrations of poultry workers, such as in Cavan and Monaghan, have been instructed to consider establishing local clinics in high density poultry areas.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because I have learnt from people working in the poultry sector in my constituency that this scheme has not been rolled out. A request to a GP to avail of the vaccine was met with a response that it was not free of charge and would have to be paid for in full. I would like the Minister to clarify the situation on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children. How is the scheme being rolled out? This initiative has been taken primarily to prevent people being infected with the seasonal influenza virus and the avian &rsquo;flu virus at the same time. Such double infections can lead to mutations and could precipitate a &rsquo;flu pandemic affecting the human population on a wide scale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having been briefed by the Department of Health and Children on the dangers of an avian &rsquo;flu pandemic, I am certain that the recent and current widespread concern and media coverage was no false alarm. There is a real risk that the human population could yet be severely affected. The decision of the HSE to offer the vaccine free of charge to all poultry workers is therefore a welcome and essential public health measure. As I have stated, the comprehensive immunisation of those working in the poultry sector is essential to help prevent the development of a mutant virus that could then trigger a human &rsquo;flu pandemic. This can happen if someone attacked by the <Col N="967"/>human form of the virus contracts the avian variety at the same time.</P>
        <P>I have publicly urged all poultry workers to take up the vaccine as soon as possible. The HSE needs to ensure maximum publicity for this scheme and full accessibility. I want the Minister, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, to assure the House that this scheme is going ahead. How is it being rolled out? Have the HSE areas acted on the instruction of the assistant national director of population health? Have they publicised the scheme and have all GPs been informed?</P>
        <P>In my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, where a significant section of the poultry industry in this State is located, I have seen no evidence of this measure being implemented so far. The experience I have described strongly suggests that the wheels have not yet been set in motion. The end of November is approaching, and clearly winter has already set in. Can the Minister clarify the matter and assure the House that this essential measure is being put into operation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I am happy to have the opportunity to respond on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the administration of influenza vaccine.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that it has directed that all poultry workers should be actively offered this year&rsquo;s seasonal &rsquo;flu vaccine. This instruction issued to the HSE areas from the population health directorate on 31 October 2005. This is a public health measure and its purpose is to prevent the possibility of an individual being infected by both avian influenza and human influenza at the same time.</P>
        <P>Avian influenza is a highly infectious disease of birds that occasionally affects other animals and, while people can become infected, they rarely do. The view of the Department of Agriculture and Food is that the immediate risk of the disease being introduced into Ireland by migratory birds remains low. Although the avian H5Nl virus is highly pathogenic in human beings, all evidence to date indicates that it does not spread easily from birds to infect humans and human outbreaks have been short-lived. All the recorded human cases of H5Nl infections were associated with direct contact with infected poultry. There is currently no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission of avian influenza.</P>
        <P>The greatest concern for human health is that the avian H5Nl virus will remain endemic and that continued transmission of the virus to <Col N="968"/>humans and other animals will provide opportunities for human and avian viruses to exchange genes to produce a new virus that can replicate in humans and become highly pathogenic and easily transmissible between humans. In a human population with no pre-existing immunity, such a virus could trigger a global influenza pandemic. That is why it has been decided that poultry workers should receive the normal flu vaccine. Vaccination is being provided free of charge to the relevant individuals.</P>
        <P>Those defined as poultry workers include poultry flock owners and their families, poultry veterinary practitioners, poultry advisers, Department of Agriculture and Food veterinary inspectors and other personnel involved in outbreak control measures, laboratory personnel involved in poultry post mortems or poultry virology, catching teams, poultry transporters, carcass transport and rendering plant personnel, workers in the hang-on, stunning and plucking areas in slaughter plants, fieldsmen, vaccinators, selectors and so on, people involved in cleaning and disinfection of poultry houses or poultry transport, as well as personnel involved in litter removal and litter processing.</P>
        <P>Relevant staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food will be vaccinated by the Civil Service occupational health service. The HSE has advised that arrangements are under way to provide the vaccination. I am satisfied that the vaccination programme will be implemented in full. Vaccine supplies are available and particular focus is being placed on those counties with a high concentration of poultry farms, Cavan, Monaghan, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Extradition" RHead="Requests">
      <sTitle>Extradition Requests.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I am raising today is unusual. The extradition of two wanted men in the Czech Republic is being sought from this country. They are apparently fugitives from justice. They are wanted for crimes such as murder, kidnapping and torture in the Czech Republic. They are allegedly part of the largest criminal gang in that country and the Czech Government has contacted the Irish Government to seek their return. So far, we have been unable to grant their extradition or the request under the European arrest warrant. The two fugitives are apparently moving around in our country without hindrance. The problem seems to arise from the fact that both countries implemented the European arrest warrant at different times and in different ways. We implemented it in 2003 and made it retrospective and prospective, while the Czech authorities implemented it in 2004 and did not make it retrospective.</P>
        <P>It appears that there may be a difficulty in executing the arrest warrant because of the terms under which it was implemented, while the pre-European arrest warrant extradition legislation no longer applies. All member states of the Euro<Col N="969"/>pean Union implemented the arrest warrant legislation in different fashions and at different times. We implemented it here before the Czech Republic became a member of the EU. The new EU member states from eastern Europe would take a different approach to the situation because extradition would not have been applied in the old Soviet bloc. The end result is that an anomaly exists.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been the subject of requests for extradition or repatriation of these Czech nationals. We seem to have been unable to carry out those requests and I wonder what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform thinks about the situation. How does he intend to expedite the request? He should have a meeting with the Council of Ministers to see what other anomalies exist, because there is not much sense in introducing so-called standardised forms of legislation unless they function. We are wasting time in the Oireachtas going through the motions if the legislation cannot function between the different countries.</P>
        <P>We have enough murder and mayhem on the streets of our country. If we have it on good authority from the Czech police that there are two dangerous fugitives from the law of the Czech Republic, the Minister needs to examine the legislation to figure out whether we can deport undesirable non-nationals from this country. How do we close the European arrest warrant loophole? How do we deal with specific requests that have come to us about individuals who are fugitives from justice and seem to be able to operate here without hindrance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raises two distinct issues, namely, the action which the Minister proposes to take on specific extradition requests by the Czech Republic and the action he will take to close what the Deputy describes as a loophole in the operation of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. With regard to the first issue, neither the Minister nor the Department comment on any matter which may eventually come before the courts. To do otherwise could give rise to a danger of prejudice in such a case. As for the second issue, it may be helpful if I outline the manner in which the Czech Republic implemented legislation to give effect to the framework decision on the European arrest warrant. That legislation applies only to offences committed after 1 November 2004. Therefore, the issue relates to the procedures that apply to offences committed before the 1 November 2004.</P>
        <P>The terms of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant are important in understanding how the present position has arisen. Article 31 of the framework decision states that it replaces the existing extradition conventions, including the 1957 Council of Europe European Convention on Extradition. This means that the framework decision is now the basis for surrender between EU member states which have <Col N="970"/>implemented it. Article 32 of the framework decision establishes the general principle that surrender requests received after 1 January 2004 would be governed by the rules adopted by member states on the European arrest warrant. It also allowed member states the opportunity of declaring at the time of the adoption of the framework decision by the Council, on 7 August 2002, that they would only apply the framework decision to offences committed after a date they had specified.</P>
        <P>A total of three member states availed of this provision at the time of its adoption. The Czech Republic made a declaration at the time of its implementation of the framework decision, the effect of which purported to apply the European arrest warrant only to offences committed after 1 November 2004. That is not in compliance with the framework decision.</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 allows the Minister for Foreign Affairs to designate a member state that has, under its national law, given effect to the framework decision. Thus, the Czech Republic was designated on 25 January 2005 since it had at that stage adopted its legislation implementing the European arrest warrant. The effect of the designation of the Czech Republic was to cease the application of previous extradition arrangements to the Czech Republic from that date. A recent High Court decision highlights the difficulty which has arisen surrounding extradition to the Czech Republic. It is clear from that decision that any remedial action required is not for the Minister nor, indeed, for this State.</P>
        <P>The High Court decision in July, concerning a request from the Czech Republic for the extradition of a Czech national, decided that it was necessary for the Czech authorities to issue a European arrest warrant where an application for the arrest of a person, whose extradition is being sought, is made after the date that the Czech Republic became a designated state for the purpose of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. The relevant date here is 25 January 2005.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Therefore, following this High Court decision Ireland is unable to act on a request for extradition received from a member state of the European Union which has been designated for the purposes of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. The only exceptions arise in the case of three member states which had made appropriate declarations at the time the framework decision was adopted. In light of the decision, the Attorney General has advised the Minister that extradition arrangements between Ireland and the Czech Republic are now governed by the procedures contained in the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 and Ireland can only proceed to consider surrender requests on the basis of a European arrest warrant.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I do not suggest that we can sit back and do nothing, particularly where the difficulty which <Col N="971"/>has arisen could give rise to an inability on the part of either State to act against suspected offenders. To that end, the Minister, in response to a question from his Czech counterpart made prior to the High Court decision, had pointed out to him the effect of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 and the subsequent designation of the Czech Republic. He informed his counterpart that requests had to be made in conformity with the European Arrest Warrant Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following the High Court decision, the central authority for the European arrest warrant also wrote, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the Czech authorities setting out the implications of the decision. The Deputy will appreciate therefore, that the manner in which the Czech Republic has implemented the European arrest warrant means that if the offence occurred before a certain date, they will seek extradition under the Council of Europe convention, that is, effectively they will seek extradition under Part 2 of the Extradition Act 1965 and not by a European arrest warrant.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Attorney General has advised that it appears that the European Arrest Warrant Act does not permit the processing of a request for extradition received from a state which has been designated for the purposes of the Act except in the case of the member states which availed of the provisions of Article 32 at the time of the adoption of the framework decision. Therefore, the European Arrest Warrant Act does not permit the execution here of a request for extradition under the 1965 Act from the Czech Republic following the designation of the Czech Republic for the purposes of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. This was the clear decision of the High Court in the case to which I referred previously. The only way to proceed in such cases is for the Czech Republic to issue a European arrest warrant. If that presents a difficulty for the Czech authorities, it is a matter for them to resolve in their domestic legislative provisions.</P>
        <P>Therefore, it should be clear, that there is no loophole, as the Deputy suggests, in the European Arrest Warrant Act and accordingly it is not for the Minister or this State to take any action in this regard. I emphasise to the Deputy and the House that to do otherwise would be to breach our own obligations under the framework decision. No one would suggest that this would be the proper way to proceed. The central authority is in continuing contact with the appropriate Czech authorities about the matter.</P>

      <sTitle>Coroners Service.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I have had the privilege of being a Member for three and a half years and he has <Col N="972"/>been kind enough to assist me a number of times. This matter is by far the saddest and most profound that I have introduced to the House. I welcome the attendance of my friend and colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue. I know he will be sympathetic towards this case.</P>
        <P>This is the story of Pierce Nowlan, a young baby who was born in the Coombe Hospital prematurely on 14 October 2002. He had a medical condition which required a minor procedure and was taken to Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children where he died on his second birthday, 14 October 2004. As the Ceann Comhairle is probably aware, his parents Jean and Stephen, as well as his paternal grandmother Phyllis, are in the Visitors Gallery. I am sensitive about their attendance and I am sure he would want me to welcome them. I assure them of my thoughts and prayers as I know this is a difficult situation for them. They are members of my community, and I wish to highlight their concerns and sense of upset with regard to this matter as sensitively as possible. It is important to show solidarity with the family and to try to help them in their quest for what they perceive as the need for justice and the need to establish the truth as to what happened to their baby. I have had much contact with the family in the last year and am aware of the high level of upset within both the family and the general community in respect of this case.</P>
        <P>Many people will have seen the recent publicity highlighting the case in the media generally and particularly on television. The family gave a good interview on &ldquo;Ireland AM&rdquo; last Monday morning. The family members need assistance and ask the political system to help. They wanted me to note that they have met the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and were satisfied with the meeting. However, they want action. At present they are going through the coroner process. They want to know why they cannot establish the full truth as to what happened to their baby, why the surgeon&rsquo;s report in its fullest form has not been made available to them or to the coroner, and why there is a restriction on the number of witnesses who can be called by the coroner. They have told me that the coroner has been sympathetic in that regard and have reminded me that 23 people were present in the operating theatre in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, when their baby, Pierce, died. It is important that they gain access to the truth and to the information they seek.</P>
        <P>On a political note, I tabled Questions Nos. 474 and 475 on 15 November 2005 on the need to reform the Coroners Act 1962 rather than on this specific case. Similar questions were also tabled by colleagues from the Green Party and Fine Gael. The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism should convey a message to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy <Col N="973"/>McDowell, to the effect that there appears to be all-party support for a common approach to dealing with the business of the Coroners Act. I imagine the Minister, given his own experience, will understand that.</P>
        <P>At present, the family is trying to highlight the need to expedite the process by which the new legislation will be brought before the Cabinet and to expedite its enactment. The coroner&rsquo;s court will then be able to act under the new legislation to provide the family with the answers it wants. This issue differs from the matters I normally raise in the House and it is important to support the Nowlan family. In his statement, I hope the Minister can assure the family that this case is seen in the serious light it deserves. The family members have not highlighted this issue simply for their own sake. While they are anxious to establish the facts pertaining to their case so that, without forgetting Pierce, they can get on with their lives, they have also made the point that other families may be similarly affected. This has been a brave act for the family members, particularly for Stephen and Jean. They wish to prevent this from happening to any other family and that, whatever about the trauma of losing a baby, this particular aspect will be cleared up. I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s courtesy and thank him for providing me with this opportunity in the presence of the Nowlan family. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who had a prior engagement this afternoon and on whose behalf I wish to apologise. I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Connor for raising this matter and I join him in welcoming the Nowlan family to the House.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor will be aware that in response to Questions Nos. 474 and 475 of 15 November 2005, the Minister stated the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">The report of the working group on the review of the coroner service published in December 2000 recommended a comprehensive overhaul and modernisation of the coroner service in Ireland, with regard to the legislation governing the work of coroners, the support services available to coroners and the structural organisation of the coroner service. In keeping with the commitment in the Government legislative programme, announced by the Chief Whip on 27 September 2005, detailed proposals providing for that comprehensive reform are currently being finalised in [the] Department [of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.]</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Minister expects to be in a position to submit them to the Government before the end of the year. He has personally outlined this position to the parents of Pierce Nowlan. An inquest by the <Col N="974"/>Dublin City Coroner has been opened into Pierce&rsquo;s death. That inquest stands adjourned and Deputies will appreciate that it is not appropriate to discuss particular matters in this regard.</P>
        <P>The current Irish legislation, namely, the Coroners Act 1962, is outdated and can no longer be said to equip coroners with the appropriate measures to conduct the best possible death investigation. A commitment to reform has been indicated by the inclusion of a proposed coroners Bill in the Government&rsquo;s current legislative programme. A considerable amount of work has been done in recent years with regard to reviewing the coroner service and in bringing forward proposals for reform. This found its primary expression in the report of the coroners review group in 2000 and in the report of the rules committee published in 2003.</P>
        <P>The review group recommended a comprehensive overhaul and modernisation of the coroner service in Ireland. The coroners&rsquo; rules committee produced a report which proposed the first detailed set of coroners&rsquo; rules for Ireland. These have been widely disseminated since publication and consideration will be given to whether and in what form they might be put on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>There have been significant developments since the publication of these two domestic reports. Ireland is not alone among common law jurisdictions in engaging in reform of the coroners service at this time. In the United Kingdom, the coroner service review has recommended significant structural changes to the coroner services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Another outside influence in our legislative process will be those judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which have a bearing on the work of coroners. The European Court of Justice in recent years has made a number of important decisions in such cases. These cases, involving particular sets of circumstances, have added to the jurisprudence concerning the European convention. Our statutory law needs to be updated to take into account that jurisprudence.</P>
        <P>Reform efforts elsewhere, in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, have been directed towards comprehensive rather than partial reform. We are in a position now to learn from this experience in other countries. The aim of the Minister, as part of the legislative reform, will be to put a more logical and coherent shape to the coroners service. Three broad issues &mdash; legislative, structural and support services &mdash; were considered of equal importance by the review group. Foremost among the issues which the Minister will address in the forthcoming Bill is that of the scope of the coroner&rsquo;s inquiry. The coroners review group considered the issue of the scope of the inquest and, in one of its major recommendations, proposed an extension of the remit of the coroner to &ldquo;establish the surrounding <Col N="975"/>circumstances of death including the medical cause of death&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes we need to make a positive statement of the role of the coroner in inquiring into certain deaths. There is a requirement for greater clarity on the nature of the death investigation by the coroner, up to and including the inquest. Not all death investigations by a coroner necessarily lead to inquests. The new legislation will also set out clearly the procedures for the conduct of inquests by the coroner. With regard to mandatory inquests, there is a requirement for more explicit provisions to deal with those circumstances concerning deaths in custody or of children in care where the State or its institutions have an involvement.</P>
        <P>An issue which has been well highlighted, and no less so in this instance involving the Nowlan family, is that of the summoning and the conduct of witnesses and the taking of evidence at inquests. The Minister has stated on a number of occasions that he intends to abolish the current restriction on the number of medical witnesses the coroner may call to give evidence at an inquest. He also intends to significantly increase the penalty for failure to respond to a summons to appear as a witness or to co-operate at an inquest. The contempt provision available to coroners under the 1962 Act is not satisfactory and is likely to be replaced by providing new powers for the coroner to compel attendance, co-operation and the production of documents.</P>
        <P>The coroners review group was very much concerned about the need to ensure a high quality coroners service with optimal resources and supports. In that regard, it envisaged an evolution to a regionalised structure in which there would be fewer than the current 48 coronial districts. With such a change in structure, it may well be necessary to provide for arrangements for mostly full-time coroners in any new regionalised structure. The Minister is determining the optimum management structure for a reformed coroners service as recommended by the review group. He expects that the proposed new comprehensive coroners Bill will address all current concerns about the law and practice of coroners and will provide a system which will be seen to be effective, humane and accessible.</P>
        <P>Again, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I confirm the commitment to bring proposals for a new coroners Bill to Government before the end of the year.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Local Authority" RHead="Funding">
      <sTitle>Local Authority Funding.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.</P>
        <P>The way in which local authorities are funded has a bearing on their ability to deliver services. I will focus on developing counties such as Kildare. The needs and resources model of fund<Col N="976"/>ing is a historical one. When it was put in place guarantees were given that no council would lose funding. This guarantee automatically placed growing counties at a disadvantage. While the fund has increased over the years, it is not fairly distributed.</P>
        <P>I will outline several practical examples of this unfairness. Kildare County Council does not produce water but buys it from Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council. Given the county&rsquo;s rapid increase in population, the cost of buying water continues to increase. The 2002 census bears no relation to the current population of County Kildare, which has increased by at least 30,000 in recent years. This has resulted in the county&rsquo;s funds being stretched even further.</P>
        <P>While the people of County Kildare are delighted that several new, albeit long overdue, playgrounds have been built, these facilities are expensive to supervise and maintain and receive no funding for maintenance until they are in place and costs can be calculated. The problem with this approach, however, is that there is no guarantee that these costs will ever be included in maintenance funding. In other words, councils take a gamble when they introduce new services.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, during the debate on housing Deputy Fleming criticised some councils for not including sufficient funds for disabled person&rsquo;s grants, for which one third of the cost must be covered by local authorities. The reality is that Kildare County Council has little discretionary spending. Counties Laois and Offaly, on the other hand, do very well from the local government fund and have lower than average commercial rates, which indicates the discrepancy between councils and the improvements that could be made.</P>
        <P>I have analysed a series of figures. Allocations under the local government fund in 2004 indicates that south Dublin receives the lowest <i>per capita </i>transfer at &euro;97, while County Kildare is third worst off. The highest <i>per capita</i> amount is paid to County Leitrim which receives more than &euro;500. The figures demonstrate the considerable variations between local government fund allocations.</P>
        <P>A second set of figures relates to the disabled person&rsquo;s grant. County Kildare receives a <i>per capita</i> allocation of &euro;5.70, the lowest in the State, while Leitrim, at &euro;103 per head of population, again receives the highest allocation. The key issue in this regard is discretionary spending and the failure to understand the dynamics of a growing area. When calculating budgets, certain items, for example, salaries, pensions, insurance, loans, materials, heat and lighting, must be included. However, it is only when one examines areas over which one has discretion that the budget becomes interesting. In a wealthy economy the public has a right to expect services in discretionary expenditure areas, such as community and leisure facili<Col N="977"/>ties, libraries, traffic calming and management, but it is in these areas that counties with growing populations are paying the price in terms of a lack of funding.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>I have also analysed levels of commercial rates. The business sector is critical of increases in rates above the rate of inflation but frequently the choice facing local authorities is whether to reduce services or increase commercial rates. The Minister will no doubt provide figures to show how much the local government fund has increased over the years. It is sobering to note, however, that when I examined the allocation for County Kildare under the fund last year, it was only sufficient to buy additional water for new residents and pay increased costs arising from upgraded wastewater facilities and benchmarking and did not allow an increase in discretionary funding. This is indicative of the problem I have highlighted.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bring the issue of discretionary spending before the Government. Areas such as Kildare, west Dublin, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and north Wexford are entitled to equity in services. It will not be possible to ensure such equity until the disparities in the funding model used is addressed. I ask the Minister to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this matter. I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who apologises for being unable to attend the debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister acknowledges that the level of general purpose grants from the local government fund is of great concern to all local authorities, and the Government&rsquo;s record in this regard is worth noting. The total allocated to local authorities in 2005 through general purpose grants amounts to &euro;817 million. This is an impressive figure in itself and represents an increase of 8.6% over the corresponding figure for 2004, which was 14% above the amount provided in the previous year. Since the Government came to office in 1997, general purpose funding has increased by about 140%, which is many times the rate of inflation over the period. That means central Government has contributed in a real and substantial way to local authorities.</P>
        <P>General purpose allocations over recent years have been made up primarily of two elements, an across-the-board percentage increase on the previous year&rsquo;s allocation and an amount allocated through the needs and resources model. For 2005, across-the-board increases of 7% were allocated to each authority, amounting in total to more than &euro;56.6 million for all authorities. A sum of &euro;12 million was allocated using the model.</P>
        <P>Across-the-board increases provide all local authorities with a basic level of increase over the <Col N="978"/>previous year. Such increases are given in recognition of inflation and the fact that all authorities face many challenges of a similar nature, such as pay increases, each year. For many years following the introduction of the rate support grant in 1998, local authorities complained that the funding distribution system did not have regard to the differing circumstances of each authority. To address this issue the needs and resources model was developed in 2000. It calculates allocations on the basis of the expenditure needs of each authority and the income available from local sources, such as commercial rates, charges for services and miscellaneous fees. At the same time, the model is designed to ensure each authority receives a baseline allocation and does not receive less than in the previous year.</P>
        <P>The calculation of the expenditure needs and local income for each local authority is based on a comprehensive annual return that each local authority provides. This return gives details of actual expenditure and income for each service provided in the latest year for which such data are available. It also provides statistics on each authority&rsquo;s operation such as the number of planning applications, housing applications, housing loans administered, laboratory tests carried out and so on. In addition, details are provided on the extent of the infrastructure local authorities must maintain, including local roads, local authority dwellings and water treatment plants. On the basis of that comprehensive data and appropriate unit target costs and income, the model identifies a funding gap for each authority, which is, in effect, the difference between appropriate expenditure and income. The overall amount available for allocation through the model is distributed primarily in proportion to each authority&rsquo;s funding gap while ensuring that each authority receives its baseline allocation.</P>
        <P>The rules used in assessing appropriate expenditure and income are reviewed regularly to ensure that the model reflects genuine conditions at local authority level. Local authorities are involved in that review process as much as possible. They can also make proposals on changes to the model at any stage. Every year, after the allocations have been made, each local authority is sent a detailed return from the Department indicating how the expenditure and income information supplied by the authority compares with the target costs in the model.</P>
        <P>It is safer to use actual financial data provided by local authorities in assessing funding requirements rather than relying on general projections of growth that may prove unreliable. To use Estimates as opposed to outturns would inevitably lead to a need to reduce retrospectively or claw back funding from local authorities. That could result in deficits and would not be conducive to effective management. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Govern<Col N="979"/>ment, Deputy Roche, has no proposals to change that process. It was endorsed in 2002 by an independent consultancy review commissioned to evaluate the model, which concluded that the use of outturns rather than Estimates is more likely to identity the true spending needs of each authority and provides for a more equitable distribution of the local government fund.</P><Col N="980"/>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s abridged Estimates volume provides welcome news for the local government fund, and the Minister, Deputy Roche, hopes to inform local authorities of their general purposes grants for 2006 in the near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to the priority question on this matter earlier today. I have already advised the House that Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company is currently putting together an application for planning permission which it expects to have ready for lodgement with the planning authority by end-2006. It is not realistically possible to estimate with certainty the length of time that will be required to complete the planning process. Working on the assumption that there is no untoward delay, construction work should commence in early 2007. Construction is scheduled to take 29 months and on that basis the end of 2009 could see completion of the redeveloped stadium.</P>
        <P>In my earlier reply, I also pointed out that the new design has been created in consultation with the different stakeholder groups, including the local residents. As a result, in order to minimise the impact on those living close to the new structure, the design at the north end has been confined to a single level while there are four levels on the east, west and south sides. The revised design is an innovative solution which I hope will be perceived by local residents as going a long way to address their concerns.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I have no responsibility for pub licensing hours &mdash; this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Neither am I familiar with the background or rationale to the extension of pub licensing hours in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>From a tourism perspective, there is no evidence of any pressing need to extend the opening hours for licensed premises beyond those currently in force. The Deputy will be aware that section 1(7) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2004 already takes account of concerns expressed by the hotel sector and parts of the licensed trade about opening hours, by extending the watershed for children from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. during the period from 1 May to 30 September.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently reforming the liquor licensing laws. This, I understand, is a complex process and arises from the need to take account of a broad range of public policy objectives while at the same time seeking to accommodate the demands of a range of interested parties and the general public. I understand that the overall proposal to modernise and streamline licensing law has been broadly welcomed by the licensed trade and drinks industry, the Revenue Commissioners, the Courts Service, the Garda and all the organisations with an interest in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 22 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In July 2005, the Government authorised investigative surveys to be carried out at the George&rsquo;s Dock site to inform further decisions on the development of the theatre there. At my request, the Office of Public Works arranged detailed examination of the site, including archaeological, geotechnical and structural surveys. These studies have now been completed and do not appear to have revealed anything that would cast doubt on the suitability of the site.</P>
        <P>I am currently arranging for the preparation of a report for the Government on the outcome of the OPW investigations with a view to moving forward with my plans for the Abbey Theatre redevelopment project.</P>

	<P>A working group was established under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department, in June 2005, to identify further synergies between the tourism, sport, arts and culture areas of my Department and how <Col N="984"/>they could be advanced to enhance the further development of the sectors concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The terms of reference of this working group &mdash; the synergies implementation group &mdash; are to: identify the arrangements necessary to better package, present and promote our cultural, artistic and sporting products and services; outline the arrangements necessary to leverage and to better co-ordinate with the promotional efforts of bodies outside the remit of my Department; outline the arrangements necessary to better understand and meet customer expectations and requirements in the sectors&rsquo; products and services; to set out a framework for co-operation and communication for the mutual advantage and development of the arts, culture, sport and tourism sectors, including the financial framework within which this work will be taken forward; and to set out the implementation steps that should be taken and the timetable that should follow the finalisation of the report by the implementation group.</P>
        <P>The synergies implementation group includes the chief executives of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, the Irish Sports Council, the directors of the National Concert Hall and National Gallery, as well as senior officials from my Department. My Department provides the secretariat of the group.</P>
        <P>The work of the group is being progressed and is expected to be completed over the coming months with a view to a report being available early in the new year. The group has already consulted with all the agencies and bodies under the Department&rsquo;s remit and with Dublin City Council. Further consultation with other Government Departments is to be undertaken shortly.</P>

	<P>Ireland offers a unique racing experience to the race going public both at home and abroad. I am satisfied that Horse Racing Ireland, in close collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, is very much engaged in marketing that unique experience overseas.</P>
        <P>HRI, as the national authority for racing, includes within its remit the representation of Irish racing abroad. Through its board, its senior executives and its international marketing subsidiary, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, it promotes and enhances the reputation of the Irish <Col N="985"/>thoroughbred industry internationally. Its five year strategic plan specifically prioritises the development and promotion of Ireland as a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding and I have every confidence that it is committing the necessary resources to that task.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the HRI specifically targets overseas visitors to Irish race meetings, particularly racegoers in the UK. For 2006, it has earmarked over &euro;1.5 million for overseas promotion. The UK racegoer in particular presents an outstanding opportunity for inward tourism based on the Irish racing product. It is estimated that in the region of 60,000 UK visitors come racing here each year and the three agencies, Horse Racing Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, consider that there is substantial potential for growth from this market given the fact that in excess of 6 million attendances are recorded annually at race meetings in the UK.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a highly affluent target sector with a propensity to spend on hotels, restaurant, car hire and other forms of entertainment. UK race goers are used to paying as much as double the Irish rate for reserved enclosure access, which, combined with the favourable sterling-euro exchange rate, gives us an unprecedented opportunity to offer a high quality racing experience at relatively better value than is available in the UK.</P>
        <P>In addition to its own initiatives, Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, has a long standing relationship with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in jointly promoting Ireland as a destination for racing tourism. At the behest of my Department, the three agencies are actively exploring possible synergies and, in that context, the HRI specifically identified the Punchestown Festival as an attractive event to grow inbound racing tourism. I understand that discussions between the HRI and the tourism agencies are well underway and I am confident that the combined expertise of the agencies will produce the right result for horse racing and for tourism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>International comparisons are far less simple than initially appears to be the case. Approaches to what is classified as &ldquo;arts&rdquo; spend, for example, can differ quite dramatically from <Col N="986"/>one jurisdiction and context to another. It must also be said that jurisdictions with very high spending across the board also tend to have very high tax rates and that is something that we do not have here. The arts must compete for funding with all other sectors and I have committed myself to securing the best possible deal for the arts in that context. This is the only sensible approach.</P>
        <P>It is also an approach which has paid off in recent years. During my own term as the Minister responsible for the arts, funding for the Arts Council has increased by a total of 28% from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;61 million in 2005 which, as the chair of the council informed the joint committee, has allowed the council to support a record number of artists and arts organisations. This built on earlier increases of about 80% between 1997 and 2002. This does not include the substantial funding provided by my Department for the capital development of arts and culture facilities around the country in recent years: my Department&rsquo;s ACCESS scheme, for example, provided &euro;45.7 million for the development of 44 facilities, including museums, arts centres, theatres, and multi-purpose arts spaces throughout the country.</P>
        <P>These are significant amounts of money in any context, and the amounts of both current and capital funding that have been provided in recent years have transformed the arts, have increased access to the arts and provide an excellent platform for still further developments in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council met with the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs on 19 October 2005. As part of its presentation the council outlined its plans for the next three years under the new strategy for the arts which is to be published in mid-December. This is a three year strategy which seeks to increase Exchequer funding to &euro;100 million by 2008. As part of the first phase of the strategy, the council has sought an allocation of &euro;79.3 million in 2006. Following the meeting, the chair of the joint committee wrote to me in support of the council&rsquo;s request for &euro;79.3 million in 2006, leading to &euro;100 million over a three year cycle.</P>
        <P>It is entirely appropriate for the Arts Council to request such funding as it believes it needs and for the joint committee to express its view. The Government, however, must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society. In this context, I am delighted to confirm that I have secured an allocation of &euro;72.319 million for the council in 2006. That represents an increase of almost 19% on 2005 and almost 38% on 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am, of course, aware of the <i>Bridgestone Guide</i> and I have seen some of the author&rsquo;s comments on the state of the hospitality sector in Ireland. As I understood them, these comments are broadly positive. Indeed, in the words of the author, the <i>Bridgestone Guide</i> purports to &ldquo;sing the good news that we have world-class cooking, world-class chefs and world-class hospitality&rdquo;. People&rsquo;s tastes differ on many things and this is certainly true of food and hospitality critics. In that context, the fact that the author in researching his guide encountered some bad experiences &mdash; which serve to underline the very positive experiences &mdash; should not surprise anybody.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For my part, I tend to rely more on empirical, fact-based research to judge the state of the industry and, for that reason, Failte Ireland&rsquo;s visitor attitudes survey of around 4,000 overseas visitors to Ireland is a vital touchstone. In 2004, the survey showed that: 71% of visitors were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the quality of top grade hotels, grades 4* and 5*, and 71% were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the level of customer service; more than nine in ten were satisfied with the quality of food in hotels &mdash; 53% &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; and 40% &ldquo;fairly satisfied&rdquo;&mdash; and 73% were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the quality of food in restaurants; overall, 95% of visitors felt that their Irish holiday either exceeded, 30%, or matched, 65%, their expectations and 97% said that they would recommend Ireland as a holiday destination; greatest satisfaction was expressed with the Irish people, the scenery, the history and culture &mdash; things that need to be improved include bad roads, poor signposting and the high cost of living, particularly food and drink costs; on environmental issues, 83% of visitors expressed themselves &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the natural and unspoilt environment on offer, 66% were very satisfied with Ireland&rsquo;s attractive cities and towns and 60% were very satisfied that Ireland was litter and pollution free.</P>
        <P>Only 3% of visitors mentioned food quality as a potential disadvantage and only 2% mentioned litter or hygiene. By any yardstick, these results represent a strong endorsement of the quality of the holiday experience in Ireland.</P>

        <P>As the Deputies are aware, I am not responsible for implementing Transport 21. That responsibility lies with my colleague, the Minister <Col N="989"/>for Transport, Deputy Cullen. Any questions regarding the implementation of the plan might be more usefully addressed to him.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome and endorse Transport 21, the Government&rsquo;s radical new initiative to tackle the infrastructure catch up which is required as a result of our unprecedented economic success of recent years. I, my Department and the tourism action plan implementation group have been in close dialogue over the past two years with my colleague, Deputy Cullen, and his Department to ensure that tourism needs are more closely integrated in transport policies and programmes. I believe that Transport 21 addresses this agenda.</P>
        <P>As was the case with the enhancement of the DART, the building of the Luas and the delivery of major new motorways, I do not anticipate any sustained negative tourism fallout from the implementation of Transport 21. Indeed, by delivering a much improved transport infrastructure, the plan should have a positive impact on enhancing tourism growth across all parts of the country.</P>

	<P>The detailed design for the Lansdowne Road stadium project has been completed by HOK Sports with the assistance of Irish architects Scott Tallon Walker and I was very pleased to launch the design for the stadium on 17 October last. The revised design is an innovative solution for the site which now provides more corporate and premium seats than was contained in the initial outline design. The project has been costed at &euro;365 million, including VAT, which includes the increased cost of the improved facilities.</P>
        <P>The January 2004 estimate of the cost of the stadium emerged from a feasibility study which was based on a particular design concept. The detailed design plan and detailed costings now in the public domain relate to a radically different design concept for a much improved stadium, in terms both of design and quality of facilities, compared with that envisaged in the original feasibility study.</P>
        <P>The Government commitment to the project is to provide a maximum of &euro;191 million towards the project with the balance being provided jointly by the IRFU and FAI. The Government commitment to this amount has been reiterated <Col N="990"/>and is accepted and understood by both the IRFU and FAI. Both sports organisations have confirmed that they will meet the additional cost from increased income streams from forward selling of the additional corporate boxes and premium seats.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 32 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>I have no direct responsibility for individual actions or measures relating to tourism promotion or development in so far as specific areas of the country are concerned. These are, at present, day-to-day functions of the State tourism agencies.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in response to a recommendation in the tourism action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group, towards the end of last year commissioned PriceWaterhouseCoopers, PWC, to conduct a major study of regional tourism structures, as it sought to determine how best to carry out its new development mandate countrywide. The report has been published and is available on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website. This work was supplemented by a short engagement facilitated by a small independent group, chaired by Mr. John Travers, with the relevant parties to satisfy interests in the Dublin region that the mechanisms of consultation were complete.</P>
        <P>The PWC report highlights the need for a much wider brief for regional tourism, playing a strategic rather than administrative role and inputting more directly into national policy. It recommends a greatly increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and <Col N="991"/>enterprise support. It suggests establishing an integrated linkage between regional tourism strategy and national policy and exploiting avenues to leverage increased resources.</P>
        <P>At the end of July, I indicated to F&aacute;ilte Ireland that I was satisfied it should proceed with the proposed revision of regional tourism structures on the basis of the PWC and Travers reports. An implementation group has been established to assist F&aacute;ilte Ireland in implementing the recommendations. Mr. Finbarr Flood has agreed to chair this group. It has already begun its work and F&aacute;ilte Ireland expects that changes on foot of its work will be seen in the regions by the middle of next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">National tourism policy has been evolving in recent years, with a particular emphasis on putting policy measures in place to achieve a wider spread of tourism business arising from the New Horizons policy review. The development of good quality direct access to the regions has been a major impediment to growth in the past. Fortunately, this situation has improved greatly in recent times and this summer has seen the greatest ever number of air seats to Ireland, particularly servicing the west. These new routes from Britain, mainland Europe and the US continue to be promoted heavily by Tourism Ireland to optimise their tourism impact.</P>
        <P>Visitors cannot be forced to go to a particular location against their will. The responsibility primarily lies with the individual communities and operators in the regions to present and market compelling attractions, facilities, accommodation and experiences that deliver value for money and quality service. However, at a time of overall national tourism growth, I remain concerned that the issue of regional spread should be proactively and energetically addressed. In that context I am pleased that the programmes and initiatives being operated by the State tourism agencies and the action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group fully reflect this objective.</P>
        <P>Such programmes and initiatives include: the strategic investment in the sustainable development of tourism capital infrastructure in underperforming areas through the tourism product development scheme, which aims to match the quality of the product available on the ground with ever greater consumer expectations; the differential levels of support offered to regional tourism authorities for marketing purposes; an expanded domestic tourism marketing campaign; the use of predominantly rural imagery in the advertising and promotion of Ireland, both at home and abroad; the regional coverage with respect to visiting media; the specific focus on achieving a wide spread of visitors with regard to access transport policies.</P>
        <P>In total this year, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is investing of the order of &euro;27 million on developing regional tourism, from supporting local festivals to building capability and strengthening the tourism <Col N="992"/>product itself. As regards the promotion and development of tourism by the regions themselves, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is channelling in the region of &euro;7.4 million directly into the regional tourism companies to strengthen and enhance their operational and marketing capabilities this year. This investment is designed to ensure both a high quality visitor servicing experience at key tourist information offices and also a strong overseas promotional effort.</P>
        <P>In their programmes for 2005, both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are rolling out a number of innovative approaches which should heighten the regional impact of Ireland&rsquo;s marketing activities both nationally and overseas: all regions will feature prominently in the full range of marketing activities; a dedicated marketing fund for tactical co-operative initiatives with the regional tourism authorities and their members is available for 2005; a region to region approach is being adopted in Britain which is capitalising on direct access links to the regions; specific marketing campaigns involving joint co-operation activities by the regional tourism authorities and other regional interests have been launched for both the western seaboard and the north west this year; a sponsor a region approach has been adopted in Europe whereby each market office is focusing attention alternately on a particular Irish region to enhance the awareness of the local trade of what that region has to offer; an enhanced consumer website with increased functionality and a strong regional input is providing for more dynamic and up-to-the minute packages to entice the domestic traveller; and a strong focus on event based holidays is being complemented by a more streamlined and targeted festivals and cultural events fund which will continue to favour the lesser developed regions.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my detailed reply on this matter to Question No. 5 of 13 October 2005. As I have already indicated, the State tourism agencies are being particularly vigilant about the risk of excessive prices being charged by certain elements of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry in the context of Ryder Cup 2006. In all of their dealings with the industry, they are taking the opportunity to encourage a commonsense approach to the pricing of our tourism products during the staging of the event. For my part, I will continue to raise this issue, as appropriate, in my regular contacts with the industry in the build up to the Ryder Cup.</P><Col N="993"/>
        <P>The Deputy might also note that my Department wrote to the Director of Consumer Affairs earlier this month requesting that a special initiative be undertaken around the time of the Ryder Cup to ensure that price lists in restaurants and public houses are displayed prominently, and has been informed that the appropriate checks will be carried out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is anxious to encourage the construction of attractive, public sports and leisure facilities to ensure that the Government&rsquo;s strategies to promote good health and fitness are advanced. As evidence of this commitment the level of funding provided in 2005 by my Department, at almost &euro;62 million in respect of the sports capital programme, &euro;34 million in respect of the Sports Council and &euro;32 million in respect of the local authority swimming pool programme, shows clearly the Government&rsquo;s increasing commitment to sport and leisure.</P>
        <P>In respect of the local authority swimming pool programme, my Department provides grant aid to local authorities in respect of the capital costs of a new swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs, 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas, subject to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million and the grant is allocated at tender approval stage.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the current programme was 31 July 2000 and since then 55 projects have been or are being dealt with. Of the 55 projects within the programme, 18 have been completed and eight are under construction. Eight are at tender stage and are expected to submit the tender documentation for approval in coming months, thereby allowing construction to commence, 13 are at contract documents stage and eight are at preliminary report stage.</P>
        <P>Eight of the overall 55 projects are in the Dublin area. Of these, two have been completed and are located in Finglas and Ballymun and two are under construction in Ballyfermot and Jobstown. The remaining four projects are at various <Col N="994"/>stages of the programme, that is, the Clondalkin project is at tender stage, the Glenalbyn and Skerries projects are preparing contract documents and the Dundrum project is at preliminary report stage.</P>
        <P>The financial profile of the local authority swimming pool programme over the last five years demonstrates the increasing level of commitment to providing a network of public pools throughout the country. The funding provided for the swimming pool programme over the past three years is &euro;9 million, &euro;15 million and &euro;32 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2005 Estimate provision at &euro;32 million, more than double the 2004 provision, includes a budget allocation of &euro;3.7 million to support the provision of a swimming pool for special needs users at St. Michael&rsquo;s House in Dublin. In addition to the projects funded under the local authority swimming pool programme, the Department has also supported the provision of Ireland&rsquo;s first ever 50 metre pool at the University of Limerick and provided &euro;71 million towards the development of the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that the local authority swimming pool programme is not centrally driven in that it provides grant aid in response to demand by local authorities. It is a matter for local authorities to devise funding and operational arrangements, as they see fit, for the provision of swimming facilities in their areas. Experience shows that there is potential for private sector involvement in the provision and operation of local authority swimming pool facilities and many local authorities are exploring various ways of involving the private sector in their projects.</P>
        <P>My Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the programme, which is examining, among other things, how it has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built under the programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. On completion of this review, the question of re-opening the programme will be considered.</P>

        <Quest>and Tourism his views on the recent figures from the Central Statistics Office showing a fall of almost 5,000 in the number of visitors from North America to Ireland for the first eight months of this year; the reasons for this shortfall and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that, for a variety of reasons, there was a slow start to the North American tourism market this year which has left overall numbers from January to August down less than 1% on last year. However, I am heartened by the fact that according to the latest CSO figures for August, visitor numbers from North America grew by 6.2% over the same month last <Col N="996"/>year. This follows on from an 8.9% increase in July and a 7.2% increase in June over the same months in 2004. These strong summer season results bode well for the growth of the important US leisure market.</P>
        <P>The latest market intelligence available to Tourism Ireland suggests that this trend has continued through the shoulder season and there are grounds for optimism that the year will end with a real increase in the number of US visitors. This would result in Ireland&rsquo;s performance being more or less on a par with our nearest competitors in Europe. Official figures from the US Department of Commerce show that travel by US citizens to Europe only grew by 2% in the first half of this year.</P>
        <P>Air capacity is a key factor in developing the North American market. As was evident in 2004, the large numbers of Irish travelling to the US, particularly in the early part of the year, have restricted the availability of seats at competitive fares for US travellers wishing to visit Ireland. With the new services by American Airlines from Boston and Chicago and the new continental route to Belfast coming on stream in May last, we have seen a far greater take-up of seats by US visitors.</P>
        <P>There are now four major American based carriers serving Ireland, Delta Air Lines, US Airways, Continental Airlines and American Airlines. There has never been a time when so many American carriers have served Ireland. In addition, the number of direct gateway cities has been gradually increasing. In this context, the recent announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on changes to the US-Ireland air bilateral agreement, is extremely significant from a tourism perspective. As I mentioned in an earlier reply, the proposed new arrangements have major potential to open up a range of new air services between Ireland and the United States. According to some tourism industry sources, this agreement gives Ireland the potential to double the number of US visitors by 2012 to two million and should add, each year, an extra 150,000 visitors and &euro;100 million in revenue to the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>It is also very timely in terms of our marketing efforts in this vital market. Tourism Ireland has recently begun a review of the North American market, which follows on from similar reviews of Great Britain and continental Europe. This review aims to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s marketing approach is designed to deliver maximum growth from North America in 2006 and beyond. Tourism Ireland has established consultative steering groups of industry members on both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that a commercial perspective is brought to bear on all aspects of the review&rsquo;s work. Tourism Ireland aims to complete the market review by the middle of 2006.</P>
        <P>In summary, while the US market this year has proven challenging, the scene is now set for a <Col N="997"/>much stronger Irish performance over the coming years.</P>

The Lansdowne stadium project has made very good progress and the company charged with delivery of the project, Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, is finalising the planning application and has set a target of the end of 2005 to have work on this application completed. An innovative detailed design for the stadium has been provided by stadium designers HOK Sport with the assistance of Irish architects Scott Tallon Walker. The redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium, with a crowd capacity of 50,000 all-seated, together with the redeveloped Croke Park, with a crowd capacity of 82,300, should be more than adequate for all the needs of major spectator sport in this country.</P>

	<P>The Government has given a commitment in the programme for Government to complete a national audit of local sports facilities. This work is being undertaken as part of the development of a long-term strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities. There is no proposal at present to carry out an audit of the arts facilities in the country.</P>
        <P>An inter-agency steering group has been established to oversee the development of the sports facilities strategy, part of which will include overseeing the commencement of the proposed audit of sports facilities. Work has commenced on establishing a comprehensive record of national and regional sports facilities with a view to developing an overview on the adequacy of existing key strategic facilities. The Deputy will appreciate that this is one of the building blocks in the formation of an effective long-term strategy. While the Department is undertaking<?oasys _jy?><Col N="998"/><?oasys _fc?>this work internally with the assistance of the Central Statistics Office, there may be a need for external expertise at some future stage, particularly in addressing any of the information technology requirements.</P>
        <P>The audit, when completed, will map the location of the various sports facilities throughout the country and will assist the Government in addressing any gaps that might still exist in Ireland&rsquo;s sporting infrastructure, particularly at regional and national level. While carrying out an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major undertaking, it is hoped to have phase one of the audit completed during 2006, with work commencing thereafter on identifying need at local level.</P>

	<P>As I have previously advised the House, I do not have responsibility for the registration and listing of tourist accommodation facilities as this is a day-to-day function of F&aacute;ilte Ireland under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003. However, I am aware that the bed and breakfast and guesthouse sector has experienced a loss in market share in recent years for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences, growth in urban and short-haul holiday taking and the large addition of budget hotel accommodation stock. In response to concerns about its short and medium term prospects, a strategic review of the bed and breakfast sector was commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Recently, the consultants&rsquo; recommendations were presented to representatives of the sector&rsquo;s main associations for their views.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is continuing to support the bed and breakfast and small and medium-sized accommodation sector through specific marketing initiatives and a range of activities in support of this sector was announced as part of its 2005 marketing and development plans. Programmes include co-operative marketing activities and education programmes for bed and breakfasts, establishment of a representative national forum for guesthouses, working with marketing groups representing one star and two star hotels and support for other accommodation sectors.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 1 on this matter which I gave to the House earlier today.</P>
        <P>The House will recall that the Government decided in 2004 to proceed, as financial resources permit, with the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, undertook an in-depth preparatory process, which included engaging with the major governing bodies of sport and stakeholders, and drew up proposals for the development of the sports campus in a series of phases. Phase one of the development control plan proposes the development of pitches and ancillary accommodation catering mainly for rugby, soccer and Gaelic games, the sports which engage the greatest number of people in Ireland. In addition, an indoor sports centre is planned, to cater for a range of indoor sports with spectator accommodation and publicly accessible all-weather floodlit synthetic pitches are included.</P>
        <P>The Government had an initial discussion on the proposal last September and requested that further analysis be carried out by the Office of Public Works in connection with the delivery of the project. I have now reported to my Cabinet colleagues on the outcome of this additional analysis which will be factored into consideration of my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006-2010 to be published on budget day. I am hopeful that there will be a positive outcome and, in that eventuality, it would be my intention to establish a statutory agency to oversee the Abbotstown project. I am very conscious of the need to have top class sport facilities in place in good time to create opportunities which would promote Ireland as a location for foreign teams wishing to avail of training for the London Olympics in 2012.</P>

	<P>I am very conscious of the fact that our greater economic prosperity over the last number of years has meant that Irish people are in a position to go on holidays more often and further afield. This has also been good for domestic tourism which has seen a significant increase over a similar period. CSO figures show that international trips by Irish residents have increased from 3.77 million in 2000 to 5.46 million trips in 2004, up 1.69 million. Over the same period, domestic travel by Irish residents also increased from 5.48 million to 7 million trips, up 1.52 million. In 2004, a total of 7 million trips were taken within the Republic by Irish residents, with an expenditure of &euro;1 billion. This represents an increase of 5% on the number of domestic trips taken in 2003 while expenditure increased by 7%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">F&aacute;ilte Ireland has responsibility for promoting the home holiday market and has been very active in working with the industry to optimise the increasing potential of the domestic holiday maker. In 2005, some &euro;4 million has been allocated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to home holiday promotion. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s consumer website for the domestic market, <i>Ireland.ie</i>, which was launched early this year, has proven particularly successful in generating quality year round business for the sector. F&aacute;ilte Ireland also publishes the highly successful Discover Ireland series of brochures aimed at the domestic consumer.</P>

        <Quest>the reason a market (details supplied) in County Mayo should be subject to a compulsory labelling system similar to that of big commercial supermarkets; her views on whether this is unfair in view of the fact that the market only operates four hours per week and some during summer months only; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The general labelling of foodstuffs in Ireland is controlled under the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 to 2005. These regulations apply to the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer or for supply to mass caterers. The principle underlying food labelling is that the purchaser must not be misled: thus pre-packaged food sold at markets is not exempt from the labelling requirements that apply to such food sold by other means. However, foodstuffs sold loose, that is, without pre-packaging, such as olives sold from drums or cheese sliced at the request of the consumer, need only indicate the name of the food, either on the label or displayed on a notice near the food.</P>

	<P>The position is that the calculation of the farmers&rsquo; flat rate is governed by EU VAT law and is based on the relevant macroeconomic data for the farming sector for the preceding three years. The purpose of the flat rate addition is to compensate unregistered farmers on an overall basis for VAT which they incur on their business inputs. The flat rate addition is not there to provide any form of income support to farmers or to compensate for increases in wages or costs generally.</P>
        <P>The flat rate refund for unregistered farmers is examined every year in the lead up to the budget. It is not customary for me to comment on any possible changes to the existing rate which may arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent year for which complete information on tax relief is available on local authority service charges is for the income tax year 2002. In that year an estimated number of 124,900 claimants availed of the tax relief for the service charges at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;5.2 million, on the basis of allowable claims in respect of domestic refuse charges totalling &euro;26 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for national waste management policy. I understand from his Department that based on returns received from local authorities in respect of their 2004 adopted budgets, income from domestic refuse charges applied by local authorities themselves is estimated to amount to &euro;113 million for 2004. This figure does not include income accruing to private collectors who are involved in the provision of a waste collection service in 20 of the 34 city/county councils as the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not collect data from this source.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that full data are not available on the total cost of waste collection it is not possible to say what the additional cost to the Exchequer would be if all such charges were fully offset against tax.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the practice of some State agencies of not responding to requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, thereby forcing persons seeking information to pay an additional non-refundable fee of &euro;70 to instigate an appeal in order to satisfy their requests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My attention has not been drawn to the practice referred to by the Deputy and I have no evidence that such a practice exists. Guidelines issued by my Department in relation to FOI fees make it clear that there should be no charge for appeals of the type described by the Deputy.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic20- ?>Section 41 of the Freedom of Information, FOI, Acts 1997 and 2003 provides that a decision to refuse a request for information is deemed to have been made if the public body fails to respond to the request within the required timescale. This entitles the requester to apply for an internal review. Guidelines on FOI fees which have been issued in the form of <Col N="1014"/>central policy unit notice number 11 advise public bodies to exempt an internal review application arising from a deemed decision. The text of CPU notice 11 is available on <i>www.foi.gov.ie</i>.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>If the Deputy considers that a fee has been charged in a case where section 41 applies, I suggest he advise the person affected to bring these guidelines to the attention of the relevant public body. While it may arise from time to time that a public body has difficulty meeting the tight timescales for responding to a request for information, I am satisfied that there is a high level of compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Acts generally. This has been shown in investigations undertaken by the Information Commissioner in 2001 and in 2004.</P>

        <Quest>the exploration licences which have been awarded to oil and gas companies in the recent past; the licences which are being awarded at present; the licences he intends to award in the future; the number and location of these licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Details of current licences, including those recently awarded, are contained in two reports published by my Department. The first of these is the six monthly report on licensing presented to the D&aacute;il under section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960. The second is the acreage report which is published on the Department&rsquo;s website approximately three times each year.

	<P>In September last I published the draft terms and conditions of a proposed new renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme to support the construction of new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants. Interested parties were given the opportunity to raise any queries or to furnish any observations on the proposals <Col N="1017"/>to be delivered to my Department by 12 October last.</P>
        <P>Approximately 30 submissions were received on a variety of issues including the levels of indexation proposed. These submissions have been examined and evaluated and incorporated into the REFIT programme where appropriate. The draft document, as revised, is currently out to legal advice and a full statement including publication of the detailed terms and conditions will occur as soon as legal approval is received and after the practical arrangements to print and make the detailed notes available are completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption.</P>
        <P>On 1 September 2005, the latest date for which comprehensive figures are available, Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="1018"/>emergency oil reserves, whether held at home or in other EU member states, amounted to the equivalent of 116 days of net imports using the IEA methodology. These stocks are made up of: wholly-owned stocks held in Ireland by the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, and industry or oil consumers equivalent to 79 days of stocks; wholly-owned stocks held by NORA in other EU member states under cover of bilateral agreements equivalent to seven days of stocks; and stock held by NORA in the form of &ldquo;stock tickets&rdquo; in other EU member states, under cover of bilateral agreements, equivalent to 30 days of stocks. &ldquo;Stock tickets&rdquo; represent oil stocks which are available to NORA, under commercial contracts, in the event of an oil emergency.
        </P>
        <P Just="Left">In the event of a significant global oil supply disruption, these reserves would be eked out over an extended period to supplement commercial supplies which would still be available in the normal course &mdash; albeit at a reduced level &mdash; so as to provide cover far in excess of their nominal duration. If, for example, there were a 10% reduction in world oil supplies, a level of disruption unprecedented over the past four decades, then it is estimated that our current reserves would last for approximately three years &mdash; longer when combined with the reduction in consumption which would be achieved by the demand restraint measures which would be triggered by a crisis of this magnitude. The IEA also has formal mechanisms for the fair sharing of available oil in the event of a crisis. The locations where Ireland&rsquo;s oil stocks are held are shown in the table, expressed in days.

        <Quest>his proposals to ensure the future of the day after postal delivery service in rural areas in the face of the imminent deregulation of letters of every weight and the consequent competition for An Post in the major urban areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The liberalisation of the postal sector is provided for in the European Directives 97/67/EC and 2002/39/EC, which set out the requirements for member states on the provision of high quality postal services and liberalisation within their postal networks. <Col N="1018"/>Under the directives, each member state is obliged to provide a universal service whereby a minimum level of service must be provided including a delivery no less than five days a week. Both of these directives have been transposed into Irish law in S.I. 616 of 2002, European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation in Ireland has already commenced and since the transposition of the directives, the weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area and therefore not open to competition has been reduced to 100g from 2003 with a price limit of three times the basic tariff for domestic and inbound international. The reserved area will be further reduced to mail weighing 50g or less and two and a half times the basic tariff from 2006 for <Col N="1019"/>domestic and inbound international. Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004. The second directive also stipulates that the postal sector is to liberalise across the EU in full on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement. There are no proposals to change the nature of the universal service.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the detailed reply I gave to the House yesterday regarding this incident. There are currently two investigations underway in the Department on this matter. One is being undertaken by the maritime safety directorate to determine if the vessel used to transport the people to the island was certified or licensed in compliance with the relevant maritime safety legislation. The second is being undertaken by seafood control division into whether the person gathering or organising the gathering of periwinkles was in full compliance with their responsibilities under relevant food safety legislation. Both investigations are ongoing and, as can be appreciated, I cannot comment further until the reports of the investigations are completed.</P>

	<P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities.</P>
        <P>Since 1998, over &euro;385 million has been allocated under the sports capital programme to some 4,900 projects in villages, towns and parishes throughout the country. In that period, the annual allocation increased by nearly 720% from just over &euro;7.5 million in 1998 to almost &euro;54.4 million in 2005. Of that allocation in 2005, a total of over &euro;11.4 million was for projects classified as community-mixed, which would include recreational facilities provided in community centres and community based facilities and projects where more than one sport or recreational activity was available.</P>
        <P>The local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, provides grant aid towards the capital costs of a new pool swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs &mdash; 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas &mdash; subject to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million. The current round of the pool programme was closed to applications on 31 July 2000 and the priority in respect of the programme is to support the 55 projects that applied for funding prior to the closing date. Since 2000, just over &euro;70 million has been allocated towards the cost of pool projects.</P><Col N="1021"/>
        <P>My Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the programme, which is examining, among other things, how it has worked to date, the benefits that have accrued to the areas where pools have been built under the programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. On completion of this review, the question of reopening the programme will be considered. Given the significant increase in investment I have outlined above, it is clear that there has been a considerable improvement in the level of sport and recreational facilities being provided all over the country.</P>
        <P>However, my Department continually assesses the economic and social potential of sport and has recently established an inter-agency steering group to oversee the development of a sports facilities strategy. The group comprises representatives from my Department along with officials from the Departments of Education and Science, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance in addition to representatives of the Irish Sports Council, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association.</P>
        <P>One of the first challenges facing the group is to oversee the commencement of a national audit of sports facilities that will help define the level of need that still exists in the sports sector and in helping to determine future priorities. While work has only just commenced on the development of the strategy, the final report is likely to include recommendations on a whole range of issues, including improved co-ordination and integration of funding among the various Departments and bodies to ensure effective planning for sports facilities in the future.</P>

	<P>Statistics relating to the section 481 scheme, appended herewith, indicate that, with the exception of 2003, there has been a decline in film production in Ireland in recent years. The Government has taken a positive and proactive approach to support for the Irish film industry. The section 481 scheme for investment in film production has been extended to at least 2008 with the amount that can be raised increased from &euro;10.48 million to &euro;15 million from 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The promotion of film making in Ireland and Ireland as a location for international film production is the responsibility of the Irish Film Board. My Department&rsquo;s funding of the board increased relative to the previous year by over 9% in 2004 and a further 22% in 2005. However, there are many factors that impact on film production that we cannot control. Unfavourable exchange rates, aggressive competition from new jurisdictions, the entry into the market of new and lower cost locations have all had an effect. Changes to incentive schemes elsewhere have also caused difficulty for the attraction of film production here.</P>
        <P>In close consultation with the Irish Film Board, I am constantly monitoring and reviewing the situation and considering how I can best contribute. Of course, it also falls to the industry itself to optimise efficiency, control costs and offer the very best professionalism and supports to those considering making films here. </P><Col N="1021"/>

        <P>Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council, a body funded by my Department but independent on a day-to-day basis. During my own term as the Minister responsible for the arts, funding for the Arts Council has increased by 28% from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;61 million in 2005, which, as the chair of the council informed the joint committee, has allowed the council to support a record number of artists and arts organisations. This built on earlier increases of approximately 80% between 1997 and 2002.</P>
        <P>This does not include the very substantial funding also provided by my Department for the capital development of arts and culture facilities around the country in recent years. My Department&rsquo;s ACCESS scheme, for example, provided &euro;45.7 million for the development of 44 facilities including museums, arts centres, theatres and multi-purpose arts spaces throughout the country. These are significant amounts of money in any context and the amounts of both current and capital funding that have been provided in recent years have transformed and increased access to the arts and provide an excellent platform for even further developments in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
        <P>The House will recall that the Government decided in 2004 to proceed, as financial resources permit, with the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, undertook an in-depth preparatory process, which included engaging with the major governing bodies of sport and stakeholders, and drew up proposals for the development of the sports campus in a series of phases. Phase one of the development control plan proposes the development of pitches and ancillary accommodation catering mainly for rugby, soccer and Gaelic games, the sports which engage the greatest number of people in Ireland. In addition, an indoor sports centre is planned to cater for a range of indoor sports, with spectator accommodation and publicly accessible all weather floodlit synthetic pitches also included.</P>
        <P>The Government had an initial discussion on the proposal last September and requested that further analysis be carried out by the Office of Public Works in connection with the delivery of the project. I have now reported to my Cabinet colleagues on the outcome of this additional analysis which will be factored into consideration of my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006-2010 to be published on budget day. I am hopeful that there will be a positive outcome and, in that eventuality, it would be my intention to establish a statutory agency to oversee the Abbotstown project.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the need to have top class sport facilities in place in good time to create opportunities which would promote Ireland as a location for foreign teams wishing to avail of training for the London Olympic Games in 2012. There have been no capital costs incurred on the project to date in 2005.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s budget for <Col N="1025"/>sport this year is over &euro;149 million, as compared with an amount of just &euro;17.4 million in 1997. The Government has spent over &euro;700 million on sport since 1997. This hugely increased investment in sport has resulted in a considerably enhanced range and quality of programmes and top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres throughout the country. We are already beginning to see the benefits of this phenomenal increase in new investment in sport and we will continue to reap the benefits as time goes on.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s support for sport has not just been a matter of simply making more money available. Improvements have had to be made in a strategic way. The establishment in 1999 of the National Sports Council as the statutory body with responsibility for the organisation and development of sport was a vital leap forward in this regard. This Government is committed to providing the necessary infrastructure on which the Sports Council&rsquo;s strategy based on the three pillars of participation, performance and excellence can be delivered.</P>
        <P>The budget for the Irish Sports Council has increased from &euro;13.2 million in 2000, its first full year of operation, to &euro;34.4 million in 2005 and in all the council has received since its inception almost &euro;158 million. This level of funding is enabling the council to support a wide range of programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing the involvement of people of all ages in the complete spectrum of sports and promoting social cohesion and enhanced community involvement in all aspects of sport. Additional funding for the council in 2005 included &euro;1.5 million for an initiative being taken to preserve and develop the games of hurling and camogie on a nationwide basis, &euro;1 million to support initiatives aimed at the development of Gaelic games in Dublin and &euro;750,000 to commence programmes which attract women into sport.</P>
        <P>The sports capital grant scheme operated by my Department has a major impact on the delivery of all sporting disciplines in every corner of the country, providing the facilities that allow programmes and activities take place that will bring and keep young people in sport. This programme has, since 1998, allocated funding of over &euro;385 million to some 4,900 projects to provide badly need facilities and equipment in virtually every parish, village, town and city, ranging from community centres and facilities for small local clubs in every sport to national sports centres.</P>
        <P>The local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, provides grant aid towards the capital costs of a new pool swimming pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs, 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas, subject to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million. The current round of the pool prog<Col N="1026"/>ramme was closed to applications on 31 July 2000 and the priority in the programme is to support the 55 projects that applied for funding prior to the closing date. Since 2000, just over &euro;70 million has been allocated towards the cost of pool projects.</P>
        <P>My Department is continually assessing the economic and social potential of sport and has recently established an inter-agency steering group to oversee the development of a sports facilities strategy. One of the first challenges facing the group is to oversee the commencement of a national audit of sports facilities which will help define the level of need that still exists in the sports sector and in helping to determine future priorities. While work has only just commenced on the development of the strategy, the final report is likely to include recommendations on a whole range of issues including improved co-ordination and integration of funding among the various Departments and bodies to ensure effective planning for sports facilities in the future.</P>

	<P>My Department was not directly involved in carrying out capital projects of between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million in 2004 or 2005. However, within my Department&rsquo;s agencies, two projects were approved for funding within this cost range.</P>
        <P>One capital project was approved for grant aid of &euro;48.25 million by IDA Ireland in 2004. This request was underpinned by a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed assistance. No claim has yet been made by the grantee against this approval, and consequently no cost has been incurred by the State in respect of this project to date. It is the practice of IDA Ireland to undertake a cost-benefit analysis in all cases considered for grant aid.</P>
        <P>The F&Aacute;S board approved the replacement of the F&Aacute;S Tallaght training centre in 2004. This project has an expected gross cost to the State in the region of &euro;30 million. However, the net cost is likely to be closer &euro;22 million, as F&Aacute;S plans to sell land on the site of the existing training centre. Before the project was sanctioned by my Department, there was an extensive analysis of the long-term need for this project and a number of detailed options were considered. The costs of this project in 2004 and 2005 are &euro;1million and &euro;1.3 million respectively.</P>

	<P>Staff in my Department offer a comprehensive and multifaceted service through our network of local and branch offices. Appointment systems are in place for many of the services that we offer: for example, appointments are arranged for customers who wish to see a facilitator to discuss educational and work opportunities or who are required to be interviewed by a social welfare inspector in connection with their claim. Customers attending to sign the unemployment register are given specific dates on which they are required to sign.</P>
        <P>Large numbers of customers attend our offices on a daily basis in order to make applications for various schemes, to sign the unemployment register or to discuss elements of their claim and seek information on the Department&rsquo;s services. While delays can occur from time to time, every effort is made to deal with customers promptly. The majority of our local offices now offer a lunchtime service, which provides customers greater flexibility in attending the office.</P>
        <P>It is not feasible to give every customer an appointment in view of the number of customers attending our local offices and the wide variety of services provided. Any customer who has a particular difficulty in attending at the local office or who has special needs should contact the manager so that an appropriate arrangement can be made to facilitate their particular circumstances.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to introducing a personal entitlement for pensioner spouses currently in receipt of the qualified adult allowance, QAA, set at a level of a full non-contributory pension. In budget 2004, the rate of QAA, for persons aged 66 and over, payable to invalidity pensioners was brought up to the level applicable to equivalent QAAs on old age contributory and retirement pensions. This required a total special increase of &euro;16.10 per week for the relevant invalidity pension QAAs and was the first step towards the fulfilment of the Government&rsquo;s commitment.</P>
        <P>The cost, based on current rates of payment, of bringing all of the relevant QAA rates up to the level of the contributory pension personal rate is &euro;47 million in a full year. In that context, further progress on aligning the relevant rates would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health board payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks, from end-September to mid-April, and are not intended to meet the full cost of heating. Some 274,000 &mdash; 151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement &mdash; benefit under the scheme at a cost of &euro;85.4 million in 2005.</P>
        <P>Eligibility is subject to means. People who already qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pen<Col N="1030"/>sion, long-term unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment need not undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In addition, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people who are participating on approved employment schemes such as back to work allowance and community employment to retain entitlement to secondary benefits, including the fuel allowance, subject to a weekly household income limit of &euro;317.43.</P>
        <P>In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to &euro;51 per week, or savings/investments of up to &euro;46,000, over and above the maximum contributory pension rate used for reference purposes, and still qualify for fuel allowance. The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in this reference pension rate.</P>
        <P>Any changes in the means rules or other conditions of the scheme would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

        <P>Facilitating return to work or participation in the active labour force is one of the main objectives of the social welfare system. There are a number of specific employment and training incentives available within the system to encourage and facilitate people with illness or disability to take up available work or training options. These include exemptions from the general &ldquo;no work&rdquo; conditions of the disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes to facilitate a person to undertake employment of a rehabilitative nature. These exemptions are usually granted for a period of 12 months but may be renewed for a further period, subject to review, if a person seeks an extension.</P><Col N="1032"/>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s expenditure review initiative, a review of illness and disability schemes identified a number of areas where employment supports could be strengthened within the system and across Departments. The review recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a recognition of the fact that some people&rsquo;s medical and other circumstances may mean that they have some capacity for work but may never achieve full-time work, that employment support measures should not act as a disincentive for people with disabilities and long-term illnesses in maximising their employment and earnings, that a range of employment supports be put in place for different groups, ensuring that clients are referred to the most suitable option, having regard to the nature of their illness or disability and age, social circumstances and so forth, and the introduction of early intervention measures aimed at re-integrating people who sustain serious illnesses, injuries and disabilities into the workforce before they become long-term dependant on social welfare payments.</P>

	<P>The management and operation of Shannon Airport, including compliance with the Public Health (Tobacco)(Amendment) Act 2004, is a day-to-day matter for Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and I have no function in relation to the matter. However, the DAA informed me that it has provided an external smoking area for use by any passengers using Shannon Airport who wish to smoke. The DAA further informs me that separate smoking facilities are not provided specifically for US military personnel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Evaluation is an integral part of any <Col N="1035"/>programme or initiative and, on the local drugs task force, LDTF, process, it was agreed by all the parties involved in developing the programme that, in addition to evaluating the overall process to measure its success or otherwise, individual projects being funded through the initiative would also be evaluated. In 2000, an evaluation, at an approximate cost of &euro;276,000, was carried out on 142 projects funded under the first round of LDTF plans and, as a result, 122 of those projects were mainstreamed with effect from 1 January 2001.</P>
        <P>It is likely that further evaluations in respect of projects funded under the second round of LDTF plans, and those first-round projects which were not already mainstreamed, will get under way in 2006. A review of the structures of the LDTF process was carried out by consultants Burkenshaw Kenny in 2002 at a cost of &euro;67,000.</P>
        <P>Under the expenditure review initiative, which operates in all Departments, a review of the LDTF process has been carried out and the findings of that review are being finalised by my Department at present. The cost of the review was approximately &euro;81,000 and it is my intention to publish its findings in the near future.</P>
        <P>On the broader level, my Department organised the carrying out of a mid-term evaluation of the national drugs strategy and the findings of that review were published in June of this year. The review was overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department, and made up of representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors.</P>
        <P>The steering group found that the aims and objectives of the national drugs strategy are fundamentally sound. The report shows that there are encouraging signs of progress since 2001 when the strategy was first launched, indicating that our current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective. At the same time, however, the report highlights the need to refocus priorities and accelerate the roll out of some of the strategy&rsquo;s actions and, in this context, a number of new actions and amendments have been identified. These changes will strengthen the strategy and enable it to better deliver its aims. The cost to my Department of engaging consultants for this review was approximately &euro;76,600.</P>

All wood preservatives are currently being reviewed and evaluated at European Community level as part of the implementation of this directive and copper chrome arsenate is not being defended under this process. As a result, all Irish and European uses of copper chrome arsenate as a wood preservative will cease from 1 September 2006.</P>

	<P>In the discussion document, Immigration and Residence in Ireland, which I published in April of this year and circulated to all Members of this House, it is proposed that a new status of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo; should be introduced in the forthcoming Immigration and Residence Bill. There is currently no separate status of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo; in the Irish immigration system. While a person could after a period of time obtain permission to remain without condition as to time, this still left some uncertainty as to the entitlements associated with it. There has been criticism that the only effective long-term residence status which a non-national could obtain in Ireland is by way of naturalisation.</P>
        <P>In the development of the Immigration and Residence Bill, my Department is currently working on a scheme for granting long-term residence status. The model which would be followed is broadly in line with the European Council directive on the status of long-term residents.</P>
        <P>As regards the possibility of granting long-term resident status to applicants for naturalisation, I should point out that when a future scheme is introduced, the granting of long-term resident status will not be an automatic process. The process must be initiated by an application from an eligible migrant. While the criteria for long-term resident status are likely to be less onerous than the requirements for naturalisation, all applications for long-term resident status will nonetheless have to be assessed on their individual merits.</P>

	<P>Delivering equality of opportunity in schools, or DEIS, is the new action plan for educational inclusion, which will be introduced on a phased basis starting during the current school year. It aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.</P>
        <P>The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of around &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally. A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the educational research centre on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, 300 of which are urban and 300 of which are rural, along with 150 second level schools, will be included in a new school support programme, or SSP. The SSP will bring together a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. It is anticipated that the identification process will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>All recognised primary and second level schools are required to offer relationships and sexuality education. It is an integral part of the social, personal and health education curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle second <Col N="1043"/>level, where it has been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for junior cycle and senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the relationships and sexuality education aspects of the curriculum. An integrated social, personal and health education programme at senior cycle incorporating relationships and sexuality education is being developed.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of the social, personal and health education curricula are to foster the personal development, health and well-being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens; to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making; to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</P>
        <P>At primary level, social, personal and health education is one of the seven curriculum areas in the revised primary school curriculum that was introduced in 1999. Social, personal and health education has been implemented in all schools since September 2003 and is taught to pupils from junior infants class upwards to sixth class. One of the three strands within social, personal and health education is Myself. The strand units within this include &ldquo;taking care of my body&rdquo;, &ldquo;growing and changing&rdquo; and &ldquo;safety and protection&rdquo;. This means that pupils from the beginning of their primary schooling learn, in an age appropriate way, how their bodies develop, the importance of caring for one&rsquo;s body and that of others with dignity and respect and how to identify people, places and situations that may threaten personal safety.</P>
        <P>The social, personal and health education modules at junior cycle in second level schools deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy. Two of the social, personal and health education modules relate specifically to relationships and sexuality and personal safety.</P>
        <P>The aims of these modules include bringing students to an understanding of the physical changes that take place during adolescence and exploring with them procedures for protecting their personal safety along with appropriate responses when their safety is threatened. In third year, an awareness of help agencies is promoted and students&rsquo; skills for obtaining access to them are developed. For senior cycle students, all <Col N="1044"/>schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place. The relationships and sexuality education programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and addresses issues such as pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and accepting sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has developed two sets of resource materials that are particularly relevant to this area for use with transition year and senior cycle students as part of an social, personal and health education programme. These are &ldquo;BALANCE &mdash; Who cares?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Exploring Masculinities&rdquo;. These resources use a variety of materials and strategies to explore and discuss issues of gender equality. Specific attention is paid to addressing both sexual harassment and domestic violence in both resources. Also included in the &ldquo;Exploring Masculinities&rdquo; resources are materials on bullying and child sexual abuse.</P>
        <P>All second level schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive <i>ex quota</i> hours from the Department for this provision. Guidance counsellors are qualified to provide counselling support to students who may have suffered abuse and to assist them in accessing appropriate help when needed.</P>

	<P>Child protection guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, which were distributed to primary and post-primary schools in 2001 and 2004 respectively, were produced in consultation with the partners in education to meet the needs for schools to have in place clear procedures which teachers and other school staff should follow where they suspect, or are alerted to, possible child abuse. The guidelines cover four different types of abuse; neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse and sexual abuse. The guidelines provide management authorities and staff with guidance in recognising the signs and symptoms of child abuse and with procedures for dealing immediately with such concerns.</P>
        <P>A central facet of the guidelines is the requirement for each board of management to designate a senior member of staff as the designated liaison person for the school. The designated liaison person will act as a liaison for the school in all dealings with the Health Service Executive, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other parties, in connection with <Col N="1045"/>allegations of or concerns about child abuse and as a resource person to staff who may have child protection concerns.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that, in its pre-budget submission dated 3 November 2005, the TUI recommended that no less than &euro;50 million be provided in 2006 to commence the imple<Col N="1047"/>mentation of the recommendations contained in the McIver report on the PLC sector.</P>
        <P>The McIver report on the PLC sector contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating over 90 sub-recommendations. The principal recommendations are: a reduction in the number of timetabled class teaching hours and appropriate increases in staff to compensate; enhancement of senior and middle management structures to allow more time for assessment, student support and interaction, team development and cross-curricular planning, industry liaison and quality assurance processes; an increase in technical and administrative support staff; and improvements in student library, IT and social facilities and capital infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the number and scope of the recommendations in the report, extensive consultations have been held with management and staff interests with regard to such issues as the prioritisation of recommendations, the structural changes envisaged in the report, their implications and associated costs in the context of the overall provision of resources for further and adult education. These consultations are continuing.</P>

My Department has been engaged in giving detailed consideration to the submissions received and I intend to publish the final guidelines in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The new guidelines will recommend that the key areas within the planning authority&rsquo;s functional area where there is significant wind energy potential should be identified on development plan maps. Under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their functions. I intend to keep the implementation of the guidelines by planning authorities under review following publication.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 to 147, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>An application for funding under the voluntary housing capital loan and subsidy scheme has been received from Fingal County Council in respect of this project and clarification on a number of aspects sought from the council is awaited. When this is to hand the application will be further considered and officials from my Department will, if necessary, meet with the local authority and voluntary body to discuss ways in which the project may be progressed.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the scheme, including certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme and the level of support available from other State bodies, is the responsibility of the local authority, in this instance Fingal County Council. Local authority development plans set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the plan which should be informed by the housing strategy required under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the steps taken by his Department to ensure that local authorities deal humanely with the welfare of animals they impound; and if there is a programme in place for neutering, spaying and micro-chipping the animals and ensuring that as many animals as possible are re-homed.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 place statutory responsibility for dog control on local authorities. <Col N="1057"/>The implementation of the Acts is vested in local authorities who have power to appoint dog wardens, to provide shelters for stray and other dogs, to impose on-the-spot fines for several offences and to initiate prosecutions. Local authorities may also make by-laws regarding the control of dogs within their functional areas.</P>
        <P>The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 require the owner or other person in charge of a dog to ensure that the dog at all times wears a collar bearing the name and address of the owner on an attached plate, badge or disc. The regulations contain penalties for non-compliance with this requirement or for defacing or rendering illegible the above particulars. Those arrangements followed consideration of all practicable options for ensuring identification of dogs, including that of micro-chipping, and are being kept under review.</P>
        <P>While there is no specific programme for the neutering and spaying of dogs, my Department has provided funding in recent years to the Irish Blue Cross, a volunteer-operated charity, for its subsidised neutering programme for dogs of needy pet owners.</P>
        <P>The number of dogs being destroyed decreased from 27,848 in 1997 to 16,598 in 2004. The number of stray dogs being re-homed each year increased from 4,681 in 1998 to 7,939 in 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council. Under the relevant provisions of the Act, a proposal to establish a town council, and the timing of any such proposal, is a matter for the local community in the first instance, with a decision on such a proposal being a reserved function of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process. Part 17 also allows for the first elections to new town councils to proceed independently of the normal local election cycle.</P><Col N="1058"/>
        <P>I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act, and I have initiated consultation with local government interests regarding the creation of new town councils and their prospective functional responsibilities under the Act. Local government services in the Ballincollig and Carrigaline areas are provided by Cork County Council and my Department has not been contacted regarding any current plans by the community to develop proposals for the establishment of town councils in those areas.</P>

	<P>On 18 May 2005 my Department invited each city and county council to apply for grant assistance towards the provision of one skateboard park in its area. All applications received were evaluated on a competitive basis by my Department in conjunction with the National Children&rsquo;s Office having regard to the following criteria which had been notified to local authorities at the time applications were sought: design, layout and location of the proposed park; perceived demand for a facility in the area and potential usage; cost of the project; projected time scale within which the project is to be commenced and completed; ability of the local authority to complete the project in the time scale proposed; availability of a site; arrangements for ongoing management and maintenance; and general quality of the proposal.</P>
        <P>The information requested in respect of each of the applications is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>In the case of County Louth, Louth County Council submitted two proposals and was, accordingly, asked to prioritise them. The council indicated on 4 October 2005 that it had decided to give priority to the Dundalk proposal, which was subsequently approved for a grant. </P><Col N="1057"/>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the number of capital projects within his Department which in 2004 and in 2005 had an estimated cost of between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million, and which would have been subject to cost-benefit analysis if the newly announced criteria for such evaluations had then been in force; and the total cost of such projects in each year.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the <Col N="1060"/>revised capital appraisal guidelines published in February 2005, a cost-benefit analysis is to be carried out by the sponsor of each public capital project with a value of over &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>Some 19 projects sponsored by local authorities within the annual public capital programmes for 2004 and 2005 regarding housing regeneration, water services and non-national roads exceed this threshold. In so far as their timing may bring them within the new guidelines, the carrying out of the required cost-benefit analysis will be for the local authority concerned. My Department&rsquo;s role would be that of sanctioning authority.</P>
